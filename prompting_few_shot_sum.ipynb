One night she sees him being put into a van and taken away by the neighborhood patrols. As time goes by, she soon discovers that children who go against the teachings of the neighborhood are taken to a factory where they are turned into fertilizer, and do indeed become evergreen. Eventually, the neighborhood council deems Jenna to be a threat to the neighborhood, and she is taken to the plant to become evergreen herself.\\n'\n",

Farnsworth|Professor]]. Until Bender can satisfy his lust for bending and overcome his sleepwalking, he is forbidden from returning to [[Planet Express]].\\n\\nBender finds work at a factory where all the workers are on strike. After securing a job Bender is introduced to his co-workers: an attractive fembot, [[Angleyne]] and [[Flexo]]. Bender flirts with Angelyne who enjoys his advances and falls in love with him. Bender helps Angelyne bend and the two share a kiss before dating, things are fine until he makes a shocking discovery: Flexo and Angelyne are divorced. Naturally Bender perceives Flexo as a threat to his romance and attempts to find out who Angelyne loves by taking her to [[The Hip Joint]] posing as Flexo. After a passionate kiss leads to Bender's disguise being foiled, he takes off to the factory to kill Flexo. Unfortunately, the [[Robot Mafia]] also want to kill Flexo which they attempt by dropping an unbendable girder on him. Angelyne arrives on the scene too late, but she rushes to crippled Flexo's side professing her love for him. Bender, wanting to make Angelyne happy, decides to bend the girder to save Flexo. After succeeding Bender returns to Planet Express, his bend lust satisfied, but gets irate after being bugged to de-bend the Professor, so he simply bends him 180 degrees much to the dismay of his co-workers.\\n\"\n",
