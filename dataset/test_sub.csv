1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"good evening. how did you find me? i specifically asked for an unlisted channel. i'm taking the week off. i wanted a rest from television. if you're one of those critics who thinks that television is frightful... all i can say is you should see it from this side. i've been reading the want ads. a man has a right to look around for a better job. ""wanted: host for television program."" sounds like a job for me. ""must be witty, charming, handsome."" why, this is perfect. ""gracious. and must be willing to work every week. ""apply: alfred hitchcock presents. "" i think i better scamper back to the old job. i don't want to miss the show. and don't you miss it, either. there, i guess that covers everything. i've used a slightly different approach on this one. read it to me. all right, dear. ""april 9. ""box 111. ""post office annex, city. dear sir... ""regarding your advertisement in the help wanted section of the news... ""of this date. ""if the position has not been filled... ""i should like to present my qualifications for your consideration. ""my age is 52 as of last october. ""i have been married for 27 years, have no family, my health is excellent."" that's a blessing. now, laura. we're going to have you up and around in no time. just as soon... to go on. ""for 31 years, i was employed by the firm of stowe and baker... ""the accounting and audit company, in the capacity of clerk. ""i believe my record for attendance and punctuality stands alone. ""the termination of my services was due entirely to my age... ""a short-sighted policy... ""which i feel certain already has been regretted by the individuals at fault."" now, dear. you mustn't excite yourself. that's all over and done with now. it doesn't do any good to brood over it. i know, laura. but every time i think of it... that personnel manager telling me i was too old. too old? i can still do that job better than anybody they can get... at the salary they were paying me. it just makes me see red all over again. we're not going to think about that. you're right, laura. i just... get all excited and i just burn with shame. in 52 years, laura... it was the only time i really lost my head. makes you wonder sometimes how far you might let yourself go. hello. yes, this is mr. crabtree. yes, i answered the advertisement. i have been considering your letter of application, mr. crabtree. i must say i found it to be an excellent one. thank you, sir. thank you very much. you gave as a reference the firm of stowe and baker. i took the liberty of telephoning them. of course. the personnel manager, while reluctant to discuss the matter... did inform me that when told you were being retired... you attempted to attack him physically. is this true, mr. crabtree? yes, i'm afraid it is. i don't know what came over me. the terrible injustice of it, i guess. you see, i desperately needed that job. my wife, she's been ill. it could never happen again, i assure you. very well. my secretary will call on you within an hour. good day, mr. crabtree. i wonder what could be delaying her? he said she'd be here in an hour. it's longer than that now. but isn't it rather strange that someone should come here to interview you? yeah, if she does come. won't you come in, please? mr. crabtree? yes. i believe you were expecting me. yes, i was. this is mrs. crabtree, my wife. miss? brown. how do you do? i'm happy to know you, miss brown. won't you sit down? thank you. your job, mr. crabtree, will consist of preparing confidential reports... which must be mailed to your employer. mailed? but why? because you will be working alone in your own office... with no direct supervision and no assistants. you mean i'm going to be in charge? miss brown, i hope i didn't misrepresent my previous experience. i've always held a job as an employee. that has been understood. now, your office will receive subscriptions... to a number of financial journals. you will be supplied with a list of important corporations. whenever one of these corporations is referred to in the journals... you will make a note of it, and consolidate these into a report... which must be mailed at the end of every day. i quite understand, miss brown. but to whom do i mail these reports? to the box number you already have, of course. oh. the office is completely prepared for you. and here are your keys. thank you. your hours will be 9:00 to 5:00, and half day on saturday. can you start in the morning? yes, i think so. yes, of course. now as to your salary. you will be paid $100 a week. is that satisfactory? one hundred? well, yes. that's very generous, indeed. you will receive your salary every saturday in cash, by mail. and here is the address of your office. are there any further questions? no. well, yes. i'm afraid i don't quite understand the reason for all- you are not expected to, mr. crabtree. your work is important and highly confidential. the less you know of it... the less temptation there will be to discuss it with anyone. i wouldn't do that. you can absolutely depend on my discretion. very well. good luck. goodbye, mrs. crabtree. goodbye, miss brown. goodbye and thank you very much. $100 a week! it's wonderful but... now you can have your treatments, laura. and after we've saved a little, the operation. it seems too good to be true. ""crabtree affiliated reports."" i can't explain it exactly. it's like working in a vacuum. all these weeks and i really don't know what i'm doing. i'm sure there's a good reason for it, dear. take those reports. amalgamated, steady as a rock. efficiency instruments, exploring new techniques. universal, this or that. i can't make head or tail out of it. your work must be satisfactory or you would have heard from him. sometimes i wonder if he even remembers i'm there. i have a feeling that i'm just a name on a payroll... and, someday, someone is gonna ask... who is this man, crabtree? why are we paying him $100 a week? and nobody will know the answer. but you are being paid and that's a blessing. yes. and the treatments are doing you a world of good. a few more months and we'll have saved enough for the hospital. if the job lasts. we won't think about that. no, of course not. now, don't overdo it. goodbye, dear. goodbye. come in, mr. crabtree. and shut the door, please. yes, of course. i seem to have startled you. yes, i... what are you doing here? who are you? i think that should be quite obvious. i'm your employer. you seem surprised, mr. crabtree. why, yes. i was beginning to wonder. of course, it's a very pleasant surprise. i've been looking forward to meeting you, mr... have you any complaints about your job? no, it's been thoroughly enjoyable. my reports have been satisfactory, i hope. very likely. i haven't read them. i understand... you'd hardly have time to give them your personal attention. you're quite wrong there, mr. crabtree. i personally burn them. you burn them? on arrival. but i don't understand. you must be joking. if you knew me a little better, mr. crabtree... you'd realize that i'm almost totally devoid of a sense of humor. that's one of the penalties of devoting one's entire energies... to accumulating a vast fortune. but why? why pay me to prepare reports if you're gonna burn them? it had its purpose, i assure you. incredible as it may sound, mr. crabtree, i need you. that is, i need a loyal, conscientious employee... to handle an important assignment. then you're not going to terminate my services? that depends entirely on you. if this assignment is completed successfully... you will receive one year's salary in advance... and no more reports to mail. one year's salary? why, that's more than $5,000. and $5,000 would mean a great deal to you... and your wife. it certainly would. it would mean that she could have her operation. i hope you will consider me for this assignment, sir. excellent. i rather thought you would, mr. crabtree. i want you to kill a man for me. i? you don't mean... this must be a joke. isn't it? you will recall, i think, that i have already told you i never learnt to make jokes. and certainly not pointless ones. no, mr. crabtree, i mean exactly what i said. you are to kill a man for me. but that's murder. i couldn't. i am absolutely incapable of such an act. are you, really? i was led to believe that had you not been restrained... you would have murdered the personnel manager for stowe and baker. but that was different. i lost control of myself for the moment. i envy you, mr. crabtree. i deeply envy you. you have emotions. i am entirely devoid of feeling. then why don't you kill this man yourself? that's a reasonable question and it deserves an answer. let me explain. some years ago, i married a woman... whose first husband we both believed to be dead. unfortunately, we were wrong. for the past five years, i have bought his silence for a monthly sum... that would stagger your imagination. he's blackmailing you? you could report this to the police. that would only result in having... my wife revealed as a bigamist and destroy the lives of our children. the scandal would ruin us. no, mr. crabtree, this man must be eliminated by someone... not even remotely connected to him. obviously, that cannot be me. but there must be people you can hire, gangsters or someone like that? and exchange one blackmailer for another? that's hardly a solution. but you have no guarantee that i won't blackmail you... or, better than that, go to the police. right now, i mean. if i told them the proposition you gave me- my dear mr. crabtree, what could you possibly tell them? you don't know who i am or where i come from. as far as you're concerned, i don't even exist. but the advertisement you put in the paper. anonymously. it's true that box 111 could be traced to me, but i fail to see any connection. any connection? you hired me. i wrote a letter of application. did you, mr. crabtree? yes. then you were informed by letter that the position had already been filled. a copy of my reply is in my files, in case the matter should come up. but this office, the furnishings, the magazine subscriptions... you paid for them. by mail. in your name. in cash. and if you're thinking of miss brown as a witness, she was never my secretary. like myself, she never really existed. but the reports... i have one here that's almost finished. there it is. to be sure, the reports. a completely useless jumble of words which for some unknown reason... you persisted in sending to me despite my letter that i had no use for this service. visualize the scene if you will, mr. crabtree. you go to the authorities. you tell them your incredible story. as proof, you have your pathetic little reports and nothing else. why, you'd be fortunate not to be committed... to an institution for the mentally deranged. that would be preferable to being hanged for murder. come now, mr. crabtree. you should realize by now that i wouldn't be that inept. i have made such careful preparations that... there isn't the slightest possibility of your arrest. let me explain. i don't want to hear it. you will notice that this office, chosen after much searching... is so small, so narrow that anyone not sitting behind the desk... must necessarily stand where i am now. directly behind me is the window overlooking the street... 20 stories below. one hard shove and it will be over. you make it sound so easy. i assure you it will be. the gentleman in question will be in the office first thing tomorrow morning. he will request a contribution to a good cause. you will take this envelope from the drawer and hand it to him. he's a methodical man. not once in the past 18 months... has he bothered to open the envelope on receiving it. he will put it in his inside coat pocket. at that precise moment, mr. crabtree, you will shove him out. then you close the window and go back to your reports. but the police are certain to come here. of course. and they will draw the only possible conclusion: the unfortunate man leaped from the roof above you. they will know it's suicide because that envelope you hand him... will contain not money, mr. crabtree... but a typed note explaining why he took his own life. you have until tomorrow morning to decide. if you carry out this assignment, i shall mail the money to your home. if you do not... you will never see or hear of me again. of course, your salary will automatically cease. for your wife's sake, mr. crabtree, i think you'll have to do it. come to bed, dear. it's nearly 3:00. huh? yes, dear, in a moment. you need your rest. you won't be any good at the office tomorrow. laura, how did you feel today? i'm feeling a little better every day. dr. foley is coming tomorrow. do you think i should ask him when i ought to go to the hospital? dear? yes, laura? what do you think? i think you might ask him. come in. come in. mr. crabtree? yes. i was hoping you'd like to make a contribution. yes, i have it ready for you. that's mighty good of you, mr. crabtree. i'd like to tell you... don't tell me anything! just get out of here, quickly, before i... it's parasites like you who should be exterminated. now, look here. do you have any idea of what you've done? you've taken away my job. i was out of work for a year, one whole year... through no fault of my own because of a stupid little man who... now you're ruining me and my wife. she'll be an invalid as long as she lives. somebody ought to have the nerve to... i wish i could, i'd kill you. hello. but i didn't. it was a... you don't understand. i'm not concerned with your rationalizations, mr. crabtree. you've completed the assignment. that's all that interests me. your year's salary is in the mail. you'll never hear from me again. congratulations and goodbye. detective grant. i'd like to talk to you for a minute, if we can. yes. there's been an accident. a man fell from this building and was killed. have you been in all morning? i always get here at 9:00. i haven't left this office. the door was closed, i suppose. yes, i never leave it open. and you didn't see anybody go up the stairs across the hall? no. must have fallen right past this window. you didn't see it? i was working. i'm closing out the office. i very seldom look at the window, anyway. it's closed, you probably wouldn't hear anything. well, i guess that's all. was it suicide? all the way. he had a suicide note in his pocket. sorry we bothered you. that's quite all right. mr. crabtree? are you a reporter? uh-uh. i came to pick up a contribution from a mutual friend. i don't think i have to mention any names. well, what about it? where's the money i was to pick up? the wrong man got it. you came too late. only it wasn't money. it was your suicide note. suicide? look here, i'd like to know what's going on. that's something you'll have to take up with the man you're blackmailing. and if he asks for me, tell him i no longer work here. as far as he is concerned, i never existed. a brilliant play. sneaky, but brilliant. and now, please keep your eyes on this space. for i shall return here next week... to bring you another story. good night."

""i want to suck-"" hello, kiddies. you caught me in the middle of my homework. your old pal, the crypt keeper, is a real believer in continuing... deaducation. which brings us to tonight's murderous morsel. it's a juicy little tale about a real bloodsucker... who never learned to go for the jugular. i call this plasma play... the reluctant vampire. oh, god. how i hate mondays. leopold? come on, leopold. leopold? now, while most of us make a point ofnot looking for trouble... my next guest has made a career ofit. he has a job that's definitely not for the squeamish. for the past 50 years, rupert van helsing has been hunting vampires. hunting vampires? mr. van helsing, is that for real? of course it's for real, miss jones. i assure you, vampires are quite real. and they really turn into bats and fly around? no. that's just in the movies, but they must drink blood to stay alive. and it must be human blood. it is for them an addiction. an addiction for which they ha ve to kill nightly. i don't know about you, but i'm wearing an extra scarf to bed tonight. hilarious. come on, leopold. come on. we've got to go to work. come on. good boy. i don't want excuses. i want answers! our blood supply is at a record low. we are tottering on the brink of bankruptcy. and all you can say is, ""there are irregularities in the bookkeeping. "" we've been meeting all our donation quotas, mr. crosswhite. what's happening, sally? is blood evaporating? i wanna know why there's not as much blood available as we're taking in. i don't know why. you better find out why, sweetheart... or your little butt's gonna be out on the sidewalk. oh, no. mr. crosswhite, i need this job. honey, you're dead weight on a sinking ship. please, mr. crosswhite, i'll get to the bottom of it. it's interesting that you put it that way, sally... because i'd like to keep you on here. you see, i like you, sally, a lot. and perhaps we could get to the bottom of that? - mr. crosswhite- - leave her alone. sir. nice try, hero. but before you go sticking your nose in anywhere... remember you're just a night watchman. - if you want to stay night watchman... - yes, sir. think about what i said, sweetheart. it's an awfully cruel world out there in the unemployment line. maybe you both better think about it. well, then. i'll be going now. oh, yes. goodbye, then. don't worry. i'm sure everything will turn out just fine. thanks for standing up for me today, mr. longtooth. - it was nothing. - no, i mean it. it was a brave thing to do. - nobody's ever called me that before. - what? brave. when my family used to go out hunting, i used to stay in the house. i couldn't kill anyone. anything. that doesn't mean you're a coward. you're sensitive, that's all. - i am? - yeah. and i think sensitive is... sexy. you do? sally, i've got to go now... 'cause i'm supposed to be watching things. would you like some company for a while? - is everything all right? - yes. just got a little toothache. well. guess i better let you go. good night, mr. longtooth. good night. lovely. over the lips, over the fangs, say goodbye to hunger pangs! yes, lovely. oh, yes. leopold, my dear friend, up you go. yes. oh, good. yes. a little ab or a little type o twist oflime and away we go yes. oh, nectar of the gods. here's blood in your eye, leopold. i think we'd better go and alter that record book, don't you?

you're early. it's not even light outside yet. i was worried about the blood. well, that's nothing to worry about. i'm sure there's more than enough for everyone. mr. longtooth... is there something wrong with me? what do you mean? do you think i'm unattractive? no. no. not at all. quite the contrary... i think you're very beautiful. then is there something wrong with you? what do you mean? don't you know? sally, i... i have to... i have to go. i'll see you tomorrow. this is a weird one all right. what kind of a sicko would drain all the blood out of some nickel-and-dime bum? i've got nothing to go on here. i got no fingerprints. i got no murder weapon. the only eyewitness to the whole thing is some... little old lady who says she kicked him in the balls. perhaps i can help you. who the hell are you? rupert van helsing. - what do you want, rupert? - i want to help you, lieutenant. though, at first, you're not going to believe anything i tell you. you're going to think i'm strange... bizarre. but in three to four days, when the city is awash in blood... you're going to beg me for my help. well, so far you're right on the money, rupert. you are strange... and i don't believe you, but thank you anyway. - goodbye. - any similarities? wait a minute, now. you're the guy on the radio, right? - the dracula chaser? - lieutenant... i assure you, i can prove everything i'm telling you. well, how are you gonna do that, rupert? perhaps, if i might see the body. just as i thought. a puncture mark directly above the jugular. yeah, but there's only one of them there, rupert. shouldn't there be two? perhaps one of his teeth is decayed. of course. why didn't i think of that? now, let me ask you something else. this guy was empty. not a drop of blood in him. that's nine whole pints. how do you explain that? - do vampires usually drink that much? - perhaps, if they're quite large. so we're looking for a 300-pound refugee from castle dracula... with bad teeth and a taste for muggers. is that it? - that's what we're looking for, lieutenant. - good. okay, you let me know when you find him, sherlock. and meantime, i'm due back in the 20th century. i'm afraid i have some bad news. due to the problems we've been having in maintaining our blood supply... i've decided to scale back. now, what this means is... most of you will no longer be with us at the end of the month. sorry, i know how you all must feel... but for us to continue current operations... there would have to be a stunning improvement in our business. i'm talking, at least twice our current daily intake. goodnight, everyone. we'll see you all in the morning. - mr. crosswhite. - yes, sally. please, mr. crosswhite, don't do this to us. - we need our jobs. - you do? sally, i don't know about the others... but perhaps you and i could come... to some sort of arrangement? sally? what are you staring at? thought much about your job prospects lately? my whole life, leo, has been killing, killing, more killing. hundreds of years of sucking blood. until, of course, i got a job in this marvelous place. i know, leo. i know. i am what i am. i just don't want to go back to the stalking life. i don't want to end up sucking on the streets again. maybe i could go out tonight. just one more little kill. come on, leo, we're not talking orphans and nuns here. we're talking about the dregs of society. i could really make a difference in this town. i could save the blood bank and take a bite out of crime. sweet and pure. just like nature intended. this is unbelievable, 500 pints in two days. we are back in business. this is a bill of lading from an international transport company. i've been up all night. fourteen straight hours on this goddamn murder spree. now, i'm gonna go home, i'm gonna have a little breakfast- read it.

[rumbling] - what's that? - maybe we just made love. [clacking] amy: the buggalo are in the crater! the rustlers must have seen me and ran! - oh, kif. you're so brave! - sh. they'll hear us. okay, the dynamite's in place. there's no other way to do it? only if your parents have thousands of helicopters. - actually... - too late! this is more fun! kif, you did it! how did you know dynamite would work? i took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune. the principle is essentially the same. [humming] hey, it's that ""barbecue's over"" sound again! leela: sandstorm! [screaming] - we're in the eye of the storm! - where? [buzzing] what's that? - oh, my gosh! - who are they? we are the native martians. [gasping] i didn't know buggalo could fly. those who revere mother mars can fly them. only they shall have buggalo. they're us. but your martian-ness, these buggalo aren't yours. they belong to the wong family. you mean family that took all land and gave us a lousy bead? uh-huh. amy wong. and you are? mad at wong family! we plan to ruin them by stealing buggalo. but now we take girl instead. wait! i'm too rich to be kidnapped! amy! no! don't worry, kif. i'm sure some other beautiful rich girl will fall in love with you. hooray! you bring back cattle! yes. but i'm afraid i've got some bad news as well. let amy tell us. that way it soften the blow. why amy being so quiet? well... that is... [humming] mr. wong: oh, no! martians kidnap amy! mr. wong: it them. they no use good grammar. - i'll get your daughter back. - forget it, squishy. you lose her. you done enough. this time we get most decorated lawman in the whole universe! you mean...? oh, no, please, i beg you. for the... i am the man with no name. zapp brannigan, at your service. please, we need you go get our daughter back! i'll clean up kif's mess. i shall go bargain with the martians personally. - your gasps intrigue me. - martians have no land. they been encouraged to live on reservation underground. no one ever dare go there. this mission is very dangerous! someone's sure to be killed! - fry? leela? bender? - damn you, old man! aw, look. betsy followed you, kif. i didn't realize you were bringing your girlfriend, lieutenant. she won't leave me alone. did i say girlfriend? she sounds more like a wife. zapp: behold! the stone face of mars! fry: hm. - the only entrance to the reservation. - what about the great stone ass? but it's on the other side of the planet. noseward, ho! [mumbling] [door opens] i am singing wind. chief of the martian tribe. take me to your leader. moving along. why you trespass on our land? to negotiate amy wong's release. and just to clarify, land is the stuff that has sky over it. - they have respect for the planet. - cynthia used to drink slurm. we'll give girl when we get planet surface. - how do we know she's alive? - i'm fine. sh. don't weaken our bargaining power. what if you give her up... ...and we carve presidents in your mountain? you waste words. we want land that was taken from us. actually, you traded it for a bead. tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse. we want land! my people are people of law. and that law is: no backsies. the time for stupid statements is over.

[humming stops] fry: yeah, kif! bender: all right! kroker, that was one brannigan-esque feat of heroism. we misjudged you, green one. you fly the buggalo like us. you have reverence for mother mars. - let there be peace between us. - yes. let us smoke-em peace pipe. smoke-em? here, take. no thanks. i'm on the peace patch. you must smoke peace pipe, peacefully. or we'll kill you. well, it's just really that i don't feel... don't be a chicken. teenagers all smoke, and they seem pretty on the ball. - yeah! - way to suck it! hey, i'm smoking! i'm the greatest! oh, monkey trumpets! you coughed at our offer of peace, so you must die. the bead used to crush our dreams shall be used to crush your bones. i don't have bones. i'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that... ah! oh, oh, oh my. oh. fry: that's the bead you traded your land for? it's a huge diamond! it must be worth a fortune! really? [mutters] oh, chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world! if you want your land, we could trade back for it. hm. we assumed our ancestors were cheated... ...because they not have concept of ownership. - so we can have the diamond? - no. we do have concept of ownership. you can go. sorry about the rustling and kidnapping. - and your sacred land? - land, schmand! we don't want to live here. it's a dump. we'll buy new planet and act like it's sacred. who's gonna argue? nobody, that's who! kif flew betsy, rescued me, and made peace with the martians. he too much of a wimp. yeah. i'm sure it was all mr. zapp brannigan here. please, you give me too little credit. captain brannigan, you're always welcome at rancho zoidberg. [yells] money doesn't make good people! no, sir! thanks for saving my life, kif. you're my hero. oh, you're kind. but your parents still don't like me. well, gloviously. but if they liked you, then i wouldn't. don't you know anything about girls?

1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"l found 27 voles in his storeroom. vole infestations are common on this station. ask chief o'brien. he and morn were painting numbers on the voles' backs. we were just... counting them to see how many we'd caught. - you were preparing a vole fight. - a vole fight? l'm appalled. do you really think that was what morn was up to? l want the voles confiscated and removed from the station. you can't confiscate morn's voles. they're like his pets. l'll see if l can get him some goldfish. now gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, it's late. poor morn. this is going to break his hearts. huh. ops is yours, lieutenant. going somewhere, chief? sir, l need to talk to you. - lt's kind of private. - we were just leaving. come on, let's go break the news to morn. - do you want to talk in my office? - actually, let's go to my place. - commander! - stand down. get on the transporter pad. move! computer, energise on my command. energise. where are we? you could say we just stepped through the looking glass. sit down. make yourself comfortable. right now l'm not feeling very comfortable. there. that's better. - nice move. - glad you liked it. lt doesn't change anything. you can't go home because l won't reconfigure the transporter. you must have a lot of questions. not as many as you think. - you know where we are? - lf l had to guess, l'd say this is the parallel universe we visited a year ago. ah. you're quick. just like our sisko. that saves me giving you a history lesson. but l'd better update you on current events. since your officers left, we've rebelled against the klingon-cardassian alliance. - we're fighting for our lives. - l wish you luck. but what has that got to do with me? everything. you were the leader of the terran rebellion. - at least, our benjamin sisko was. - was? captain sisko's dead. the cardassians blew up his ship. so you want me to take his place. like l said, you're quick. l've got a better idea. you're going to send me home with the transporter pad. wait. hear me out. l'm not asking for a lifetime commitment. all l need is for you to finish sisko's mission. you'll have to find someone else. l don't belong here. l won't interfere with this universe. at least let me tell you about the mission. then if you decide not to help, l'll send you home. there's a terran scientist working for the alliance. our sources say she's completing a new transpectral sensor array that will allow the alliance to locate us in the badlands. without a place to hide, the alliance can track us down and kill us all. so you want me to prevent this scientist from finishing her project? sisko was sure he could change her mind, get her to work for us. - how did he plan to do that? - she was his wife. jennifer. you know her? she was my wife too. but in my universe, she's dead. not here she isn't. not yet, anyway. what do you mean ''not yet''? unless you can persuade professor sisko to join our cause, - we'll have no choice but to kill her. - kill her? we can't let her finish the sensor array. lt'd mean the end of the rebellion. l can't let her die. not again. you're the only one who can save her. delectable. and so are you. enter. mr garak said you wanted to see me. yes. come. join us. lf you're wondering when the sensor array will be finished, the answer is... as soon as possible, l know. will that be all? l have to get back to work. l have news of your husband. nothing you could tell me about ben would interest me. - l haven't even seen him in five years. - l know that. and l hope that will make this easier for you. you see... benjamin is dead. can l go now? you must have loved him very much to be so angry with him. to have become so cold. - were other terrans killed with him? - a whole ship full. all this killing has to stop. and it will. as soon as you complete your transpectral sensors, we'll be able to locate the rebel bases, disarm them and put an end to all this bloodshed. and l will be able to resume pressing the alliance to become more reasonable to its terran population. you do believe me, don't you? l get jennifer away from the alliance, then you send me home. you get us jennifer and you can have anything you want. convince her to leave terok nor. why is she helping the alliance? didn't she know sisko was leading the rebellion? she knew all right. she and captain sisko didn't get along too well. the captain didn't get along with anyone. ln some ways, the rebellion's better off without him. the captain knew how to fight, but that's about all he knew. - ready? - you don't look very confident, chief. call me smiley. that's what the captain called me. all right, smiley. l wish we had more time to get you ready. l haven't told you half of what you need to know. l hope you don't get too many surprises. lf l do, l guess l'll just have to... improvise. l told sisko he'd never get close to terok nor, and l was right. l say we teach the alliance a lesson. throw all we have at terok nor and rip it to pieces. l disagree. following your suggestion wouldn't help and would result in a loss of life. easy to say. those cardassian pigs didn't kill your brother. we've all suffered losses. logic dictates caution in the face of a superior enemy. logic won't win us our freedom. we have to take action. and we will. - but this time we do it my way. - what do you propose we do? we smuggle explosives on the station, plant them there and detonate them. lt's unlikely that anyone assigned to such a mission would survive. l say it's worth the risk. does that mean you're volunteering for the job? - captain, you're alive. - of course. you can't kill the captain. he's too ornery. l hope that doesn't disappoint anyone. we're glad you're all right. l'm sure you are. we heard your fighter was destroyed. the alliance said you were dead. just their propaganda machine working overtime. but you know what all that tells me? they're scared. and we're going to give them plenty of reasons to stay scared. well, well, well, it's about time you came back. that's to let you know l missed you. and that's for letting me think you were dead. - glad to see you still care. - you coming or not? - l thought you told me l was married. - you are...technically. - she's your mistress. - l see what you meant by surprises. l'm really glad you're alive. and l'm going to make you glad you're alive. we have a lot of planning to do. lt can wait. l suppose it can at that. these reports are unacceptable. productivity in the ore processing centre is down. you've got to do better. are you trying to make me look bad to sector command? not at all. l've done all l could to motivate the workers. - such as? - bribes...torture... l've authorised the overseers to execute those not meeting the quota. l'm sure that pleases them, but it's not getting the job done. follow me. let's start with... him, him, and her. - and do what? - execute them. random and unprovoked executions will keep them alert and motivated. l bow to your brilliance. go. you too. though l hope your mood improves before we run out of workers. what does my mood have to do with anything? lf you don't mind my saying, l have noticed your ill humour lately. l don't know what you're talking about. lt began about the time you learned of captain sisko's death. why would l be upset by such delightful news? l was under the impression that you were rather fond of him. - then you were mistaken. - l will say this for him. he did have spirit. too much spirit can be a dangerous thing. lt tends to infect others. that's something we won't have to worry about at least. with sisko's death and the completion of the sensor array, the rebellion is certain to collapse. - you seem very sure of yourself. - l am. l'll remember that. lf the rebellion continues, l'll know who to blame. are you sure these patrol patterns are accurate? you tell me. you gathered the information. hm? - that's right. - are you ok? you seem distracted. - just thinking. - l've been thinking too. we've been fighting against the alliance for almost a year now. and what has it gotten us? nothing. we were better off collecting tributes for the lntendant. - those days are gone. - maybe, but l'm tired of living like this. the rebellion's a lost cause and we both know it. don't you want to free the terrans? have you taken a look at your troops? they're ex-slaves with delusions of grandeur. they'll never overthrow the alliance. let's get a ship and go. forget all about the rebellion. l'm not ready to give up just yet. you won't have much choice. once that witch you married finishes the sensor array, alliance ships will be all over these badlands. we'll have no place to hide. then l guess we have to make sure she doesn't finish. trying to reach terok nor using small fighters didn't work. but we need to get jennifer off that station and soon. we've been meaning to talk to you about that. mr bashir is not convinced that you can persuade her to join our cause. l can be very persuasive. l don't even know why we're bothering to discuss this. your ship was destroyed before you even got close to terok nor. hit him. that's what the captain would do. go on, hit him. let's face it, captain, the woman hates you. what my wife thinks of me is none of your concern. anyone else want to disagree with the captain? put it away, dax. go on, put it away. no one is questioning your authority, captain. but we have to stop her before she finishes the sensor array. and there's only one way to do that. - we have to kill her. - you've been saying that all along. well, maybe it's time he listened. killing her would be a lot easier than rescuing her. easier...but not smarter. lf she's so important to the alliance, think how important she'd be to us. - we could use a scientist on our side. - you tell them, smiley. - at least someone is using his brain. - think about it. who knows what other weapons the alliance is developing? professor sisko could counteract anything they come up with. she's valuable. we need her. all right. does anyone disagree? good. now let's get to work. tell the lntendant what you told me. - lt's about captain sisko. - sisko? he's alive. he got off his ship before it exploded. - l suppose it's possible. - lt's more than possible. lt's true. but l can tell you how to get your hands on him. lf you're interested. don't do that. l can't help it. lt itches. - l hope this works. - lt'll work. just stop scratching. you did pretty good back there. l don't think anyone suspected you weren't captain sisko. at least not once you hit bashir. we both know that was just a warm up. - jennifer's the one l have to convince. - seeing her won't be easy for you. - when did your wife die? - five years ago. well just remember... jennifer may look like her, but she's not. she's a different person. l'll try to remember that. do you know what went wrong between her and sisko? they never should have been together in the first place. she came from one of the few privileged terran families, people who cooperated with the alliance. the captain fought his way up from the mines. - what's she like, this jennifer? - l don't know. they had separated by the time l got to know the captain. what was your jennifer like? she was the kindest, most caring person l ever knew. l wouldn't get my hopes up. hold on. l'm reading a slight energy distortion in subspace. - what are the coordinates? - lt's coming from all around us. captain sisko would try to fight his way out of this. be glad l'm not him. well, if it isn't the notorious captain sisko and his friend the tinkerer. l'm glad to see you too, lntendant. - still the same old benjamin. - you wouldn't have it any other way. - perhaps, but l'm still going to kill you. - maybe, but not right away. - you flatter yourself. - not unjustly, l hope. lntendant, let me teach him some manners. all in good time. but first... whatever shall we do about o'brien? l remember the first time l saw you. you were fixing something. you were always fixing things, making things better. and everyone loved you for it. even me. but that wasn't enough, was it? you couldn't be happy here. you had to lash out and betray everyone who was ever good to you. why? - l wanted to be free. - free? you're a terran. you were born a slave. you'll die a slave. take him to ore processing. remind him where he belongs. - what about sisko? - take me to the lntendant's quarters. she'll decide what to do with me. - of all the impudent... - do as he says. lntendant, l demand that this man be... you... demand? you promised me he'd die. and he will... when l say, and not a moment before. - shall we? - after you. l really don't know what to do with you. l sympathise. lt's a difficult decision. but l'm sure you'll come up with something. my only reason to keep you alive is to infuriate garak. what better reason do you need? well, suppose...l let you live. - what will l get in return? - what do you want? your loyalty. that's all l've ever wanted. for you to be at my side, my strong right arm. but l'm afraid l can never trust you again. which means... that l will have to dispose of you eventually. the question is, should it be sooner, or later? - do l get a vote? - of course you do. lt just doesn't count. no, l've got to think about this. you will let me know what you decide? l wouldn't dream of keeping it a secret. - jennifer. - hello, ben. please leave us. - and miss this touching reunion? - you heard her. lf you need anyone to beat him into submission, don't hesitate to call me. all right. l'm here. - why did you want to see me? - l was hoping we could talk. really? you never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. - l made a lot of mistakes back then. - save the apologies, ben. they're not going to work. you are, without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical... - you've made your point. - l doubt it. you never listened before. you were too busy trying to impress every woman. - were there really that many? - there were enough. and if it wasn't women, it was that ship of yours. sometimes l think it was the only thing you ever loved. maybe l loved you both. then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the lntendant? that's a good question. now this rebellion of yours. do you know how many deaths you've caused? how much destruction? l'm fighting to help free our people. you're fighting because you like to fight. you've given the alliance an excuse to treat the terrans worse than before. l hope that with your capture, the rebellion can be ended peacefully. - who said l'd been captured? - l suppose you came just to see me? actually, l came here to rescue you. rescue me? l'm not going anywhere with you. - you can't stay here. - l have a job to finish. - the sensor array? - that's right. lf you finish it, you'll destroy our hope for a better future. - l don't think you want that. - l just want to end this fighting. to force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement. lt's not that simple. the alliance isn't interested in a peaceful settlement. - lf we lay down arms, we'll be killed. - the rebellion kills people every day. - lt has to stop. - not this way. not while the terrans are still at the mercy of the alliance. - they're your own people. - don't talk to me like that. since when do you care about our people? you've never cared about anyone but yourself. maybe l've changed in the past few years. how many times have l heard you say that? l guess l was a pretty lousy husband. you guess? - l know it's too late for an apology. - you're right. but for what it's worth, l'm sorry. what is it? for a second, l almost believed you. you know what l wish? l wish l'd never met you. l wish things could have been better between us. but this isn't about us. or is it? why are you working for the alliance? do you believe in it or is it something else? l don't know what you're talking about. l think the two of us have been fighting each other so long that you've gotten used to us being on opposite sides. but l'm not the enemy this time. the alliance is. the alliance is your enemy, not mine. that's where you're wrong. don't you see? you're no different than the slaves working here. you may even be worse off. they know they're prisoners. - what if l am a prisoner? - you don't have to be. fight back. come with me. you want me to join the rebellion? the way l see it... freedom is a lot better than slavery. think about it. took him long enough. - what are you doing? - sending a message. - you've a subdermal communicator? - courtesy of the ferengi. jennifer, l need an answer. are you coming with me or not? - do l have a choice? - of course you do. you can go back to your quarters and forget we ever spoke. lt's up to you. - all right. but let's get one thing clear. - what's that? - l still hate you. - l know. terran, what are you doing? re-routing the central odn processor. the lntendant's orders. l don't recall receiving clearance for any repairs. you don't say? hey! anyone who wants to get out of here, follow me. come on. - where are we going? - airlock 7. a ship should be there. providing we get there before the security systems reactivate. get back! - now what? - l'll think of something. - good work, smiley. - there's 30 more of them behind us. - we'd better get to the airlock. - come on. something tells me that's not part of your plan. we'd better find another way out of here. got any suggestions? fall back. lt was very clever having one of yours betray you so you could get aboard. l was completely fooled. fortunately, mr garak is somewhat more cynical. your ferengi friend informed us of your plan...with a little persuasion. l'm afraid there's no escape. your ship's locked down, your pilot's dead. there's no way out. you might as well surrender. - lf we surrender, she'll kill us. - maybe us... but not jennifer. what if we offer her a trade? l stay here and she lets you live. benjamin, you know how l hate to be kept waiting. l came a long way to get you out. l'm not leaving without you. - what is it? - nothing. - how far is ore processing? - only a couple of levels. time's up, benjamin. benjamin! pursue! - he always has to make things difficult. - lt's one of his least endearing qualities. - smiley, seal the doors. - sure. lt's easy for you to say. - l will get you out of here, l promise. - l believe you. there's no way out of this room except through that door. don't worry. l know what l'm doing. l just hope your terok nor had the same cardassian designer as mine. are you sure they're in there? good. then we've got them. use the manual override to open the doors. this time, l trust you won't be so lenient with mr sisko. don't worry. he has disappointed me for the last time. jennifer... l was so worried about you. but you're safe now. ln fact, l can assure you... that your husband will never annoy you again. actually, for the first time since l've met him, he's not annoying me. ln fact, he's making a lot of sense. he can be very persuasive when he wants to be. l suppose this means you won't be finishing the sensor array. l'm a terran. keep her alive. kill the others. l wouldn't. you'd be making a mistake. my only mistake was not executing you in the first place. you don't know how right you are. l've activated the self-destruct sequence. unless l disarm it, this whole place will blow up in nine minutes. that's impossible. there's no way you could know the command access code. alpha 91 75 blue. computer, disengage self-destruct sequence. authorisation kira. alpha 91 75 blue. authorisation denied. l changed it. you have 8 minutes and 30 seconds to let us go. - otherwise we all die. - don't listen to him. he's bluffing. - he's not. - how do you know? l know. give me the new access code, and l'll let you go. l will give you the access code once my friends and l are safely away. do we have a deal? this isn't over, benjamin. l'll hunt you down. l swear it. you're welcome to try. l'm glad to see you're getting along. we have a lot in common. he's all yours. dax tells me you're leaving. l thought l'd pay the romulans a visit. see if l can convince them to help us. then l guess this is goodbye. there's so much l want to tell you, l just don't know where to start. why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? - he's dead, isn't he? - l'm sorry. don't be. who are you? really? lt's a long story. but ask smiley. he can fill you in on the details. - he seems like a good man. - he does at that. so what are you going to do now? l'm sure smiley will find something to keep me busy. you're not really going to visit the romulans, are you? the deal was that l get you off the station, and then l go home. - will l see you again? - l don't know. thank you for rescuing me. lt was my pleasure. ready, captain? you'd better go. take me home, smiley."
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"naomi wildman, state your purpose here. l was waiting for you. kadis- kot, remember? our weekly game? reschedule for tomorrow. l'm working now. redecorating isn't work. aesthetics are irrelevant. l'm modifying the alcove to function as a cortical processing subunit. that was my next guess. then l won't need to explain its purpose. okay, you win. what do you do with the cortical processing, uh... subunit. on borg vessels, there's one in each unimatrix. lt downloads newly assimilated data to the drones. but voyager isn't a borg vessel, and you're not a drone anymore. voyager collects a great deal of information- - sensor scans, navigational projections, engineering updates, away team reports, scientific analyses. the results of our kadis- kot tournament? that, too. the crew must read and study this information- - an inefficient procedure. these data nodes are downloading the information into the alcove. which is going to download it into you. precisely. ln a matter of hours, l will assimilate several months worth of data. can l try it sometime? your physiology is... different from mine. guess l'll stick to reading my lessons and listening to neelix tell stories. l will see you tomorrow. can l watch? okay, tomorrow. warning. plate is hot. now you tell me. you go for authenticity and what do you get? second- degree burns. l've been slaving over that replicator program for hours. what was this bizarre rumor l heard about half the crew on deck 5 getting pregnant? oh, that. the doctor was running generational projections on the sick bay computer. tom paris happened to glance at the monitor and jumped to conclusions. wasn't long before neelix was asking me if he could turn cargo bay 1 into a nursery. word travels fast on this ship, hmm? warp 10. oh, by the way, l meant to tell you... there's a class- k nebula 25 light- years off starboard. we should take a look. a major detour for a minor nebula. we are explorers, remember? permission granted. main course, a recipe l've never tried. but we are explorers, remember? regeneration cycle complete. seven of nine to lieutenant torres. lieutenant torres, respond. good morning, seven. this better be important. l must speak with you at once. l'm picking up some interesting graviton fluctuations about ten light- years away. can you be more specific? not at this distance. tom... alter course. l want to take a closer look. chakotay had his heart set on that nebula we're headed for. he'll have to wait. captain, l need permission to shut down the sensor grid. seven thinks a couple of insects are disrupting the power flow. a mating pair of photonic fleas, to be more accurate and possibly their offspring. and how did you arrive at this theory? last night, l downloaded six months of ship status reports into my new cortical subunit while l was regenerating. learn while you sleep. l tried that once- -  gave me a headache. go on. eight weeks ago, an away team encountered a kartelan freighter carrying supplies from sector 492, a territory that included a former talaxian colony. mr. neelix used the opportunity to acquire 12 kilograms of amber spice- - a delicacy among his people. what does that have to do with the sensor grid? on the same day, ensign kim was repairing a replicator in the mess hall. l remember that- -  neelix told me to stick around to try something he was cooking. no doubt made with the amber spice, which contained the larvae of the photonic fleas. how could you possibly know that? because l also downloaded data regarding their life cycles. the larvae flew out of the spice jar in search of their primary source of nourishment- - plasma particles. the conduits within the nearby sensor grid contain an unlimited supply of these particles. ensign kim had unwittingly given the creatures access by exposing the grid. the now mature creatures periodically tap into the conduit for nourishment. when they do, the sensor emitters momentarily lose their resolution. a logical, though highly speculative, analysis. let's find a more suitable home for them. l'm picking up graviton fluctuations. take us out of warp. on screen. anybody want to hazard a guess? they are hailing us. on screen. l recommend maximum shielding. there are a few technical issues l haven't worked out yet. there's a massive graviton surge coming from that thing. shields to full. your apparatus appears to be destabilizing. lf l don't find a way to repair this power core, they'll be able to see the explosion all the way to, uh... where did you say you were from? l didn't... but we're from a planet called earth. all the way to... earth. can we ask you what it's supposed to do? catapult a vessel across space in the time it takes to say ''catapult a vessel across space.'' lt'll make warp drive look like a wooden sled. maybe we can help you with that power core. hmm? the core sends a graviton surge through the projectors which locks onto a ship and sends it hurtling into null space to emerge a few hours later, hundreds if not thousands of light- years away. l'm curious why you built this catapult. simple- - l've been looking for a way to get home. we know the feeling. l'd been exploring an unstable wormhole. before l knew it, l was here and my home planet was there. l was facing a journey of at least ten years. lnstead, l decided to build a catapult. have you tested it yet? two weeks ago, l sent a probe nearly 600 light- years, but it destabilized the core. l've been trying to fix it ever since. we can send an engineering team over to help you. no, no, it's too dangerous. l wouldn't send my own crew in there. then we could find a way to adjust the core reaction from here. a few well- timed graviton pulses from our deflector dish might do it. that's generous, but l have nothing to give in return. we're not asking for anything in return. you could use the catapult after l've made my jump. lt should still be functional. a thousand light- years won't exactly get you back to earth... but it would cut a few years off our trip. lf you're successful, and if l'm satisfied a jump would be safe for voyager, then we'll take you up on that offer. thank you. let's get started. come in. good morning. perhaps not. the alien, mr. tash, is trying to deceive us. his catapult is the same type of technology that was used to trap voyager in the delta quadrant five years ago. l scanned the catapult myself. sensors didn't pick up anything unusual. you spent the night in your new alcove. processing the same information and cross- referencing it with voyager's database. when the catapult destabilized yesterday, astrometric sensors recorded a momentary burst of epsilon radiation. unusual, but not unheard of. epsilon radiation is one the byproducts of a tetryon reactor. according to your own entries in the database, your only encounter with that kind of technology occurred five years ago in the alpha quadrant. a coherent tetryon beam locked onto voyager, and you were hit by a massive displacement wave, which pulled you across 70,000 light- years in a matter of minutes. the source of that tetryon beam was the caretaker's array. mr. tash claims that his catapult will be able to do something very similar. he didn't want us to send over a repair team. out of concern for our safety. lt's obvious he was trying to hide his tetryon reactor. the first time we met a caretaker, we were pulled halfway across the galaxy. the second time we were almost killed. l'm not eager for a third round. ls this any way to treat a colleague? not so much as a molecule of caretaker dna. thank you, doctor. there's a tetryon reactor powering your catapult. you didn't want us to find it, did you? unless you answer my questions, l'll resume course, and you can ask somebody else for help. look, l acquired the tetryon reactor at great cost. this territory is full of species who would do anything for such advanced technology, including steal it. l apologize for the deception, but you do understand. we made an agreement to cooperate. l see no reason not to continue. thank you, captain. keep me informed on your progress. that reactor had to come from somewhere. l can't just ignore the possibility of a caretaker nearby. keep scanning. see what you can find. there is another possibility. the reactor may have come from the same array that brought voyager to the delta quadrant. that's a long shot, seven. maybe not. again, according to your own reports, you believed the only way to keep the array from falling into the wrong hands was to destroy it. lt's possible the destruction was incomplete. and one of the reactors survived? we scanned for debris. there was nothing left but some fused pieces of metal alloy. l wish to reexamine the sensor records from that event. ln case we were mistaken. yes. go right ahead. computer, describe the debris remaining after the array was destroyed. particulate dust and metallic fragments composed of an unknown alloy, vapor composed of hydrogen, helium, mercury and argon. was there anything left of the tetryon reactor? negative. specify the yield of the tricobalt device. 20,000 teracochranes. who programmed the device? commander tuvok. display the detonation. advance the image by .01 seconds. again. lsolate grid 3- 7 and magnify. ls that a tractor beam? lnsufficient sensor data. ldentify its source. lnsufficient sensor data. ldentify the isolated section of the array. secondary power core. which contained a tetryon reactor. affirmative. commander, l've been reviewing the data on the destruction of the caretaker's array. unfortunately, the sensor records are incomplete. l don't doubt it. we were being attacked by the kazon. half the ship's systems were down. a single kazon vessel. armed to the teeth. commander, you fired the tricobalt charge that destroyed the array. correct. under the captain's orders? did you also program the charge? yes. under the captain's orders as well? not directly. l determined the yield. 20,000 teracochranes. that's correct. according to sensor estimates of the array's hull integrity, a charge of half that yield would have been sufficient. the captain wanted nothing left for the kazon to use. l calculated a yield certain to produce that result. something may have escaped the blast- - one of the tetryon reactors. but we scanned for debris. the charge you detonated tore an opening in subspace. and that's where the reactor went? yes. how? lt was pushed there by a tractor beam. do you have evidence of a tractor beam? perhaps. speculation is not evidence. there was no tractor beam, because there was no ship in the vicinity to generate one, unless you can prove otherwise. thank you, commander. looking for a midnight snack? l require information. l'm attempting to determine whether the catapult technology was derived from the caretaker's array. so l heard. a fascinating theory. lt's got my mind spinning. how long were you in the vicinity of the array before voyager arrived? about a year. kes was on a nearby planet and, uh, we were getting very close. did you ever encounter the caretaker directly? no, no, no, no, no, no. ln my opinion, any being powerful enough to grab ships from the other side of the galaxy should be avoided. according to voyager's database, he claimed he was searching for a genetically compatible mate. did you believe that explanation? l had no reason to doubt it, though it did seem a bit excessive. l mean, all those ships. what happened to them? well, after he sampled the crew's dna, he sent them back where they came from l suppose. you know, kes always thought something more was going on, but she had quite an imagination. were there any other ships in the area after voyager arrived? only the kazon. but the caretaker could have pulled in another vessel... a cloaked ship, perhaps. seven, what are you getting at? a third ship hidden from both voyager and the kazon. what was it doing there? preventing the tetryon reactor from being destroyed. kes was right. something was going on. voyager's sensor logs were damaged in the kazon attack. l can't be certain. maybe l can help. the sensor records off my ship weren't damaged. l can give them to you. the tetryon reaction is stable. graviton field is set for a 100 light- year jump. the catapult's locking on to him. we're being hailed. on screen. l'll contact you the moment l reenter normal space. thank you, captain. my pleasure. catapult is at full power. good- bye to you all. final launch sequence has been initiated. he's gone. how long before we can expect to hear from him? lf his vessel survived, one or two hours. seven of nine to commander chakotay. go ahead. l require your assistance in the astrometrics lab. on my way. computer, seal the doors. deactivate all sensors within this room. acknowledged. what's this about? l believe voyager's presence in the delta quadrant is no accident. you and the crew have been stranded here intentionally. by whom? captain janeway. the captain and tuvok were involved in a federation conspiracy. they're in collusion with the caretaker and possibly the cardassians. l see. and the point of this conspiracy? l believe they're attempting to establish a military presence in the delta quadrant. that's quite a theory. perhaps you haven't heard of the jankata accord. ''no species shall enter another quadrant for the purpose of territorial expansion.'' the federation signed it, the cardassians signed it, and captain janeway would be the last person to violate it. lmprobable as it may sound, l've found compelling evidence to support my theory. what kind of evidence? l've analyzed over 30 million teraquads of data regarding voyager's activities over the past five years. lt's quite clear that we've been the victim of an elaborate deception. l don't have the benefit of a cortical processor. why don't you give me the abridged version? ln the months before voyager's arrival, neelix recorded the appearance of 52 vessels, including this one. a cardassian warship. a remarkable coincidence. only days before voyager's arrival, the cardassians were already in the delta quadrant. the caretaker was trying to find a mate, remember? he was pulling ships from all over the galaxy. l'm familiar with the caretaker's actions. ln each instance, he would examine the crew's dna and when he failed to find a genetic match, he would release the vessel, but in this instance, neelix's sensors indicated the ship vanished. obviously, it was returned to the alpha quadrant. why? you seem to have all the answers. l believe the cardassians were sent back to deliver strategic information regarding the delta quadrant. conjecture. extrapolation. l can believe the cardassians might be involved in this, but not starfleet. there are precedents for unauthorized missions of this type, commander. according to the federation database, the maquis were victims of several of them. all right, you've got my attention. you said that tuvok and captain janeway were involved. tell me how. at the same time the cardassians were meeting with the caretaker, your maquis vessel was infiltrated with a starfleet agent. tuvok. your navigator. he guided your ship to prearranged coordinates in the badlands, where the caretaker locked onto you. once you were pulled into the delta quadrant tuvok could've secretly transmitted final instructions to the caretaker. a short time later, captain janeway guided voyager to the same coordinates and was also pulled into the delta quadrant. all of these events took place within a matter of days. l find that suspicious. l'll admit, the timing seems a little convenient, but that doesn't mean there was a master plan. why did the captain destroy the array? so the kazon couldn't use it to attack the ocampa. that's what she told the crew, but l believe she intended to remain in the delta quadrant all along. lf the array had remained intact, you and all the others would have insisted on using it to return home. she was keeping it from the kazon. the captain ordered commander tuvok to destroy the array. he fired two tricobalt devices. are those weapons normally carried on federation starships? no. yet they were part of voyager's arsenal. why? l can't explain that. l can. neither phasers nor torpedoes are capable of creating a tear in subspace. a tricobalt device is. as tuvok detonated the device, a cloaked ship locked on to one of the array's tetryon reactors and pushed it through the tear into subspace, protecting it from the blast, and hiding it from voyager's sensors... but the captain and tuvok knew exactly where it was going. once voyager left the area, the reactor was retrieved and began a similar journey carried by a series of vessels, until it was finally delivered to mr. tash. who used it to build the catapult. he was waiting here for voyager and for the final phase of the mission. which is what, exactly? l don't think captain janeway is planning to use the catapult to get voyager closer to home. l think she's going to use it to bring in more vessels from the alpha quadrant. lf l'm correct, this region of space will soon be occupied by a federation- cardassian invasion force. you've uncovered some interesting facts, but your interpretation is farfetched. these are random incidents. granted, some of them are hard to explain, but there's no conspiracy here. stardate 51008. captain janeway allows kes to leave voyager. neelix told me that kes had suspicions about the caretaker. was the captain trying to silence her? stardate 51462. the doctor's program is transmitted to a starfleet vessel on the outskirts of the alpha quadrant- - an attempt by the captain to contact earth, or a secret communiqué informing starfleet of her progress? stardate 50984. janeway forges an alliance with the borg. stardate 517 62. a cease- fire with the hirogen. stardate 52861. a non- aggression pact with the terkellian. she called each incident, ''diplomacy.'' l believe she was trying to establish a tactical infrastructure in the delta quadrant. over the past five years, captain janeway has altered course 263 times in the name of exploration. ln reality, she was mapping the region and collecting strategic data regarding... l get the point. you still doubt my suspicions, but can you be certain l'm wrong? absolutely certain? no. until you are, you mustn't allow captain janeway to retain control of the catapult. l'm picking up a transmission, heavily distorted. he made it. can you clear it up? success, captain- - 5,000 light- years. are you all right? a few systems overloaded- -  nothing serious. l had to readjust my shields during mid- flight- - almost lost my outer hull. l'm sending you the modifications. my catapult is yours, captain. good luck. get that data down to b'elanna. tell her to enhance our shields. so we're going ahead with the jump? l want to run a few more tests, launch some probes, but if it all checks out, l see no reason not to. l've received the telemetry. l'll take it to engineering. l want you to add a .03 variance to these shield modifications. that'll disrupt the emitters. and you'll need another six hours to get them back on line, l know. have you run this by the captain? no... and l'm not going to... not yet. she's pulling your leg. lt- it's got to be some kind of borg practical joke. she wasn't joking. a secret mission? starfleet in league with the caretaker? lt's ridiculous. ''ridiculous''? seven has some compelling evidence. well, then, let's go to the captain, get a straight answer. ''good morning, kathryn. ''all systems are operational. ''the crew's in good health. ''and by the way, is it true you've been lying to us for five years?'' l'm not prepared to make that accusation, but l can't ignore what l've heard, either. so, what do you suggest? l want you to delay those shield modifications. that'll give me time to check seven's database, take a look at the evidence myself. the captain asked me to work with you on the shields. that won't be necessary, ensign. oh, l don't mind. oh, you know how eager she is to make that jump. harry, we're fine here. ''too many cooks,'' harry. you know how it is. we'll let you know when we're done. download complete. seven of nine to captain janeway. go ahead. l need to speak with you in the astrometrics lab. l'm on my way. computer, seal the door and deactivate internal sensors to this room. acknowledged. seven? l believe chakotay and other members of your crew are involved in a conspiracy to resurrect the maquis rebellion. did chakotay put you up to this? voyager and the federation itself are in grave danger. go on. l've concluded that chakotay intends to use the catapult to launch attacks against cardassian and federation starships. chakotay gave up his allegiance to the maquis a long time ago. what you're saying makes no sense. lmprobable as it may sound, l found compelling evidence to support my theory. ln the months before voyager's arrival, neelix recorded the sudden appearance of 52 vessels... including this one. a cardassian warship. l've analyzed the hull geometry and warp signature. lt was one of the same ships that were pursuing chakotay and his crew in the region known as the badlands. lt was pulled into the delta quadrant by the caretaker during that engagement. according to federation records, that same cardassian warship was found destroyed in the badlands. the investigation revealed that it was attacked by the maquis. l believe that for some unknown reason the caretaker had sent this ship back to the alpha quadrant, and that commander chakotay attacked the vessel before it could reach its destination. he downloaded its computer core and discovered the presence of the caretaker's array. he realized that the array could be used by the maquis as a weapon to launch surprise attacks against cardassian and starfleet vessels. well, l commend you for your imagination, but tuvok was a spy on chakotay's ship. lf your theory were true, he would have known about it. he does. tuvok has been collaborating with the maquis resistance all along. that's not possible, seven. with tuvok's assistance, chakotay plotted a course toward the next likely appearance of the caretaker's displacement wave offering his vessel as bait. his ploy almost succeeded, but the caretaker was more powerful than he anticipated. his crew was taken captive. a few days later, voyager arrived and facilitated their escape. chakotay seized that opportunity to make one last attempt to gain control of the array, but, then, you gave the order to destroy it. circumstantial evidence- -  not proof. who carried out your order to destroy the array? tuvok. using what type of technology? tricobalt devices. he set the yield to 20,000 teracochranes. lt was enough to tear an opening in subspace. a cloaked ship locked on to one of the reactors, protecting it from the blast and hiding it from voyager's sensors. the reactor was retrieved and carried by a series of vessels, until it was delivered to mr. tash, who was well- compensated by chakotay to build the catapult. he was waiting here for voyager, so chakotay could complete the mission he was forced to abandon five years ago. l'd be willing to consider this theory of yours... if l didn't know chakotay as well as l do. there is no one on this ship l trust more. what you've done here is build what we call a house of cards. stardate 48658. commander seska is revealed to be a cardassian spy. she defects to the kazon and impregnates herself with chakotay's dna. was he unaware of the procedure, as he claims, or were they working together to create a new kazon sect to capture voyager? stardate 49522. chakotay recommends establishing trade relations with the kolhari. their technology uses tetryon power cells. a simple diplomatic overture, or was he seeking a source of energy for the catapult? stardate 4957 1... seven. naomi wildman. where are you going? that's not your concern. what's wrong? your father was ktarian. so? the ktarians were officially with the federation, but they sympathized with the maquis. what are you talking about? who are you working for, chakotay or the captain? seven... tell them it's too late. go! l picked up a power surge coming from the cargo bay. l detected the same thing. you think it's the enhanced alcove? could be. let's take a look. are phasers standard equipment on board now? must be. the data buffer's been activated. l wanted to make sure it wasn't malfunctioning. well, you should be careful. somebody might think you were trying to delete a few files. why would they think that? some of those files could contain sensitive information. lf that's true, somebody might think you were trying to do the same thing. that catapult out there- - it's a powerful piece of technology. lf the maquis ever had access to something like it, they might have been successful. and if we had, your mission to the delta quadrant never would have gotten off the drawing board. what are you talking about? the mission you've been on for the last five years. my only mission is trying to get voyager home. seven showed me the sensor records. l saw the tractor beam. she showed me the same thing, but she implicated you in some kind of maquis plot. same evidence. two different theories. lt all started with those damn photonic fleas. she was downloading voyager's database... bridge to captain janeway. go ahead, harry. l just picked up an unauthorized launch of the delta flyer. seven's at the helm. set a pursuit course. acknowledged. chakotay to the doctor. sick bay here. get down to cargo bay 2. run a diagnostic on seven's alcove. on my way. l'm glad we got that settled. likewise. chakotay... let's keep this one out of our logs, huh? gladly. she's altering course, heading for the catapult. maintain pursuit. open a channel. no response. try to beam her out. she's done something to alter her bio- signature. l can't get a lock. target her propulsion and weapons. fire. our targeting scanners are out of alignment. she must have done it before she took off. she's charging weapons. keep trying. doctor to captain janeway. report. seven downloaded too much data into her cortical implant. she's trying to make sense of more information than she can process. understood. beam me onto the delta flyer. l'm going with you. no, l have a better chance of getting through to her alone. this isn't part of your mission, is it? ls it part of yours? good luck. energize. captain. you came here hoping to stop me. you'll fail. turn this ship around. that's an order. your orders are irrelevant. l'm no longer under your command. you deceived me. there is no conspiracy. there is no maquis rebellion. the federation isn't planning to invade the delta quadrant. l realize that, because l finally uncovered your true objective. and what's that? me. stardate 3261 1. the federation sends my parents to study the borg collective. they know my family will be assimilated. that was their intention. stardate 48317. voyager is sent to the delta quadrant with orders to retrieve me. when they reach borg space, captain janeway negotiates an alliance with the collective in exchange for information regarding species 8472. they agree to give her seven of nine. stardate 51030. janeway extracts the implants from my body to remove any knowledge l have of her agreement with the borg. stardate 53329. captain janeway finalizes plans to use the catapult to deliver seven of nine to the alpha quadrant, where starfleet will dissect and analyze the drone to gather tactical data to fight the borg. l won't allow you to complete your mission. lf necessary, l'll destroy the catapult and myself. you're right, seven. there is a conspiracy here, but l believe it's a conspiracy of one. l've got a theory of my own. your modified alcove threw your synaptic patterns into chaos, and your mind can't make sense of all the information, so you're generating theory after theory in an attempt to bring order to that chaos. your reasoning is flawed. my alcove is functioning perfectly. what about you? you're not a drone anymore. you can't always predict how borg technology will affect you. you should be in sick bay, not behind that force field. let me help you. no. l don't believe you. of course you don't. anything l say gets woven into your paranoid conspiracies, but you should believe me, seven, because l've never lied to you. and l'm not lying to you now. you have to put your doubts aside and trust me. stardate 51030. seven of nine is severed from the hive mind. the captain tells her not to resist, that she'll learn to accept her humanity. seven complies and slowly begins to embrace her individuality. does she regret that decision? stardate 51652. the captain encourages seven to develop her social skills. seven insists it's a waste of time, but after further requests, she pursues it and begins to develop her first human friendships. did janeway lead her astray? stardate 52840. the captain orders seven to study her parents' journals. seven claims they're irrelevant, but eventually she reads them and rediscovers part of her own past. stardate 52841. for the first time, seven tells the captain... ''thank you.'' lt was stardate 52842... 0600 hours in the mess hall. we had just finished breakfast. my mistake. stardate today. janeway beams aboard the delta flyer. she reminds seven of the bond that's grown between them. seven lowers the force field and she decides to come home. all l'm asking is that you trust me again. delta flyer to voyager. two to beam out. captain's log, supplemental. after further testing, we activated the catapult and were hurtled across 30 sectors of space. ln less than an hour, we cut three years off our journey. l'm happy to say the doctor has repaired seven of nine's cortical processor, and she's returned to duty. guess who assimilated three books and ten reports in two days? naomi wildman. that's correct. are you taking your new alcove apart? yes. why? my attempt to download voyager's database failed. maybe you can fix it. the alcove functioned within expected parameters. unfortunately, l did not. three books and ten reports is impressive, but quantity is less relevant than quality. you must be able to interpret the data and enjoy the process. regardless, you require activities other than assimilating books and reports. a game of kadis- kot, for example. when? go to the mess hall and set up the board. l'll join you when l'm finished. l heard the strangest rumor today. apparently, the captain and first officer almost came to blows. mutiny? first officer walked the plank. so l heard. l don't believe a word of it. me, neither. seven was malfunctioning. we don't have that excuse. you're right. we've been through too much to stop trusting each other. you didn't poison the coffee, did you?"
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0," l'm not what a lot of people think. lf you're a dabo girl, you know, you get a reputation. miss sarda, tell me exactly what happened. when did you first have trouble with quark? - five minutes after l arrived. - he made advances? - he said it was part of the job. - what did you say? l said l'd wear the costume and entertain the gamblers but to keep his knuckles to himself. - that didn't stop him? - he said it was part of the job. he showed me my contract. there it is in the ferengi print. page 21, subsection d, paragraph 12. you're telling me the contract you signed requires you... l should have read it carefully. l'm not a legal expert. l'm not either, but l can assure you after l talk to quark, he won't hold you to this provision concerning the exchange... sensors are picking up elevated neutrino readings. something's coming through the wormhole. - excuse me. - thank you, commander. - are any of the transports due back? - not according to our logs. put us on yellow alert. lt doesn't match anything in starfleet files. l'm getting readings of a massive energy flux. lt may be damaged. sensors indicate a single, humanoid life-form on board. - hail it. - aye, sir. hail acknowledged. response coming in. on screen. welcome to the alpha quadrant. - l'm commander benjamin sisko. - alpha quadrant? you've passed through a wormhole into a new part of the galaxy. - l saw a small ship disappear. l followed it. - that was one of our patrol vessels. you've travelled almost 90,000 light years. - where are you from? - how long does this anomaly last? lt's stable. you can return whenever you want to. for now, dock here. we'll answer your questions. no. no time. lnertial stress is overloading his structural capacity. - prepare to transport him off his ship. - l will not abandon my vessel. - your ship is in danger of... - l will not leave. we can use a tractor beam to tow him in. the beam should show up the structural integrity. - do it. - cut your engines. - why? - so l can save your ship, friend. we'll try to fix you up as good as new. good. engaging tractor beam. steady now. feel the graviton field taking hold? yes. you'll be fine now. just relax and enjoy the ride. we might want to skip formal first-contact procedures. agreed. meet him by yourself at the airlock. - he might find that less intimidating. - aye, sir. and, if you can, find out what he's so nervous about. aye, sir. o'brien to ops. go ahead, chief. sure you didn't beam this fellow out? - negative. - he's not in here. sensors say he's still on board, chief. friend? lf you're in here, you've got nothing to worry about from me. understand? l'm just going to take a look at your ship. see what the problem is. ok? just to let you know, l'm an engineer. l know a little bit about ships. well, more than a little, actually. but l'll tell you, l've never seen anything close to this. all right, then. ls this some sort of plasma injector? ok. then... that must be an off-axis fuel controller over there. huh-huh... the coladrium flow has been damaged. you can't go sneaking up on someone like that. lt's an alpha quadrant rule. - can it be repaired? - that all depends. - depends? - on what exactly a coladrium flow is. on my world, it would be simple. l could do it myself. l didn't say we couldn't figure it out. you'll just have to teach me. l'm sure we can... l have no time. l know. everyone's in a hurry these days. we'll have you away as soon as it's humanly possible. that's me - human species. name's o'brien. o'brien. miles o'brien. chief of operations. how about you? - l am tosk. - that's your name or your species? l am tosk. oh. well, tosk it is. come on. there's nothing to be afraid of out there. we've got to wait for your reactor to cool down. come on. l've got work to do. what happened? looks like you took a shot to your hull. the passage through the anomaly was very rough. yeah, sure. the wormhole can shake you up, all right. security sensor. screens for weapons. lt's just picking up my phaser. you're fine. - you wear a weapon? - defensive purposes only. lt may not seem hospitable, but when you go into an alien ship you never know what might be in there. you may even find someone who can make himself invisible, you know? l understand. - a health centre? - yeah. that's dr bashir. he looks after our medical problems. - how many live here? - well... 300, more or less. what is its purpose? purpose? defence? surveillance? sometimes, when l walk along here, l feel like we're the flea markets of the sector. but l guess our real job is to keep an eye on the wormhole. there's traffic going in and out all the time now. - many ships dock here? - five or six a week. we sometimes have a whole convoy on its way through the wormhole. but you have the honour of being the first visitor from the other side. others will detect ships from your quadrant, as l did, and follow them here. we hope so. our mission is to seek out new life-forms so we can learn about each other. madam, l distinctly saw you move your wager to the green line after the play was completed. l will return your currency, but you will promptly leave the establishment. you are not welcome here. there are some things to learn about us that can wait. how about you? are you an explorer? a scientist? l am tosk. right. computer, lights. l wasn't the decorator. - l wish to begin work on my ship. - we'll start as soon as we can. why don't you get some rest? l require only 17 minutes of sleep per rotation. really? lf l don't get eight hours l'm not the same man. - are you hungry? - hungry? would you like to eat? take in sustenance? liquid nutrients are stored in plasmic fibres throughout my body. oh. well, this is the food replicator in case you change your mind. we've finally got it making a good bowl of oatmeal. just ask the computer if you need anything else. o'brien? thank you. as the vulcans say, ''we're here to serve.'' - computer. - state request. l wish to see a display of this facility. specify exterior or interior display. lnterior. lnterior display available in 19 sections. specify requirements. show me where the weapons are stored. habitat ring. level five. section three. access restricted to security clearance seven and above. lt's hard to say, sir. you hate to prejudge anyone. - what are you thinking, chief? - you know the old saying... a man looking over his shoulder is waiting for trouble. you think he's on the run? he wasn't telling the whole truth about the damage to his ship. lt wasn't the wormhole. somebody took a shot at him. lt came in at a 45-degree angle to the hull, sliced through two propulsion systems. l'll know more later. stay with him as much as possible while he's here. - l'll tell odo to watch him, too. - aye, sir. no. the coladrium flows through the arva nodes. are they some kind of high-energy magnetic coils? for fuel replenishment. fuel? - like a ramscoop. - ramscoop? to capture stellar gases and convert them into usable fuel. yes. the arva nodes convert space matter into fuel. got you. piece of cake. piece of cake. ramscoop. arva nodes. piece of cake. lt's an old human expression. lt means it'll be easy to fix. - they will be easy to fix? - sure. we'll get my crew to remove your arva nodes then we'll make new ones. piece of cake. how long? maybe a day or two. we'll run some tests after the replacement unit's in. no. no time for that. l let you take that unit out without proper testing, it breaks down, you blame me, then my work has a bad reputation in the gamma quadrant. l would not blame you. l was joking, tosk. l cannot tell, o'brien. sorry, it's in my nature. and you're the most natural straight man l've met in ages. come on. while the fellas are working l'll buy you a drink and you can tell me why you're in such a rush. dabo! nothing like this exists on my world. this is where we do most of our r&r. what is r&r? rest and relaxation. downtime. when we're not working. you sleep a full third of your rotation. you rest and relax while you are awake. alpha quadrant has far too much downtime. my wife would laugh at that. she's barely seen me in the last three weeks. we are very different, tosk and o'brien. l've noticed. hey, barkeep. don't call me barkeep. l'm not a barkeep. l'm your host. the proprietor. a sympathetic ear to wretched souls. and a man who will exploit any vice you may have. two synthales, barkeep. l am sorry. l have no vices for you to exploit. a challenge. tosk is our first guest from the gamma quadrant. l'd take him at his word. perhaps a short adventure in a holosuite? - holosuite? - a fantasy encounter with danger. romance. thrills. created for your personal entertainment by the brothers quark. l have no use for fantasy adventure. l live the greatest adventure one could ever desire. then l envy you, mr tosk. what are you talking about, tosk? what is this adventure you're on? l cannot discuss it. sure. of course. - you've changed your mind about him? - not exactly. he's running from something, that's for sure. and he's in danger. and he can't or won't talk about it. people tell doctors things they wouldn't tell others. lf you could get him to have a medical... l kind of like him. l'm not even sure why. ln a way, he's almost naive. l guess anyone would be in an alien environment. but l don't sense criminal intent or dishonesty about him. he lied about the damage to his ship. he didn't exactly lie. he didn't exactly tell the truth. he keeps the truth pretty much to himself. - when will his ship be ready? - tomorrow. we don't have much of a choice. we can't hold him. lf he tells the truth, fine. lf not...wish him well and send him on his way. just what do you think you're doing? computer, seal off corridor 14a, habitat level five. - seal confirmed. - security to habitat 5-14a. when you get tired of bouncing off forcefields, we can talk. l did nothing to you. lt's that security junction l'm curious about. - l must prepare. - for what? l cannot discuss it. l am tosk. l'm sure you are. let's go down to my office while chief o'brien looks to see what you've been doing. - o'brien? - right. l'm going to release the forcefields now. l don't need a fight from you. understand? l will not fight you. good. computer, release the security seals. - l cannot discuss it. - l can't accept that. l did nothing to you. tampering with the security grid is a threat. he was trying to shut out the lock-outs to section three. - the weapons locker. - what did you want with weapons? are you wanted by authorities in the gamma quadrant? - wanted? - have you committed crimes? never. - l am tosk. - what does that mean? should that explain all this? lt is all l can say. don't you think we deserve some answers? - what should l do with him? - hold him for now. we'll wait to see if someone shows up looking for him. enough of this craziness, tosk. tell me. what were you doing? o'brien, you must let me out. tell me. allow me to die with honour. die? who'd want to kill you, tosk? allow me to die with honour. he's climbing the walls like a trapped animal. l'm sorry our jail cells aren't to his liking. somehow l feel responsible. - you do? - yeah. well... l guess l kind of adopted him. l talked him into coming on board. you didn't talk him into breaking into the security system. l just feel sorry for him. l don't think he means us any harm. what the hell is his secret? sensors are picking up ionised l-band emissions. - the patterns match tosk's ship. - hail them. maybe we'll get a few answers. no response. again. rotate frequencies. lt's a modulated particle beam. lt's scanning us. - ready shields. - not yet. let them look at us. l'm reading phased power fluctuations. they may be readying a transporter. - now, major. - shields up. open all hailing channels. this is commander benjamin sisko of the united... they're bombarding us with some kind of radiation. very rapid magnetic flux variations. what the... they've reversed the polarity of our shields! l'm picking up transporter locks. - they're beaming on board. - location? promenade. security to the promenade. kira and o'brien with me. dax, you have ops. ready phasers. l'm commander of this station. put down your weapons. lncrease setting to level six. - lt's tosk they're after. - maybe they have a right to him. nobody's abducting a prisoner out of my brig. - you may need this. - l never use them. l have tosk. alive. lt is over. what a disappointment. - and after such an entertaining beginning. - entertaining? these aliens gave us a lot of resistance. how did you get their cooperation without violating your oath of silence? l told them nothing! but to see you here, caged! helpless! how could you allow this? lt is a disgrace to all tosk. and the most disappointing hunt in memory. this whole thing is a hunt and tosk is the prey? you were right. this tosk is unworthy of such a noble description. for this dishonour you'll endure the greatest humiliation tosk can know - to be captured and brought home alive. you will live on public display where children can make fun of you, toss you scraps of food, which is more than you deserve. release him. you disrupted life on this station for the pleasure of your hunt? l'm not inclined to take orders from you. odo, watch the prisoner while our guest and l discuss this. unless you intend to take him by force, in which case l'll open fire on your ship. over this tosk? have you nothing similar in your society? centuries ago, people engaged in blood sports, killing for pleasure. a few cultures still do. even they wouldn't hunt a sentient being! he is sentient only because we made him sentient. he has been bred for the hunt. his entire reason to exist is the hunt. to make it as exciting, as interesting, as he can. - you do not comprehend. - l comprehend just fine. l have no tolerance for the abuse of any life-form. abuse? we honour tosk. they are the symbol of all that is noble and courageous. they train and condition themselves all their lives for this event. they're proud of their role in our culture. l can't judge what is right and wrong for your world. but on this station... ln future, passage through the anomaly will be considered out of bounds. will that satisfy you? now you will arrange for release of the tosk. l've agreed to release him. but tosk is an intelligent, living being. lt's their custom, chief. we have no right to interfere. what if tosk were to request asylum? lf he asks for it... all right. l have a way out for you. a way out? of here? request asylum. asylum? you ask for the protection of the federation. you understand? my commander is willing to protect you. o'brien. l am tosk. l cannot hide here, behind the protection of your federation. lt is against everything l believe. you'd rather go back and live in a cage on public display? to stay would be a greater dishonour. l am tosk - the hunted. l live to outwit the hunters for another day. to survive until l die with honour. but that will not be my fate. but l will not deny my existence as tosk. thank you, o'brien. but l cannot request asylum. l'm not impressed with the tourist trade from the gamma quadrant. - not one has bought a drink. - shut up. more trouble with the little woman? - what does that mean? - you might want to talk. there is nothing wrong between my wife and l. lf there were, l wouldn't talk to some barkeep about it. sorry. my mistake. what? your face gets very pink when it gets aggravated. - much more than other humans. - so stop aggravating me. not me. you came in this way. - ok, l'm aggravated. - l am a keen observer of behaviour. - do you want to talk? - no. - why not? - lt wouldn't do any good talking to you. - try me. - forget it. lt's just the rules of the game. uh-huh. rules of the game. go on. lt's a hunt. did you know that? they're chasing tosk in a hunt. they're playing by their rules, we're playing by ours and he's caught in the middle. l suppose if the ferengi don't like the rules, they change them. - rules are subject to interpretation. - of course! change the rules... why didn't l think of that? thanks, barkeep. so. what's bothering you today? computer, access the power grid to security checkpoint four in the promenade. that isn't necessary. our ritual requires it when a tosk is captured alive. let's go. l'll escort the prisoner to the transporter station. - this is a security matter. - this is a starfleet matter. - orders from sisko. - we'll see about that. do not trouble yourself. my ship will transport us. that won't be necessary. good relations with other cultures is our highest priority. commander sisko wants to apologise to you for interfering with your hunt. we'll give you an official escort off the station. lt's a token of goodwill and respect in our society. very well. starfleet has no business taking charge of a prisoner transport. what are you talking about? you ordering o'brien to escort tosk off the station. l didn't give him any orders at all. sisko to o'brien. mr o'brien, report to ops immediately. this way. glass jaw. now l know why you wear a helmet. up here. the hunt has resumed. come on. your ship's ready. security reports a fight in the promenade. here. apparently, o'brien set him loose. l'm showing someone in an access conduit above quark's. two life-forms. one's human. - they're heading to the docking ring. - l'll seal off the corridors. - they won't get far. - constable. there's no hurry. here. now you are tosk as well, o'brien. these conduits are made from two-metre thick duranium composite. l've never seen a scanning device that could penetrate it. till now. around this next corner and we're there. no. he is mine. no. go on. what now? the hunt... goes on. - you wish to come? - no. no. one day as a tosk is enough for me. and my wife and kid wouldn't fit into this lifestyle. - will you be punished for helping me? - maybe. but if l know my commander... hell, those guys wanted a hunt. l just gave them one. you'd better get out of here while you still can. o'brien. die with honour, o'brien. die with honour, tosk. just what did happen at that security checkpoint, chief? the weapons sensors must have overloaded on all his gear. - must have? - yes, sir. must have since l increased their output by about 200 per cent. so you assaulted him - our first contact with a new species. yes, sir. we've got dozens of top-level officials waiting to hear about the first new life-forms to come through the wormhole. how will l write this up? well, sir, l'm not one to say, but... these hunters weren't happy at having to bring tosk home. ln the interest of mutual understanding and future relations... save it! you ignored your duty to starfleet. you took off your combadge and ignored me. you even ignored the prime directive by interfering. another stunt like this and your wife won't have to complain about conditions here. - do l make myself clear? - l understand. - l was surprised by one thing, sir. - what's that? l knew l couldn't override all the security seals in the station. and l figured once you and the constable located us it'd be over. we'd find ourselves locked behind some forcefield somewhere. l guess that one got by us. yes, sir. - thank you, sir. - dismissed."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"tonight at 11:00... doom! boy, that thing's big. fry, is my colossal eye too big? - no, it's what makes you you. - but it's so round, so hideously round. leela, listen. you're the most beautiful woman i've ever known. - oh. so you only care about my looks? - no, i... what? finally, new new york got a blast of class today as nikolai, playboy ruler of the robo-hungarian empire, arrived aboard his extravagant caviar-powered yacht. i am just a humble emperor with a big, big crown! of course i'm not planning to steal that crown! - what? - true. i've always dreamed of being an emperor. you know, for halloween, and then forever. but heisting those jewels would be difficult. - you'd be stupid to try. - i'll need accomplices. a sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard. never! a claw man to slip past the metal detector and cut the alarm wires. sorry, i'm set for life after that last job. and finally, a chump, to be caught on video and later arrested. as i told you on sucker-punch day, i'm through being a chump. of course, it would all require split-second robotic timing. that's where i come in. you see, i own a watch. there. this time i'm sure i've fixed the mind switcher. good, i'm sick of cleaning up those heaps of dead monkeys. but why would you want your mind in a new body? well, as a man enters his 18th decade, he thinks back on the mistakes he's made in life. like the heaps of dead monkeys? science cannot move forward without heaps! no, what i regret is the youth i wasted playing it safe. - i wasted my youth porking out. - yes, i remember. would you please take that down? it's making me hungry. funny, i could use a little extra meat on my bones. wait a second! if we switched bodies, i could live life to the extreme, and you could indulge your demonic food lust. we're just the people this mind switcher was made for by us! - wait, can i still change my mind? - let's find out. it didn't work, you doddering old... ah! cartilage! dude, i bid you a fond cowabunga. i'm off to laugh at the reaper. look out, world, here i... i'm sorry, amy, but your body's not up to the task. also, i don't care for these boobs flapping every which way. now, quit your bologna-gargling and let's switch back into our original bodies. body-switching, eh? mayhap the heist is back on. who needs accomplices, if i can just use their bodies? professor, what's not happening? bad news, me. i failed to take into account the cerebral immune response. you idiot! once two bodies have switched minds, they can never switch back. however, perhaps they can. maybe we can swap back using a third body for temporary storage space. i'm 60% storage space. you are? i... mmm? well, i'm off to the royal yacht for a quick seduce-and-snatch. see you! now, then, amy, we'll simply switch bodies, and then we'ii... we'ii... no, i'd be back in my body, but then you and bender would be switched. and the amy and bender bodies can't trade minds again, since they just did. oh, no! is it possible to get everyone back to normal using four or more bodies? i'm not sure. i'm afraid we need to use math. stupid air-needing lungs. the crown jewels. now i just have to locate the guard and seduce him in... - four seconds? who goes there? three, two, one. hello, big boy. silence! i am basil, the emperor's cousin and chief of his royal guard. and i shall not be seduced by a... i said... professor? what's the matter? i'm amy. the professor and i switched bodies. oh, lord. all i wanted was to gorge myself a little, but i can't digest anything with these false teeth and this hit-or-miss colon. at least you get a senior discount at the movies. i hate paying $14 to see nicolas cage solve things. if you want to save $2, we could switch bodies. hmm. we can always switch back, right? hey, leela. mmm. what smells saturated? deep-fried ice cream sandwich wrapped in frosting and lightly baconed. whoa. that sounds like something amy would say and eat. i am amy. leela and i used the professor's mind-switching machine. so leela's in your body? not exactly. aha! you do only like me for my body! that is entirely not true, sir! now to go switch bodies with zoidberg, sneak past the metal detector and clip the alarm wires, all in less than... ten minutes ago? oh! uh, could you come back when my chump gets here? now, then, what is a filthy human doing aboard my royal yacht? with all due respect, your majesty, i'm a robot like you. i just switched bodies with some bimbo. go ahead, ask me something only a robot would know. a reverse turing test, eh? very good. - what is the square root of nine? - uh, hold on, let me just get out a pencil. okay, look, i'm not that kind of robot. i'm more this kind of robot. - he steps forwards but moves backwards. - by the gods! he is a machine! no, that won't restore everyone, either. besides, i don't want my decrepit old body back! i'm running away with this invincible robot body and joining something. look, i paid for 15 robot clowns per cubic meter of car, and you're barely giving me 12. now, crumple up and get in... and fasten your seatbelts. come on! good day. i am nonchalanto, the robot daredevil. and my dream is to risk my life in strange and original ways. hmm. you don't look so foolhardy to me. that's the dumbest thing anybody's ever done. you're hired! so you're a common bending robot, with a human peasant roommate? oh, crap, that is what i am! no, bender, i envy you. i'm so bored with all these pretentious trappings. the jewels, the parties, the beautiful robo-women. hello. my fiancée, princess flavia. dearest, meet bender. he's a robot in the body of a chinese martian physicist. how tedious. oh, to escape this gilded cage for a day. you know, we could trade bodies. i could take over the humdrum royal stuff, and you could be a regular joe for a day. or more. much more. in that horrid non-robot body? sir, i have my standards. ah, but what if i could put you in my fabulous bending-robot body? me, posing as a lowly bending unit? how wicked! but wait, i'm supposed to give a speech at the u.n. tomorrow. - can i trust you to do it? - you can trust anything. so now leela's all crotchety because she thinks i'm not attracted to her in the professor's body. - you aren't, are you? - of course not! but i was willing to lie about it. what more can a man do? a man can give her a toke of her own medicine. yes! i could put my mind into a hideous body and show leela she's not attracted to me. but it would have to be a really, really disgusting body. friends! friends! i've got barnacles on my tuchus. the long search is over. wait here and earn interest while i find my robot body. - professor? - leela. amy? bender. have you seen my body? i think the professor's in it. yeah, he said something about running away. - then he ran away. - what? whither? what am i gonna do? i got an emperor all patsied up to switch bodies, but only with another robot! washbucket full. scruffy's work here is done. now to find emperor von richendoof. now to find scruffy. switch bodies? i don't see why not. i also don't see why. in your face, leela. if you're a bender, why is your body full of fetid water? if you're an emperor, why don't you shut up? move it, fry! - well, so long. - wait! - point me to my normal human roommate! - that's him there. maybe. got to go! robot? yes, 'tis i, bender. do you not recognize your own best friend? aha! the guy in this body has a friend! bender, old pal! it's me, the fry! but then nicolas cage discovered the real treasure was his family. yes, i'll hold. hey, leela, look! i'm in zoidberg! fry? you're not so shallow that you find me repulsive because of my body, are you? not at all. amy? stop it! fry, help! she's turning me into a parade float. ew! look at her! oh. so you're so shallow that my body disgusts you - if it puts on a little extra weight? - that wasn't a little extra weight. admit it! you don't care about the inner me at all! no, you admit it! you'd be ashamed to be seen in public with someone as hideous as me! - would not! - oh, yeah? then i challenge you to a romantic dinner at elzar's tonight. it's on. sweet orca of majorca! you make fat albert look like normal albert! i don't know what to do. do you think i should eat more butter? i am putting a stop to this right now! come on. we're switching bodies. hermes, no! i'll ruin your body, too! three decades of the munchies beat you to it. you make quite a show, young man. you remind me of myself as a young cannon. big bertha is the circus's grande dame. she shoots robots through the air. excuse me. too much goulash. i've always wanted to be shot out of something. how about a quick blast after lunch? alas, a fine big one like you would shatter my barrel. but, ah, to amaze the crowd once more. i understand the problems of age, but suppose i could put you in a new body? never! my body may be old, but it is mine, and every crack a memory of heavy things shot a long way. good day! i have everything i ever wanted. money, wealth, riches. yet something's missing. a hot princess with whom to get grizzly. - hello. - hello, baby! huh? hey, what's going on here? and why are you kissing my dashing cousin instead of me? nikolai, you imperial fool. we've been having an affair for 700 years. at long last, i shall kill you, blame the burglar and inherit the throne. farewell, nikolai. wait! i'm not nikolai! i'm bender, the fabulous body-switching burglar. so you are. however, you do have nikolai's body, and that's the part we want to kill. great food, huh? ew! i'm sorry, leela. i hope that didn't make you ashamed to be seen with me. no, it only makes you more attractive. ew! oh! did my bodily infirmity embarrass you? not at all. it's just another thing that makes you a very special lady. you mean, like my penis? - admit it! you're disgusted by me! - no, you're disgusted by me! - i'm as attracted to you as i've ever been! - prove it! well, bender, here's our apartment that we live in every day. a floor? we live like kings! kings? silence! like you, i'm a common lout. now fetch me some working-class cognac from our brandy storeroom that you know how to find. uh... relax, bender. i'll dry up that leak with this heating box. ah, cigars. light me up, old friend. there you are, emperor nikolai. it's time for your speech to the u.n. what now? - miss wong? - no, scruffy, i am washbucket. i love you. washbucket has always loved you. this is wrong, washbucket. oh, it would be sweet for a while, but in the back of our minds, we'd know that i'm a man and you're janitorial equipment. in another city, we could be anyone we want! go. go now, before i beg you to stay. yep. please welcome an insane dictator, and one heck of a bowler, emperor nikolai! thanks, nixon. how we doing? i love you, your majesty! - shut up, madame ambassador! i know it! anyhow, i'd now like to digress from my prepared remarks to say i'm done! ladies and gentlemen, this robot is an impostor! - i shall enjoy this. - not me! that devil, basil, will kill our emperor. you're robo-hungarian? yes. our nation's chief export is carnies. if only there were some way i could get to the u.n. to help. there is. get in, nonchalanto. bertha, no! it would kill you! i have not so much time left anyhow. but you could get a new body! you could have a rich, full life! i am trying to have a rich, full life! long live robo-hungary! me! thank god you've come! this is for big bertha! that is not what i meant to give you for big bertha. - that was nice. - oh, yeah. ow! ow! whoever you are, you're the bravest robot i've ever seen. i like killing brave things. good! because i've got 20 of them per cubic meter. when i grow up, i want to be a diplomat! well, if there's one thing i've learned, it's a lesson. i believe this belongs to you. i shall sell it to help the common folk, now that i understand their misery. yeah, good luck with that. i must say, hermes, you've got a smoking-hot body. i was inspired by amy. - wow! how'd you do it? - well, there i was at elzar's, eating a nice pork sundae, and suddenly, i just lost my appetite. forever. q to the e to the d! so it is possible for us all to get back to our original bodies? stone-cold munching, prof. sweet clyde, characterize your inversion theorem. basically, no matter how permuted-up your minds are, they can be restored using, at most, two extra players. and they say pure math has no real-world applications! everybody back in their zones? - yes sir! - yes! ah! my body may be old, but it is mine. brilliant work, clyde! you'll win the nba's highest academic honor for this. also, i'm making you a duke. - so long, filthy commoners! - adios! and i'm left with the real jewels safely inside... his compartment? all right. i'll need accomplices. english - us - sdh"
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"good evening. did anyone see a golf ball go by? it couldn't have gone far. i just gave it a toss. i've been employing this means of getting around the golf course since the club voted to ban all motorized carts. it was a ban i heartily endorsed. by the way, since the carts were always tipping over when they ran over laggards, this slowed up the game terribly. this system of travel also helps me comply with another rule, which was made because of the crowded condition of the course. we are asked to play in foursomes. but i believe you tuned in for a story. i shall step aside and allow you to play through. hello. well, look who's here. sleeping beauty himself. aw, cut it out, will you? what's the matter, joe? did the noon whistle wake you up? that late already? boy, i must have really been pooped. what's for breakfast? you mean lunch, don't you? i've been up since 8:00 listening to you snore. things aren't bad enough, you've got to watch television till 2:00 in the morning. it was a good movie. don't you see enough movies? now what does that crack mean? oh, you know what i mean. don't you think i know where you spend your afternoons? i've been looking for work every day. what as? an usher? put your toast in. look, irene, i've been to half a dozen employment agencies this week, and i went on two interviews. they just didn't pan out, that's all. how come they never pan out with you, joe? how come everybody else is working and you can't even collect unemployment insurance anymore? you're gonna burn those eggs. the papers are full of jobs. i can read, you know. yeah, they're full of jobs, but what kind of jobs, huh? you just don't understand the way it is with me, irene. you never did. i'm not a laborer. then get a job in an office. you mean a clerk's job? yes! that's not for me. i gotta have something with a future. you should've taken that job my brother offered. and sell shoes? i'd starve first. we might just do that! do you know that mr. waters won't give me any more credit? do you know that i haven't even got a bottle of milk in this house? aw, what's the matter with this toast? this thing's broken, irene. (sighing) it was all right this morning. oh, no! it's the electricity. oh, how do you like that for nerve? they cut us off. nerve! nerve! we haven't paid a bill in three months! (sobbing) aw, forget it, honey. we'll get along for a while. it'll be kind of romantic with candles around this place. (crying) oh, joe. i'm so ashamed. i'm so ashamed. there's nothing to be ashamed of. we've got to get some money, joe. we need money! okay, okay. i'll go out this afternoon and take the first thing that comes along. we need it now, we need it right now! we can't go on owing everybody. maybe if we asked davey. oh, no, you don't! i'm not asking your brother for another dime. look, i'll tell you what we'll do. i'll go out and get ourselves a loan to tide us over. just a small one. and then i'll go back to that employment agency and i'll take anything they offer. i'll dig ditches, irene, anything. there, does that make you feel better? oh, joe. it's gonna be okay, honey. don't you worry about a thing. it's gonna be all right. i see by your application, mr. helmer, that your last employment was in food merchandising. (chuckles) just what kind of work was that? i worked in a meat market. pardon? i sold meat in a supermarket. oh, yeah. that was way back in april, according to this. have you been on the unemployment insurance since then? it stopped last month. and you're married? yes. no children, i see. you've had quite a number of jobs in that time, haven't you? (chuckles) route salesman, waiter, dry cleaner, printer... printer... printers do pretty well, don't they, mr. helmer? well, i, uh, wasn't exactly a printer. i was a night watchman in a big printing plant. i guess that's a mistake, what i wrote there. oh, i see. and the purpose of the loan? oh, it says home improvement. home improvement? yes, yes, that's right. do you have any collateral, mr. helmer? any stocks or bonds, jewelry, anything like that? no. do you own a car? no. you're not making this easy for me, mr. helmer. now, i told you that the friendship corporation doesn't like to turn anyone away from its door, but you present a rather... what shall i say? a bleak picture of your finances. look, i only want to borrow 100 bucks! i'm not looking for any million. well, the amount isn't the problem. it's your credit. you haven't worked for three months. you haven't any collateral. say, what about a co-signer? do you think you could find one? no, i don't think i could do that. or some relative maybe? no! i'm asking nothing of them. nothing! i'm trying to help you, mr. helmer, but under the circumstances, i... you mean i don't get the money? what can i do? my hands are tied. okay, okay. if that's the way you want it. thank you. hey, mister! mister, you all right? he's dead. well, you certainly took your time. those stairs are murder. it's warm, you know. the refrigerator isn't working. i don't care. well? what about it? did you get the loan? no, i didn't get the loan. well, you know how they are. you can't get any money unless you can prove you don't need it. i'm not surprised. well, we'll just have to call davey tomorrow. i won't have to call davey. then what are we going to do? i don't mind candlelight suppers, only there won't be any supper. you know that, don't you? i know. oh, stop it, joe. (laughing) come on! i'm in no mood for kidding around. you know where i was all afternoon? how should i know? in the movies, i suppose. you're wrong. i was with an old pal of mine, a buddy from the army. i hope he bought the drinks. he did better than that. he remembered about some dough he borrowed from me when we were both stationed at fort bragg. i got him out of a real jam once, and he remembered. shows there are still some nice people in the world. are you serious? sure, i'm serious. want to see the money? sure, let's see it. i'm not sure i'll recognize the stuff, but let's try. oh, joe. how much is that? 275 bucks. (chuckles) almost $300. (laughing) it's exactly what he owed me. it's about time we got a break, isn't it? oh, joe, this is wonderful! now we can give $50 to mr. peterson! (laughing) and $100 to mr. waters, so we can get back our charge account. and we'll call the electric company... hey, take it easy, will you? leave out about 10 bucks for a good steak dinner tonight. we owe it to ourselves, don't we? tonight? you really mean it? sure, i mean it. i'll take you to that steakhouse on 1st avenue. oh, joe! come on now. (both laughing) i gotta shave, and you put on your blue dress and we'll get going, huh? i'm starved. all right. (humming) ""marvin horne,"" ""9 east 70th street, new york."" thank you, marvin. no. ""i am not dead."" ""i am subject to a form of cataleptic illness, which may appear to cause death."" ""if i am found, notify at once,."" ""dr. nelson kruger, 441 east 64th street."" ""plaza 3..."" ""i'm not dead."" (whimpers) i thought you were shaving. i've got to go out, irene. out? out where? well, i can't explain now. it's something i forgot, something important. but what about our dinner? you told me to get dressed. i've got to go out! (ambulance siren wailing) good evening, officer. evening. some excitement, huh? that was an ambulance, wasn't it? man dropped dead in the street. you sure he was dead? oh, he was dead, all right. do you know anything about it, mister? me? yeah, you. not a thing. just passing by, saw the ambulance. i was just curious, that's all. lady over telephone: dr. kruger's office. hello, can i speak to dr. kruger, please? i'm sorry, dr. kruger's not available right now. may i take a message? well, where is he? i have to talk to him. he's on vacation. if you'll just give me your name. look, my name's not important! are you his nurse? no, sir, this is his answer service. lady over telephone: operator. operator? get me the police. 21st precinct, sergeant dugan. look, one of your ambulances just picked up a man at 17th street and 2nd avenue. about an hour ago. what was that name again? i didn't give any name. look, i'm talking about the man who fell dead in the street. the one that they took away. i wanted to tell you that he isn't really dead. hey, what is this, some kind of a joke? look, i'm serious. the guy had a kind of an attack, that's all, but you shouldn't bury him. whatever you do, don't bury him! look, mac, i'll tell you what you do. come on over here and tell us all about it, huh? come on over right now. no, i... irene: joe? yeah. thanks for the steak dinner. i'm sorry. i opened a can of pork and beans. there's still some left if you want any. it's not exactly sirloin, but it's filling. i'm not hungry. you going to tell me where you went? it was nothing important. i just forgot something at that bar, the place where i met my army buddy. went back to see if it was still there. i guess it was. i can smell it. so i had a couple of beers. we have beer at home. for pete's sake, do we have to have a quiz program every night? oh, joe. joe, what's happening to us? this morning we were picking at each other because we didn't have any money. and tonight, i've got a jar full of $20 bills, and... joe? it's not another girl, is it? no, it's not another girl. now will you just please leave me alone for a while? sure. i'll leave you alone. no, ma'am, there's no law against keeping a dog in the backyard. long as the animal isn't giving any trouble, there's nothing we can do about it. yes, you let us know. thank you, ma'am. yes, sir, what can i do for you? my name's helmer. i'm the one who telephoned tonight. oh, we've had a lot of calls tonight. what was yours about? about the dead man on 17th street. oh, yes, i remember. you're the man who said he wasn't dead. yeah. would you have a seat right over there? i spoke to lieutenant bates about this. he'd like to speak to you. okay. lieutenant bates, please. say, lieutenant, you remember that doa on 17th street? well, that man just came in, the one that called. right. he'll be with you in a minute. this is mr. helmer, lieutenant. mr. helmer, i'm lieutenant bates. lieutenant. must admit, mr. helmer, that your phone call kind of puzzled me. you sure we're talking about the same man? yeah, i'm sure. it was on 17th street, about 9:00. small, well-dressed man, gray hair, about 60? yes, that's him. and you don't think he's dead? i know he isn't dead! he looked pretty dead when they brought him in here. there was no heartbeat, no pulse, no nothing. the doctor examined him, said he was dead. they wrote out a death certificate. the body's in the morgue now awaiting burial. so, you see, mr. helmer, there's nothing to worry about. he's really dead. now take my word for it. you think i'm insane! you think i'm some kind of nut! i didn't say that, mr. helmer. yeah, but that's what you're thinking, right? only you're wrong. i saw the guy's wallet. he had a card in it that said he wasn't dead! we didn't find any card. yeah, but it was there! i saw it! how did you see it, mr. helmer? well, i saw him when he fell down and i went looking through his pockets for identification, you know? go on. so i saw this card! it said he was a cataleptic. it said he might look dead, but he really wasn't. are you sure that's how it happened? all right. so i took his wallet. i thought he was dead. i thought he wouldn't need the money anymore, that's what i thought. only you've got to stop them, lieutenant! you can't let them bury him! max? bates. the stiff they brought in tonight, was it transferred to the city morgue? yeah. it's still in the freezer, huh? well, showcase him, we'll be right down. mr. helmer. hope it's not too cold for you, mr. helmer. they keep it pretty chilly down here. i'm okay. can you identify this man, mr. helmer? yeah, that's him. that's marvin horne. his name is not horne. it's capper, sonny boy capper. we've known about him for a long, long time. it's our business to know about men like sonny boy. he was one of the slickest pickpockets in the country. till his bum heart gave out. pickpocket? then this isn't marvin horne? let's go upstairs, mr. helmer. we've got some talking to do. i hear the shout of, ""fore."" apparently someone is counting my horses again. i shall have to move on. suppose you join me at the next tee. i found this in the rough we just passed through. i wonder who it belongs to. until next week, good night."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"this textbook is what you wanted me to see? not exactly. look familiar? this was my first astronomy book. my father got it for me on my eighth birthday. i used to stare at the cover for hours. the arachnid nebula. who'd ever have thought i would get to see it in person? it's less than a light-year away. we'll be there in a few hours. ""from the library of admiral jonny archer""? i had high hopes when i was a kid. yes? sir, there's a ship approaching at half impulse. they're hailing us. do you know who it is? hoshi says they're using a vulcan frequency. doesn't look like any vulcan ship i've ever seen. this class of vessel hasn't been used for a long time. they're hailing us again. is this the earth vessel enterprise? it is. i'm captain jonathan archer. my name is tavin, captain of the vahklas. it's very good to meet you. it's been a long road getting from there to here it's been a long time but my time is finally near and i will see my dream come alive at last i will touch the sky and they're not gonna hold me down no more no, they're not gonna change my mind 'cause i've got faith of the heart i'm going where my heart will take me i've got faith to believe i can do anything i've got strength of the soul no one's gonna bend or break me i can reach any star i've got faith i've got, i've got, i've got i've got faith faith of the heart. i get the feeling you weren't sent out here by the high command. not quite. we're a civilian ship. what brings you out this far? i suppose you could say we're on a mission of exploration. from what i'm told, vulcans aren't that interested in exploring. we're not typical vulcans. i'd be happy to explain, but first, i'd like to ask a favor. certainly. our propulsion and life-support systems are in need of repair. we'd be grateful for any assistance you could offer. we'll see what we can do. we've noticed the high command looking over our shoulders on several occasions, as well. that's good to know. i was starting to think they'd singled us out. hmm. our chef's had a lot of experience lately preparing vulcan dishes. t'pol says he's gotten pretty good at it. uh-uh-uh, what is that? oh, it's called ""chicken."" oh, uh... may i? of course. it's, um... meat, you know. it looks delicious. so... when did you leave vulcan? uh, eight years ago. and in those eight years, we've experienced more than most vulcans will in their lifetime. you said you were explorers? yes, but it's not space we're exploring, it's ourselves. mmm! you're v'tosh ka'tur. i'm sorry? ""vulcans without logic."" it's a name the elders give to anyone who disagrees with the ancestral teachings, but it's not entirely accurate. we haven't abandoned logic. we've simply learned to exist without the need to continually repress our emotions. it's taken years of experimentation, but we've managed to find a balance between the two. that's not possible. here we are. logic is an essential part of vulcan existence. but it has to complement emotions, not exclude them. you must know a great deal about emotion. you live on a human starship. that's not something that many vulcans would be comfortable with. i am here as an observer. i'm sorry. i didn't mean to offend you. i'm not capable of feeling offense. my chief engineer tells me your repairs are going to take three or four days. we were going to use that time to explore the nebula, if you don't mind tagging along. not at all. mm. i've never seen an engine this far gone. we're going to have to swap out every plasma relay in your reactor. there are a lot of women on your ship. nearly a third of the crew. is it true you mate year-round with any of them you choose? you haven't been around humans too much, have you? you are the first we've met. but i've heard a lot of stories. your people indulge their passions. do you really eat six meals a day? more like three. and what about sleep? i understand you spend more than half the day in bed. eight hours. we sleep for eight hours. in my case, about six. oh. when we're through here, maybe we can get a bite to eat. i might be able to clear up some of your, um... misconceptions. i'd like that, commander. eh, call me trip. they've asked for any medical supplies we can spare and a thousand liters of plasma coolant. well, that shouldn't be a problem. tavin has also requested the recipe for chicken marsala. tell him chef's recipes are usually classified, but we'll make an exception in this case. i thought... you'd be spending a little more time getting to know our guests. i've been busy. seems to me like... you've been busy avoiding them. i can understand that you might not approve of what they're trying to do, but... for all we know, they're onto something. that's unlikely. is it. eight years. that's a pretty good track record. just because they smile and eat chicken doesn't mean they've learned to master their emotions. maybe i'm just relieved to finally meet some vulcans who aren't giving me a hard time. then again... if they have found this balance... they're not the first ones to attempt this, captain. others have tried to reintegrate their emotions. they all failed. what they're doing is dangerous. unless my instincts are way off, they don't seem very dangerous to me. but i... could be wrong. i can't order you to spend time with them, but i would encourage you to keep an open mind. so this is the mess hall. it is. the crew must not have much of an appetite. most of them are asleep. it's quite late. could you show me how to operate this? what would you like? i'm not sure. i don't have much experience with human food. what's that? mint tea. that'll be fine. mint tea. hot. thank you. it has a lot of flavor. you can try something else. no, it's fine. i'm just surprised. do you like the taste? their selection of vulcan beverages is limited. but it can make vulcan tea. yes. interesting. unless you need further assistance... how long have you lived among humans? i spent two years at the vulcan consulate on earth, and seven months on enterprise. that's a long time away from home. living here has obviously affected you in ways that you don't realize. you may be right. on occasion, i also drink chamomile tea. and you have a sense of humor. a concept that most vulcans can't seem to grasp. you are easily amused. there's that humor again. i'm curious... why do you stay here? captain archer needs a science officer. is that the only reason? maybe you're more attached to these people than you'd care to admit. what makes you say that? your emotions are much closer to the surface than other vulcans. they're easier to read. i've yet to mediate this evening. perhaps that's what you're sensing. this may surprise you, but we still meditate. the balance between emotion and logic requires constant discipline. so you've said. you and your colleagues have chosen a reckless path. have we? history's shown that vulcans who attempt to embrace their emotions often revert to their primal nature. that's a myth. propaganda from 5,000 years ago. our primal nature, t'pol, is not as dangerous as you think. commander tucker suggests that i try something called ""pizza."" would you care to join me? i've already eaten. another time, perhaps. is it what you imagined, sir? pictures don't do it justice. it's big. over eight billion kilometers in diameter. eight billion? are you sure? according to sensors. my astronomy book said it was only 6. we'll have to send our readings to the publisher, so they can put out a revised edition. how long would it take to chart that thing? several weeks. my vessel is equipped with translinear sensors. we could help you complete the survey a good deal quicker. we should have someone on your ship to monitor the data. would you mind working from there? no. glad you dropped by. take us in, travis. look at that. i've never seen anything so beautiful. you'd probably consider that an emotional reaction. not necessarily. it is aesthetically pleasing. ""pleasing""? coming from you, that's practically an outburst. it's curious that people who reject surak's teachings would display his likeness. we don't reject his teachings. we simply disagree with how they're interpreted. have you read his original text? he never intended for us to purge our emotions. he wanted us to master them, and then carefully integrate them into our lives. i doubt many would agree with you. that doesn't mean we're wrong. what did you do on vulcan before you left? i taught literature at the shirkar academy. you gave up a great deal to wander the galaxy in a transport. i don't have any regrets. i always knew there had to be more to life than just logic and reason. haven't you ever felt that way? not recently. but you did once? once. i should take these readings back to enterprise. t'pol... ...you said that you meditated each night. tonight... don't. see what happens. i think you'll find your dreams will be far more interesting. you're a scientist. consider it an experiment. where'd you hear that? a vulcan anthropologist told me he'd seen the ritual during an earth expedition. they're not trying to kill the quarterback. they're just trying to keep him from throwing the ball or running with it. it's only a game, not a fight to the death. i see. you must think we're a bunch of barbarians. your species does have a reputation, but i've always suspected the stories were exaggerated. well, i hope you'll tell all your friends... set the record straight. gladly. there's, uh... something i've always wondered about vulcans. maybe you could clear it up for me. please. it's kind of personal. go ahead. well, i've learned about your marriage customs, how your parents arrange the whole thing when you're young, stuff like that, but... what about...? you know. ah, you mean sex! it's not a topic i've heard vulcans discuss. well, we do have it, if that's what you're asking. am i interrupting anything? no. please join us, mister...? reed. malcolm reed. kov. we were just discussing vulcan mating rituals. oh. most of my people are extremely uncomfortable talking about such things. so many inhibitions. vulcan males are driven to mate once every seven years. seven years? frightening. over the past few years, we've been developing methods to accelerate the mating cycle. you up for seconds? i've had enough, thank you. back to work. a pleasure meeting you, mr. reed. likewise. sir, i'm picking up a transmission from echo iii. starfleet? it's admiral forrest. i'll take it in my ready room. admiral forrest. good to see you. you, too, jon. i understand you have guests. a vulcan crew. how'd you know? i got a call from ambassador soval about an hour ago. they're aware that you've docked with the vahklas and they have a favor to ask. a favor from me? a minister at the high command has a son on that ship... an engineer named kov. have you met him? i don't think so. well, apparently, the two of them had a falling out about nine, ten years ago. his father's tried to contact him several times since then, but kov won't respond. what do they want me to do? i hear these aren't your garden variety vulcans. can i assume you're on friendly terms? yes. kov's father is dying, jon. he'd like to speak with his son. maybe you can encourage him somehow. i'll see what i can do. the high command let you keep your science officer. it wouldn't hurt to return the favor. understood. keep me posted. our primal nature isn't as dangerous as you think. do you like the taste? you must have learned a great deal about emotion. why do you stay here? hmm... this is more than a simple headache. your blood pressure's elevated, and i'm reading unusually high synaptic activity. it doesn't appear to be a virus or a bacterial infection. i'd like to run a cranial scan just to be safe. that won't be necessary. it'll only take a moment. i believe i can explain my symptoms. last night, i neglected to meditate before i went to sleep. as a result, i awoke feeling... agitated. all i need is an injection of inaprovaline. 25 milligrams should suffice. very well, ""doctor."" it's, uh, not like you to stray from your routine. this wouldn't have anything to do with our visitors? you've been spending quite a bit of time on their ship. i've become... acquainted with one of them. he suggested that my dreams might be more interesting if i didn't meditate. and? he was wrong. they were unsettling. it was a foolish thing to do. nothing that a little, uh, inaprovaline can't cure. i can understand why you'd be intrigued by their philosophy. maybe you shouldn't be so quick to dismiss it after one bad experience. there are too many risks. it would be unwise to continue. you're probably right. but, uh, if you do decide to experiment further, keep in mind that they've been working on this for a number of years. you've only known them for two days. go slowly, hmm? thank you, doctor. come in. captain. please have a seat. the repairs to our propulsion system are going well. mr. tucker's been very helpful. that's good to hear. is there a problem? i called you here to pass along a message... from your father. you spoke with him? actually, it came through a vulcan ambassador. i'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but your father is... very ill. he wants you to contact him as soon as possible. if you'd like, my com officer can arrange the transmission. it's a kind offer, but i'll deal with this myself. thanks for the message. i know it's none of my business, but... do you plan on contacting him? the last time i spoke with my father, he said i'd brought shame to 15 generations of our family. he's dying, kov. if it isn't too much trouble, would you please send a message back for me? tell him that we said good-bye a long time ago. good morning. chamomile? thank you. how did it go? the lateral sensors were out of alignment. i haven't had a chance to scan the disodium layer. i mean last night. did you take my advice? yes. and your dreams? i'd rather not discuss them. it will get easier. tonight will be less disturbing. i plan to resume meditating tonight. you can't give up after one trial. it was a mistake to try in the first place. wasn't there anything enjoyable about the experience? i'm reading over 20 million cubic meters of disodium, as well as traces of ethylchlorate. we can run the scans later. tell me about your dreams. your emotions were closer to the surface. it must have been intense. it involved a memory. i was walking down a street in san francisco... on earth. why did you leave the compound? i was curious about human recreation. i wanted to see it for myself. so you broke protocol? it was late; everyone in the compound had gone to sleep. i didn't see any harm in leaving for a couple of hours. where did you go? i simply walked... then i heard music. music? it was unusual, chaotic, but i was drawn to it. go on. i went into a restaurant... where musicians were playing. i sat at a table. how did you feel? i can't remember. try. i felt... invigorated. emotion. you felt emotion. briefly. they finished playing and i returned to the compound. you could feel that way again, t'pol. it isn't difficult and it's nothing to be afraid of. i can show you how. you want me to talk to him? from what i hear, you've become fast friends. maybe you'll have better luck than i did. well, i'll try, but something tells me, it won't be as simple as fixing an engine. he's got a lot of resentment. do your best. aye, sir. what about this tolaris fellow? well, i haven't really gotten to know him. he seems kind of quiet, though. a little sullen. t'pol's been spending a lot of time with him lately. is that a problem? two days ago, she couldn't wait to get these people off the ship. i practically had to order her to work with him, now... they're almost inseparable. if i didn't know better, i'd say you were a little jealous. if i was the only human on a ship full of vulcans and we ran into an earth vessel, i'd be spending as much time with them as i could. she likes being around her own kind. who doesn't? well, let me know how it goes with kov. yes, sir. ""mind-meld""? it's an ancient technique. it was abandoned centuries ago. but we've discovered that it can help us access our emotions. how does it work? i'd begin by creating a telepathic link... we would be able to share our, our memories, thoughts... in essence, we would become one mind. it's quite an experience, but... it is profoundly intimate. are you prepared for that? if you'd like, we could try a more traditional form of guided meditation, but it wouldn't be nearly as effective. proceed. it's all right. close your eyes. try to focus on my voice. my mind to your mind. your thoughts to my thoughts. our minds are merging. our minds are becoming one. it's not working. you're resisting. relax. my mind to your mind. your thoughts to my thoughts. our minds are merging. our minds are becoming one. am i with you? yes. can you sense my thoughts? yes. you're doing well. i want you to think about that night when you left the compound. imagine yourself walking down that street. good. now listen. can you hear the music? listen. now follow it. i can see why you were drawn to this place. it's unlike anything on vulcan. i'm not surprised it triggered an emotional response. you said you were invigorated... what else? i don't know. yes, you do. you're just not used to describing your emotions. you experienced other things. excitement about breaking protocol, apprehension about getting caught, and the music... the music made you feel... elated. allow yourself to feel these emotions again. don't hold them back. i have to return to the compound. you're anxious. it's just another emotion. let me go. stay with me, t'pol. no! stop. no. stop! this was a mistake. you've made progress. don't give up now. please go. t'pol... leave! you're feeling anger. your emotions are breaking the surface. embrace them! what a shame. t'pol to sick bay. i've already been through this with your captain. are you sure you're making the right decision? if you knew my father, you'd understand. i don't mean to put too fine a point on this, but you've got a limited window of opportunity. once it closes... i consider you a friend, trip, and i appreciate what you're trying to do, but please don't. i have no intention of contacting him. i test-fired our port thruster last night. it's still off by 12 percent. oh, probably a faulty injector. should be easy enough to fix. do vulcans dance? you know... oh. only when it's part of some tedious ceremony. hmm. i remember the first dance i ever went to. bayshore elementary, panama city, florida. a girl i had a crush on, melissa lyles, was going to be there. so i spent weeks practicing the two-step with my brother. i wanted to... make sure i was ready. she was wearing a red dress that night. prettiest girl there. all i wanted to do was ask her to dance with me. but i never worked up the courage to go over and talk to her. i caught her looking at me a couple times, but... i ended up just standing in a corner with my buddies. interesting. but what does that have to do with our thruster problem? it's been more than 20 years and i'm still kicking myself for not asking that girl to dance. you probably don't know this, but... regret is one of the strongest emotions. and... one of the saddest. i have a feeling you haven't had a brush with it yet. but it sounds to me like... you're pretty close. it's something you might want to avoid. come in. good morning. morning. can i get you something? coffee? no, thanks. have a seat. trip tells me the repairs to your ship are almost finished. you should be on your way pretty soon. yes. how's that survey coming along? we'll be done this afternoon. that's great news. i wanted to thank you for all of your help. it was the least we could do. besides, we've enjoyed spending our time here. you have an exceptional crew, captain. starfleet's finest. sleep well last night? well enough. you? tossed and turned. always happens whenever we're exploring... someplace new. i understand. well, if there's nothing more, captain, i'm eager to get back to work. we have another 20 million cubic kilometers to chart. sorry to keep you. i'm... afraid you'll be working alone today. oh? subcommander t'pol's in sick bay. from what the doctor tells me, she's in pretty bad shape. that's unfortunate. what happened? you know damn well what happened. she told me about your... what did she call it?... mind-meld. she said when she asked you to stop, you got angry. she said she had to force you away. what happened between us is personal. it's not your concern. you assaulted a member of my crew. i did no such thing. mind-melds can be emotionally turbulent. she simply panicked. panic doesn't land you in sick bay. our doctor said she could have suffered neurological damage, thanks to you. no one forced her to try the meld. she did it willingly. you've been manipulating her ever since you came aboard. i am helping her shed a lifetime of repression. and you, of all people, should understand what i'm trying to do. you're human. i need to go see her. t'pol's had enough of your help. stay away from her. she is in a crucial stage of her awakening. she needs guidance. i told you, it's over. i think that's for her to decide. maybe i'm not making myself clear. sick bay's off-limits. you're in my way, captain. you'd be wise to let me leave. what's wrong, tolaris? getting angry? i thought you had that under control. move aside. t'pol's right... you've got a temper. now! go to hell. you planned this. if i'd known i was going to get thrown across the room that hard, i might have tried a different approach. i think it's time you and your friends went on your merry way. keep an eye on the intermix pressure. don't let it drift above 5,000. 5,000. and watch those injector ports. i will. i thought you'd like to know, i got an update on my father. apparently, his condition's improved. is that so? the surgeons implanted a vaso-stimulator. they say, with any luck, it'll extend his life a few years. i'm glad to hear it. that'll give you a little more time to think about... making that call. i already did. my father's the one who gave me the good news. thank you, trip. anytime. come in. is this a bad time? not at all. feeling any better? has the vulcan ship left? about 20 minutes ago. then yes, i'm feeling better. you do this every night? every night. i think... i finally understand why. i'll see you in the morning. captain. do you... dream? sure. sometimes they're even in color. is it enjoyable? most nights. i envy you. good night."
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"where else can you get raw slug liver in the morning? - what's this? - what do you mean? it's puree of beetle. - i didn't order it. - course not. you don't need to. you have it after work every morning. well, i'm not having it this morning. i'd like... two eggs, three strips of bacon and a side of corned beef hash. - what kind of breakfast is that? - chief o'brien's breakfast of choice. that's the problem with working with humans - you pick up their disgusting habits. bacon... corned beef hash. what's next, rom? orange juice and coffee? that might be nice. i don't understand. you gave up a perfectly good job with me to work on the station's waste extraction system? a good waste extraction system is important. of course it is but my point is, you're not getting the choice assignments. o'brien's got you on the night shift, doing all the work nobody else wants to do. i like my work. you like standing all night long knee-deep in waste, fixing some broken flow regulator, when you could be here staring at half-naked dabo girls? i have a good job. i'm proud of the work i do. and i know that one day chief o'brien will recognise my efforts and reward me with a position of respect and responsibility. and why? because that's just the way things are in engineering. i'm sorry i brought it up. - they don't look so fine now. - i followed keiko's instructions. they were dry as a bone yesterday. i watered them but maybe not enough. you watered them? these are idran hybrids. too much water rots their roots. mummy's going to be mad. keiko's gone five days and we kill her plants. she'll understand. they're just plants. they're not just plants. these are her bonsai trees. she's cared for them, nurtured them and sculpted their growth for months... - years. - you're in trouble. molly, i think we should both go to the airlock and welcome mummy back. and then after we've hugged and kissed, - you can tell her what happened. - not me. - don't look at me. - you killed her plants. we killed them. but you're overreacting. - she'll forgive you. it's your birthday. - it's one i want to forget. she's been away on bajor. she's missed you. bring her a gift. - what chocolates does she like? - tellurian mint truffles. - you should be with me. - you don't need me there. you've handled your wife thousands of times. just say you take full responsibility. you'll be fine. besides, i have to be in surgery... operating. - on who? - i'll find someone. it was julian. he was trying to be helpful. he over-watered them. it's not his fault. you know how he is. sometimes he doesn't even know what he's doing. i'm sorry, sweetheart. we'll buy some new ones. - forget it, miles. they're just plants. - exactly. it's not as if something happened to molly or the baby. i mean, everybody's fine. no problems. good. what about kira? is she back yet? no, she's still with shaakar, travelling around dahkur province. - i thought you'd visit them. - i didn't get a chance. - how were the fire caves? - fine. and now it's time for me to tell you some news. i'm not keiko. no? who are you? listen carefully, miles. i have taken possession of your wife's body. i will hold it hostage until you do everything i tell you to, accurately, and without question. everything? if you don't do precisely what i ask i'll kill your wife. are you all right? maybe there's been an outbreak of rudellian brain fever. i'm going to have to give you a demonstration of my sincerity. keiko! keiko! no! no. you're not telling anyone. if you do, i'll stop her heart forever. if you're really in control my wife's body, let me speak to her. - she can hear you. - not good enough. i want to talk to her. i want her to talk to me. you're in no position to bargain. strange, these corporeal bodies of yours. so fragile. burst even a tiny blood vessel in the brain and every memory, every passionate emotion, gone forever. you shouldn't let me eat these by myself. i'm not hungry. tell me what to do to end this. - very well. - but let me make one thing clear: i will not do anything to jeopardise this station. don't worry. all i want you to do is reconfigure some of the communication relays. - why? - i can't tell you. you'll have to be patient. those relays are distributed throughout the station. you know your wife well, miles, but she knows you even better. you're playing for time until you can get to julian, dax, captain sisko. the captain may even allow you to do what i'm asking, at least until someone figures out a way to catch me in a stasis field or some other clever device you're already dreaming up. and it might work. you might be able to stop me. but i promise you one thing: if you do, keiko will die. all i need is a split second to cause a massive brain haemorrhage, and... she's gone. i know this is difficult for you but we don't have a lot of time. what do you want me to do? how long is this going to take? to keep the polarity shift invisible to security checks, i'll have to tap into the optronic integrator on level 5. you're the engineer. what is it, miles? what do you want to ask me? you tighten your brow when you're about to ask a question. only a wife would notice. why take control of keiko? why not me? i'm the one who can do the work. come in. i hope i'm not interrupting. - yes, you are. we're busy. - miles, don't be so rude. bajoran spiny basil! how thoughtful. it's the least i could do after... it's all right. i forgive you. are you coming to the party tonight? i'll be here. i guess it's not a surprise anymore? i can't believe i did that. i arranged a birthday dinner for you but i wanted it to be a surprise. that's ok. i don't like surprises. i'd better be going. i left a patient on the operating table. - i'll see you later. - thanks, julian. this was so sweet. no problem. - a party? tonight? - it is your birthday. we have to cancel. and raise suspicions? it's better if the dinner goes on as planned. keiko went to a lot of trouble to arrange it. you better get to work. don't be late for your shift briefing. and i've got a lot of cooking to do. diagnostic and repair technician rom reporting. you're duarte's replacement. have a seat. - i'm on the swing shift? - for a day or two. - what's the matter with duarte? - sick as a vole. is this where duarte sits? what are you drinking? - raktajino. - great. is that what we drink on the swing shift? - drink anything you want. - i'll have a raktajino. it's not like this on a night shift. we don't drink raktajino. - we really don't drink anything. - fascinating. change of plans today, people. i need to recalibrate the optronic integrator. - what is it, rom? - i volunteer. - i like phase-shifting reconfigurations. - ""'thank you but i'll take care of it.' the rest of you concentrate on the new inertial couplings. i want all 64 couplings done today. 'watley, you and tekoa cover the docking ring. 'abdon and nori, the cargo bays. rom, the upper pylons.' any questions? good. i'm going to be very busy today. i don't want to be interrupted by anything unimportant. is that clear? computer... locate keiko o'brien. 'keiko o'brien is in her quarters.' computer, initiate full identity scan of keiko o'brien and note any inconsistencies with existing medical records. 'scan complete. no inconsistencies found. identity confirmed.' how long would it take a level-3 stasis field to render her unconscious? 'all cognitive reflexes would cease in 2i seconds.' too long. calculate the time if anesthezine gas were used. '1.4 seconds.' - what about a phaser set on stun? - 0.9 seconds. damn. god help me. there you are. i thought you were going to miss your own party. - i'm sorry. have you seen keiko? - she's helping molly try on other shoes. as usual, your wife is handling everything. keiko has really outdone herself. take it from an old cook - q'parol is a very time-consuming dish. happy birthday, daddy! happy birthday, sweetheart. make a wish. single malt irish whiskey. neat. molly's wearing her new purple shoes for you. - doesn't she look pretty? - very. all the food's on the table so just relax and i'll pass these around. - i want to talk to you. - not right now. we have guests. - sorry i'm late. - i was afraid you weren't coming. i heard you were serving q'parol. how could i miss it? you look a little preoccupied. everything all right? there's something i forgot to tell keiko. - would you excuse me for a moment? - of course. - did you see any pah-wraiths? - pah-wraiths? odo said the fire caves were haunted by supernatural beings. don't tell me you believe in wraiths. i mentioned the bajoran legends about creatures living in the caves but i never said i believe in them. the only thing i saw were some beautiful and fascinating fungi. maybe the next time i could come along. i want to meet a pah-wraith. maybe you will. you never know. - i've done what you asked. - that's terrific. we'll talk later. - miles! are you bleeding? - no. it's nothing. - let me take a look. - i said i'm all right! i'm sorry. i'm sorry, everybody. excuse me. get a hold of yourself. i've done everything you asked me to. - just give me back my wife. - you've done well. but recalibrating the optronic integrator was only a test. i had to be sure i could trust you. tomorrow the real work begins. it's time to get back to our guests. we don't want to raise suspicions, do we? is molly asleep? yes. the q'parol was a huge success. no more tests, no more games. just tell me what you want done. we'll talk about it in the morning. you're working tomorrow. - i want to talk about it now! - miles, i make the rules. now relax. everything's going to be fine as long as you do what i ask. - i'll sleep on the couch. - don't be childish. what if molly has a nightmare and runs in? you'll sleep in bed with me just like you always do. i'll be there in a minute. don't be too late. you've got a busy day tomorrow. computer... give me the record of all bajoran legends concerning the pah-wraiths. there are 6,427 entries in the data banks that reference that subject. please specify. miles? sleep well. another weakness of corporeal life-forms - your need for physical intimacy. it's especially irritating in your young. - i have to get molly ready. - i'll do it. you have a big day ahead. molly is going to stay at the davis' until this is over. is that wise? a little girl needs her mother. - molly would be lost without hers. - stay away from her. i'd never do anything to hurt your daughter... unless you forced me to. these are your instructions. follow them precisely. computer, locate captain sisko. 'captain sisko is in security.' miles! no! you didn't see anyone near her before she fell? nobody. but i was underneath the walkway and i had my back toward her. what were you doing there? weren't you supposed to be working on level 5? i was going to the replimat for lunch. keiko will be all right. the way she landed distributed the impact. she could have been killed or left paralysed. - is she conscious? - yes, but she's in shock. she has a broken femur and a fracture of the right parietal lobe. - can i see her? - in a couple of hours. right now she needs to rest. - i really need to see her now. - doctor. all right. but only for a few minutes. don't excite her. keiko. - you were going to tell them about me. - how did you know? i know everything your wife knows and she knows you. i told you we have to trust one another. you violated that trust. now look where it's led us. - i want my wife back, do you hear? - then stop trying to fool me. how much more damage do you think this body can take? no more tricks. agreed? say it. - agreed. - good. you know what you need to do. you should get back to work. - i'll have it completed in 36 hours. - you have 13. - i can't do it that fast. - you're a very resourceful man. i'm sure you can find a way... for keiko's sake. you bloody... she does need to rest, chief. tell molly i'll be home soon. tell her mummy's fine. don't scare her. miles? give me a kiss. i'm counting on you. she'll be back on her feet soon, i promise. computer, begin a 13-hour countdown. - 'clock activated.' - chief. i heard about keiko's accident. how is she? julian said she'll be home soon. that is good. if there is anything i can do... i wish there was. i really do. i'd better go. i'm falling behind schedule. computer, time remaining? '8 hours, 22 minutes, 3 seconds.' chief! sorry. i didn't mean to startle you. - what are you doing here? - reporting for my next assignment. i've completed calibration tests on the inertial coupling ports. already? how did you finish so quickly? i just did the work. i didn't get caught up in any of the distracting discussions the other workers engage in. ferengi can be very focused, especially when no one talks to them. - i see. - it's ok. i'm used to being ignored. is something wrong, chief? i can work slower if you want me to. rom, i need your help and i need you to keep your mouth shut. - can i count on you? - is that a trick question? - this is serious. - you can depend on me. we're going to make some modifications to the station's systems. i don't want you to breathe a word of this to anyone. that includes dax, odo, captain sisko, worf... - they don't know? - of course they know. at least some of them do. but they have to pretend that they don't. this is a top secret starfleet operation. culpable deniability. i understand. don't worry about me. my lips are sealed. nobody will get anybody out of me. not even my name. rom, everybody on the station knows your name. right. but i won't confirm it. where do we start? computer, time remaining? '6 hours, 41 minutes, 26 seconds.' chief? - what are you doing up at this hour? - i want you to look at something. i couldn't sleep so i scanned the wormhole for radiometric anomalies. at 3:00 in the morning? i find anomalies very relaxing. it's a curse. i was using the wideband filter protocols and when i ran the primary calibrations check, i found this. they're slightly off spec. i thought it might be a fused matrix inverter until i ran a level-3 diagnostic. have a look. we'd better wake the captain. we have a saboteur on the station. all right, what have we got? computer, display diagnostic. chief? we've identified 943 tiny fluctuations in the primary communication relays and several power distribution junctions. they can only be attributed to external intervention. someone's altering our systems. for what purpose? we're working on that. at this point, it's hard to even call it sabotage. there's been no real damage. the systems are just off spec. these alterations don't seem to pose any threat to the station. so far. but this might be just the tip of a large and dangerous iceberg. can we trace how this was done and by whom? it has to be someone familiar with the systems. someone who worked here before? i'm running security checks on visitors but i haven't found anything. maybe someone who's been here a long time, someone with a lot of access. - maybe someone from maintenance. - chief? - yes? - yes, what? do you think it's someone on your staff? 'chief o'brien, i have a call from your daughter.' go ahead. - honey, what is it? - mummy told me i could call you. i hope we didn't interrupt anything. it's all right, molly. i'm glad you called. - what are you doing at home? - she missed her mummy. sweet! when are you going to come...? ow! that hurt! 'i'm sorry, sweetie.' - all you all right, molly? - she's fine. i told her you had to work another 2 hours, 22 minutes and 13 seconds. how long is that, daddy? soon. i'll be home very soon. good. we both miss you. - everything all right? - fine. sorry about that. you said you thought you knew who the saboteur might be. i think i have an idea. hello, constable. hello, chief. - what are you doing, rom? - i can't talk about it. yes, you can. and you will. - coming? - i'd better see what he's done. i'll take care of those. - has he said anything? - not much. for 40 minutes, it was like pulling teeth getting him to admit his name. - you think he's working alone? - he admits to nothing. now he's saying he'll only talk to chief o'brien. then get the chief down here. i want to know what's going on. security to chief o'brien. -'go ahead.' - we need you in security. i'm still trying to figure out what rom did here. ""that will have to wait. i have orders to get you down here.' on my way. computer, time remaining? '36 minutes, 9 seconds.' computer, locate maintenance technician rom. 'maintenance technician rom is in holding cell number 4. initiate security override and scramble surveillance channels 4-a, b, c and d. - authorisation o'brien 7-1-2. - 'security channels scrambled.' now begin recalibration of gravitic sensors at access panel 3-7-9 as indicated. i'll be back in ten minutes. the chief is here, rom. what do you want to say? alone. i'll only talk if we're alone. what is it, rom? it's ok. i've disconnected odo's eavesdropping devices. i haven't told anyone anything, just like you said. you're a good man. now why did you call me? we're under tight time constraints. captain sisko is really angry. if i didn't know he was pretending... don't worry. i can hold out until you say otherwise. but there is one thing i have to know. go ahead. why are we focusing a chroniton beam at the wormhole? what? the new frequency of the deflector grid will make the station a massive chroniton array aimed at the wormhole. so i just wanted to know... why are we trying to kill the wormhole aliens? what are you talking about? the chroniton beam is harmless. to us. but its temporal disruption would kill a wormhole alien instantly. of course. why didn't i think of that? - she has me so on edge i can't think. - who's she? i don't have time to explain now. the question is... why would anyone want to kill the wormhole aliens? everyone has enemies. even the prophets. that's right. they're not just wormhole aliens, they're prophets, part of bajoran mythology... just like the pah-wraiths of the fire caves. so... what have those wraiths got to do with the wormhole aliens? - koss'moran. - what? it's a bajoran legend. from the verb kosst, meaning ""to be"", and amoran - banished. leeta's been telling me all about bajoran legends. - she says i'm a good listener. - i'm sure you are. now be good talker. go on. according to leeta, the pah-wraiths used to live in the wormhole. they were part of the celestial temple. - they were prophets. - false prophets. they were cast out of the temple, exiled to the caves, where they were imprisoned and forbidden to ever return lest they face the wrath of the true prophets. so if they were to return to the celestial temple... - they wouldn't be welcomed. - unless she kills the wormhole aliens. rom... i'm going to have to leave you in a tough spot. captain sisko, odo - they don't know about any of this, do they? no, they don't. - keep it that way for a little longer. - i have to stay and play the idiot? i'm afraid so. no matter what odo asks you... i'm quark's brother. i know the role. computer, time remaining? '12 minutes, 22 seconds.' sorry to disturb you. couple of things are still bothering me. rom couldn't have done all this sabotage alone. there were too many changes for one person to make. maybe. now i've got a frequency problem in the cascade feeder. i checked with the repair logs. i was hoping to match someone's movements to the locations where the alterations were made. - but i couldn't do that. - we had a matrix systems failure. those files were lost. sorry. we've had a lot of systems failures recently. i hadn't noticed. i've been too busy. like the surveillance channels in the holding cells? you authorised a security override. what was wrong with them? the fibre optic relay was out of sync. the isolinear... enough, chief. you didn't cover your tracks very well. why? i didn't have time. i still don't. sorry, odo. - chief o'brien to keiko. - 'this is keiko"" i've finished but we have to move quickly. this place will be swarming with security. meet me at runabout pad c now. - 'how do you know i want a runabout?' - i know what you're planning. but i don't care about your non-corporeal feuds. i just want my wife back. you need me to pilot you through the wormhole. so let's stop wasting time. agreed? 'i'll meet you there... that's correct, commander. i want to test some new constrictors in the runabout's thrusters. 'very well, chief. you're cleared for departure. 'but there's one thing i'd like to ask you.' - what's that? - did you enjoy your birthday? it was full of surprises. 'good. those are always my favourites.' hold position here. computer, initiate modifications o'brien 7-3-1 - and enable remote comlink. - 'comlink enabled.' what the hell? target the centre of the wormhole. - target coordinates set. - have us face the temple. the blast will last a fraction of a second. they'll be dead before they even see it. you have no idea how long i waited for this. let's get on with it! you have a lot to learn about patience. proceed. 'chief, what's going on out there? 'i'm ordering you to return to the station. now.' activate. keiko! keiko. miles? chief. you have some explaining to do. it was more like having something coiled around inside my head. i could see and hear through it but anytime i tried to do anything... ...it was like being stuck in sand and squeezed. - could you sense any of its thoughts? - just feelings sometimes. kind of a cold rage. it had no any intention of leaving either one of us alive. - you don't have to talk about it. - it feels better to talk about it. besides, i don't want to forget how hard you fought for me. - hello, brother. - you look horrible. i'm telling you, working the night shift - is driving you to an early grave. - i wasn't working. - what do you mean? - i'm not on the night shift. i knew it. o'brien fired you. no, brother. in appreciation of my work, the chief... has promoted me to the day shift. he says i have a promising future. - why do you look so tired? - i was celebrating. - with who? - my crewmates. - i think they like me. - do they? especially litana. she's always talking to me. well, rom... i'm glad things are going so well. no, you're not. but thanks anyway, brother. i guess you'll be wanting the ""chief's special"" again? no. bacon doesn't agree with me. what a surprise. i'll have a short stack of pancakes, dripping with butter, a side of sausage and... pineapple. pineapple? that's the breakfast of choice on the day shift. pineapple. english"
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"good evening, fellow gourmet. have you ever been in a position where the success or failure of a dinner party depended entirely on you? of course all this is not without its compensations. it is always reassuring to learn that other human beings still find you desirable. and i am the main course. it would be horrible to go through this and be nothing but an hors d'oeuvre. confidentially, they are miserable chefs. i certainly would never cook a pot roast with its shoes on. actually, i still haven't explained why i'm here. it seems that one of the natives was condemned to death and as a last request was granted the right to indulge in a hearty meal. i'm proud to say i was his first choice. and now, while i'm coming to a boil, suppose you watch tonight's story which is also about a condemned man. he's all yours, mike. never mind the bald job. you'd better let him do it, daniels. there aren't going to be any women no. just a bunch of vultures watching me die for a killing daniels, daniels. you've only got a few hours left. why don't you spend them with the chaplain? let dr. raymond's wife spend them with him. i was with her at the time of the killing she's a respectable woman. are you kidding? respectable? she lied. she's letting me die to protect her precious reputation. if you want to talk to somebody, go talk to her. now, get them out of here, all of them. don't i get a last request? yes. you have the right to anything reasonable. i want a typewriter and some paper. i want to write a letter, and i'll need a special messenger ""to the editor of the star times, ""tomorrow morning your newspaper will carry the story of my execution, ""an execution for a murder i did not commit. ""along with that story, i would like you to publish this letter. ""i want the public to know that the district attorney, ""a fact that i have known since first i met him five years ago ""when a detective picked me up at the airport and took me to his office. "" what's the idea of this? what's the roust? gerald daniels, isn't it? from cleveland? you know it is. now, why did this goon pick me up? because i wanted to talk to you, i want to tell you something about our city. it's a big city but a nice one, a clean one. we'd like to keep it that way. i never do anything illegal. you've been arrested five times on bunco charges? but no indictments and no convictions. yeah, that's right. because the victim is always a woman, a married woman who is afraid to press charges. either that or some other woman for an alibi, some sweet trusting thing who swears you weren't there so women like me and i like them. you got a law against that? no. but you're like all men who like too many women. somewhere inside of you, you hate them. but someday, mister, you're going to run into and she's gonna finish you. hey, what are you, anyhow? a d.a. or a psychiatrist? maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea for you to see one. well, if you hear of a pretty one, let me know. maybe i can solve some of her problems. finished? yeah. but if i ever have to come for you, i'll get an indictment i promise you. now, get out. ""and that was my first meeting with the man ""whose ambition it is to be governor of this state. ""it makes him sound like a man who keeps his promises, doesn't it? ""he got an indictment, he got a conviction, ""and i'm going to die. ""but i'm going to die because of his mistakes ""i knew him for what he was ""and i knew women for what they were and are.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"major, you have an incoming transmission from a... razka karn. he claims to be an old friend. put him through. razka. it's been a while. how's business? i miss the old days on bajor. smuggling might not have been safe, but it was more exciting than selling scrap metal. what's on your mind, razka? i picked up a lead on the ravinok. - like the last time? - last time it was just a rumour. this time i've got evidence - a fragment of metal. maybe part of the forward sensor array. can you bring it here for analysis? sorry. i can't leave the badlands right now. - important business. you understand. - tholians are after you again. let's just say it would be better if you came to me. it's been six years. even if you have found a piece, there may not be any survivors. there's only one way for you to find out. i'll be waiting. and item number 17, trelos vren was arrested outside of the klingon restaurant. he's being held for petty theft. trelos vren... where have i heard that name? we arrested him once for attempted break-in. - and now he's pick-pocketing? - without much success. still, i suppose you should admire him for his persistence. that was a joke. i'm sorry, odo. i may have a lead on the ravinok. i know what you're going to say. it's been six years. odds are everyone is dead. that is not what i was going to say. - i was going to say ""good luck"". - good luck? - you had a friend aboard the ravinok. - lorit akrem. which means it doesn't matter if you or i think there are any survivors. you're going to go looking for that ship and all i can say is good luck. and i hope you find them. come in. captain. you here to see me off? i'm afraid not. i'd like for you to postpone your trip. what's wrong? the cardassians got wind of your plan to search for the ravinok. they've asked permission to send someone with you. - and you said yes? - i said i'd talk to you about it. the ravinok was a cardassian ship. carrying bajoran prisoners. i'm not stopping anyone from looking. but why do have to come with me? the request came from the leader of the new government. nerys, i know this isn't what you had in mind. but bajor and cardassia must learn to work together... ...and that means cooperating on missions like these. all right. just tell them if their representative isn't here within 52 hours, i'm going alone. i'll be sure they get the message. did you and kasidy have a nice time last night? i just wish she wasn't leaving tomorrow. - you two are getting serious. - i don't know. i don't think kasidy is serious. - ben! - kasidy! - we were just talking about you. - i don't mean to interrupt. i won't be leaving tomorrow after all. that's good news. that's great. how long are you going to be here? that depends on whether i get this new job. i've applied for a job with the bajoran ministry of commerce to captain a freighter. - you'll work for the bajorans? - if we can hammer out an agreement. it's a great opportunity. i get to use my own ship, pick my own crew, and i never have to leave this sector. - where are you going to live? - on my ship. why don't you stay here? i'm sure benjamin could arrange some quarters. that's not a bad idea. yeah. i have a meeting on bajor and the shuttle leaves in a few minutes. i'll see you tonight? that answers that. she's serious. captain, the cardassian transport rabol is approaching the station, requesting permission to beam their representative to ops. someone's in a big hurry. - permission granted. - aye, sir. ah. major kira. i'm ready to leave whenever you are. we'll be crossing into the badlands in about six hours. - very good, major. - dukat, this is my mission. you're here because i agreed to let you come. when i give an order, i expect you to follow it. i want this mission to be concluded as quickly and as efficiently as possible, and i leave the details in your capable hands. good. then we shouldn't have any problems. why did the cardassian government send you? the ravinok was under my general command. it is my duty to try to find my troops. the question is, what are you doing here, major? i knew someone aboard the ravinok. one of the prisoners, i assume? - lorit akrem. - i see. so you're here for personal reasons. - is there something wrong with that? - not at all. when one has a difficult job to do... ...personal reasons can be quite an incentive. so who was he? a family member, a compatriot... a lover? lorit recruited me into the shakaar resistance cell. the infamous shakaar resistance. we never could eliminate that little group of yours. and it was not from lack of trying. i hope you don't take this the wrong way, major, but i've always admired you. you are the embodiment of the new bajor, a bajoran born out of the ashes of the occupation. a bajoran tempered with cardassian steel. captain sisko's right. you are in love with the sound of your own voice. i know you find this hard to accept but... i believe that in some ways the occupation actually helped bajor. which part? the massacres or the strip mining? i have no desire to debate the merits of the occupation with you. i'll even admit we were harsh in our methods. but the bajoran people are stronger now than they have been in centuries. when we arrived, you were a weak, contemplative race, choking on your isolation. now you have a new confidence, a whole new sense of purpose, not to mention a key role in the future of this entire quadrant. all of which bajor accomplished in spite of the cardassians, - not because of them. - think what you must. but i believe the time will come when cardassia and bajor will grow to be not only allies... ...but also close friends. bajor and cardassia, maybe. you and me... i doubt it. just have an open mind. all right, dukat, that's enough. i would like to spend the next six hours in silent meditation. - is that a request or an order? - whatever it takes. in that case, as much as it pains me... we both might survive this trip after all. they didn't wait for the interview to be over. after 20 minutes, minister azin said she'd heard enough and if i wanted the job, it was mine. - what did you tell them? - what do you think? i said yes. congratulations. that's it? that's not what i meant. - i want to know how you feel about it. - oh, i... i think it's great. we'll see a lot more of each other. you know, i was thinking about what dax said. maybe i should get quarters on the station. - that's a big step. - what does that mean? i just meant... it's a big step. a bad big step or a good big step? - a good one. - can you muster up more enthusiasm? i am enthusiastic. i'm proud of you. - this job... - forget the job. i'm talking about us. i tell you i'm thinking about living on the station and all you can say is, “it's a big step'? i don't think you took it the way i meant it. i don't think you know what you meant. but i do. you're afraid of commitment. - who mentioned commitment? - obviously not you. you know what? forget the whole thing. i'm not going to take the job. if you don't want me to stay here, that's fine with me. - how did you get this? - i bought it off a ferengi. it appears to be composed of uridium alloy. it's definitely cardassian. can you tell if it's from the ravinok? you didn't tell me you were bringing him. i didn't know i would be. the maquis would've paid handsomely to get their hands on him. and my government would be very happy to get its hands on you. razka karn, if i'm not mistaken. smuggler, thief, black marketeer. there are at least twelve outstanding warrants for your arrest on cardassia right now. but i suggest we ignore all that and try to cooperate with one another. the voice of the new cardassia - so compassionate, so understanding. almost makes you forget he worked bajorans to death in labour camps and shot anybody who tried to stop him. almost makes you forget. it's from the ravinok. no doubt about it. did the ferengi say where he found it? no, but i bribed a crew member. turns out his last trip was to the dozaria system. dozaria... i believe there is one class-m planet in that system. barely class-m. he found that in orbit. dozaria it is, then. thanks, razka. i owe you one. just let me know what you find out. lorit was my friend, too. how could the ravinok have gotten so far off course? dozaria's light years from where they should have been. some think that the ship was destroyed in an escape attempt by the bajoran prisoners. maybe. or they could have had a navigational problem or run into a subspace anomaly. hopefully, we'll find the truth. we're entering orbit. i'm reading severe ionic interference in the planet's atmosphere. sensors will be limited. i'm picking up a faint magneton signature. it could be residual radiation from a damaged warp nacelle. - shall we beam down? - no. the ionic interference will scatter our molecules around the planet. we'll have to do this the old-fashioned way. it's going to be a difficult landing. - i'll take the controls if you like. - that'll be the day. going in. invigorating, isn't it? a bit sunny, perhaps, but this heat feels wonderful. only a cardassian would call this invigorating. i forgot. compared to us, you bajorans are a bit fragile... physiologically speaking, of course. don't worry about me. the ravinok. - ""it's a big step.” that's all you said? - that's all. - you're sure? - positive. - what do you think? - it's definitely open to interpretation. but he could have said, ""it's a very big step."" you didn't say that, did you? - i don't think so. - that's good, anyway. what does he do now? he goes to kasidy, admits that everything was his fault and pledges his undying love. that's extreme. what if he tells her he made a mistake, and he really would like her to live on the station? could work. assuming that's what you want. captain, i would think long and hard before answering. i don't recall asking your opinion. who knows more about women than me? everyone. you humans. all you want to do is please your women. but we ferengi know better. women are the enemy and we treat them accordingly. the key is to never let them get the upper hand. if she says she doesn't see you enough, threaten to see her even less. if she wants more gifts, take back the ones you've already given her. - it's about control. - what if she leaves you? that's what holosuites are for. it's a wonder the ferengi reproduce at all. you never answered the question. do you want her to stay or not? i appreciate all the advice. i'll let you know how it turns out. just between you and me... ...what do you think about kasidy moving onto the station? - it's a big step. - a very big step. she didn't just crash. these are phaser hits. - looks like she put up quite a fight. - and paid for it. twelve graves. there were 18 crew members and 32 prisoners aboard. so where's everybody else? first things first. what are you doing? we need to identify these bodies. - i'll help. - no! our funeral rites are very strict. it would dishonour the dead for a non-cardassian to view the remains. there could be bajorans buried here, too. no doubt. but if my memory's correct, bajorans are much more concerned with the souls of the dead than they are with the physical remains. how did kai meressa put it? ""what remains after death is but a shell, ""a sign that the pagh has begun its final journey to the prophets."" please don't make this any more difficult for me than it already is. i should be able to identify the missing bajorans from the family imprint on the earrings. i should be able to get something from the ravinok's computers. you'll need the command codes. standard cardassian military codes from six years ago? yes. i got them from bajoran intelligence before we left. very good, major. very good. dukat. i was able to reactivate the... dukat. what was her name? i recognise a bajoran pledge bracelet when i see one. her name was tora... naprem. you see, major... you're not the only one... who had a friend aboard that ship. a friend? is that all she was? i see. you're not the only cardassian officer who kept a bajoran mistress. it wasn't like that. naprem and i... ...loved each other. the head of the occupation... ...in love with a bajoran? - ironic, isn't it? - did your wife know? no. and she's never going to find out. if you don't mind, major, i'd rather not talk about this right now. here are the earrings you wanted. if lorit's dead... ...he's not buried here. the computers say the ravinok was attacked by two unidentified warships. the attackers chased the ravinok here and made her crash-land. the survivors could have been taken away. or they could still be somewhere on this planet. maybe we should scan for them from orbit. too much ionic interference. the sensors wouldn't pick up their life signs. there may be another way. tricorder readings will only be about 12 metres, - but that should be enough. - for what? bajoran resistance fighters carried subdermal implants of tritonium isotopes. if they were captured they could activate the implant, which would leave a trail of isotopes so they could be tracked and rescued. i think i have something. - that way. - let's go. i don't know why we have to stop. for one thing, i can't see two metres in front of us. and we could both use the rest. so stop pacing and sit down. - what is it? - i don't know. i sat on something. let me see. ooh, get it out! - keep still and let me see. - get it out! - oh. this is going to hurt. - it already hurts. just take it out. if you say so. run this dermal regenerator over the wound. - this isn't funny! - it is from this angle. you know what's even funnier? this doesn't work! you... have to... activate it. oh! oh, yes. oh, much better. you probably should eat one of these. i haven't had field rations in a very long time. i'm sure they haven't improved a bit. actually, they've gotten a little worse. - tell me something. - what? who's tora ziyal? when i reactivated the ravinok's computer, i downloaded the manifest. there were two civilians, in addition to the prisoners and crew. one was your friend, tora naprem, and the other... was tora ziyal... a 13-year-old girl. i suppose you wouldn't... believe me if i told you she was naprem's sister? ziyal is a cardassian name. the way i see it... there's only one explanation. ziyal was naprem's daughter, and you... i was her father. now i know why you're in such a hurry to find the survivors. you're hoping that... ...she's still alive and you can rescue her. not quite. you see, if my daughter is still alive, i'll have no choice but to kill her. i won't let you do it. you are not going to kill that girl. you worry about the other survivors, and let me worry about ziyal. - she is my daughter. - yes, she is. and there is nothing more important to a cardassian than family. my wife and children are my family. they're the ones i must protect. you should have thought of that before. you're right. i should have. but i made a mistake. one i intend to correct. you needn't take her to cardassia. i'll take her to bajor. no one has to know that you're her father. what kind of life would that be for her? your people have never exactly welcomed half-cardassian children. that's why i sent them away. the occupation was coming to an end and there'd be no place for them. - so you sent them to a prison camp. - no! the ravinok was meant to rendezvous with a freighter which would take naprem and ziyal to lissepia, where they could live in some sort of peace. i don't understand. how can you think about killing ziyal now? why not just send her away again? because my position isn't nearly as stable as it was. by aligning myself with the new government, i've made enemies that wouldn't hesitate to use ziyal against me. listen to you! it's not your family you're protecting, it's you. by protecting myself, i am protecting them. and the only one who suffers is ziyal. you would kill your own daughter to save your career. i don't understand you. you said you loved naprem. i saw you crying at her grave. i... did love her. and when i bury ziyal, i'll weep over her grave just as i wept over her mother's. but that will not stop me from doing what i have to do. do you understand? and when the time comes, i suggest you stay out of my way. - good morning, jake-o. - morning, dad. so... what's new? nog and i ran into kasidy last night at the vulcan restaurant. i guess she's not going to take that job after all. did she say why? she said you didn't want her to take it. jake... sometimes things between men and women can get a little... complicated. maybe, but i don't think this is one of those times. - you're scared. - what do i have to be afraid of? a lot. kasidy's willing to change her life just to be close to you. if things don't work out, you'll feel responsible, and that's scary. you figured out all this by yourself? actually, i talked with nog about it. you talked to nog about my relationship with kasidy? we think you have nothing to worry about. if she wants to change jobs, that's her decision, not yours. same thing if she wants to live on the station. if things don't work out, they don't work out. have you told any of this to kasidy? nog and i thought about it but we thought it would be better if you told her yourself. i see. so what's new with you? take a look. breen? what are they doing here? my tricorder's picking up a large concentration of dilithium in the area. they must be using the survivors to mine the ore. it makes perfect sense. the breen homeworld is a frozen wasteland. this place is about 50 degrees too hot for them. - you approve of what they're doing? - no! not at all. i do admire their ingenuity. what is it? it's her. my daughter. we're going to need some help. i'm going to stay here while you go back for reinforcements. i have a better idea. you go back to the station. - i'm sending you back. that's an order. - i hate to refuse it but i must. file an official protest with the cardassian military when we get back. i'm not leaving you here alone. well... then i suggest we devise a plan to rescue these prisoners together. you need me, major. maybe i do. but if you hurt that girl... i promise i'll kill you. - we're here to help. - you're bajoran! gather up the prisoners. tell them to meet us here. - how many guards are there? - eight in the mines. - how many prisoners? - 31. - did lorit akrem make it? - he died. - you knew him? - he was a friend. my condolences, but we don't have time for this. - where can i find tora ziyal? - don't tell him. he's a cardassian! - there's a peace treaty. - the occupation is over? where is the girl? dukat! get the other prisoners. meet me at the entrance to the mine. where is tora ziyal? ziyal. father? it's you! mother said you'd... father, what's wrong? dukat, no! - i'm warning you, dukat. don't do it. - i have no choice. there's always a choice. you don't want to do this. if you did you wouldn't have told me about her. put the rifle down. no. the cardassian prisoners... ...they told me this would happen. that you'd never let me go home. but i didn't, didn't believe them. ziyal, run! i used to dream about you coming to save me. that's what kept me alive. ziyal... if i can't be with you... ...then i'd rather die. let's go home. - kasidy yates. - hello, ben. hold this a second. - about that job with the bajorans. - you know someone who's qualified? i know someone who would be perfect for it. you. i think you should take the job. i want you to take the job. - you've talked to jake. - how do you know? he's a smart boy. must take after his mother. i owe you an apology. you came to tell me wonderful news, and all i could say was, ""it's a big step.” - i don't know what i was thinking. - take a guess. i wanted to tell you how happy i was for you. for us. but it didn't come out that way. i... ...i was uncomfortable and a little nervous. - a little nervous? - all right. a lot nervous. i haven't been in a serious relationship for a long time, and i didn't expect to be in one any time soon... until i met you. this life i lead... ...this job i do... ...that's what got jennifer killed. if anything ever happened to you... why not let me worry about that? - that's what jake said. - you see? smart boy. i could stay here and listen to you apologise all day. - but i've got to get to bajor. - bajor? i thought... i know what you thought. but i took the job. do you think i'd give up a great opportunity just because you got cold feet? you're a good man, benjamin sisko, but you've got a lot to learn about women. especially me. i'll see you when i get back. you can... help me pick out quarters. i'll be here. what was it like, all that time alone with dukat? i've had better weeks. but i'll never forget his face when he sat on that sand spine. i wish i'd been there. - major. - dukat. - where's ziyal? - waiting for me. we'll be leaving for cardassia shortly. i think i'll leave the two of you alone. i just wanted to say... thank you, major, for a most interesting journey. you're taking ziyal to cardassia. after six years, she deserves a home... and a father. won't that make things difficult for you? i'll let you know."
0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"good evening, ladies and gentlemen. and watch your step, please. i'm certain that any of you who have wearily pushed rich maiden aunts in their wheelchairs share my appreciation of elevator shafts. i also find the elevator quite easy to operate. it works just like a yo-yo. well, not exactly, but we do use the same grade of string. we are now about to have our first commercial. and i want to assure you that it will only last 60 seconds. i have to tell everyone this because i understand it gives people the sensation of being trapped between floors. courage. there now, you look absolutely enchanting. haven't you a little compliment for me? do you approve of my new hat? you're a darling, vanessa. never, never mention age. age cannot wither us, nor custom stale our infinite variety. yes, dear, this week has been a little depressing. anniversaries are so dismal, especially one particular anniversary. but i promised not to bring up the past, didn't i? think of it, 15 long years. he'd be 47. why, if he'd lived... now we mustn't get maudlin. we girls have been very fortunate. vanessa, you're really the lucky one, don't deny it. i know exactly what i'll be doing this evening, playing bridge with the dull married couple and their dull daughter. and you, now, don't you look so coy, vanessa. you know what you'll be doing. you'll be going for a walk with your boyfriend. you know, he is good-looking. a little young perhaps, but so well-mannered and polite, almost naive. just the sort of nice young man that an old charm girl like you can wrap around her little paw. ah! there he is now! let me straighten your collar. now, do i look all right? are we ready to welcome him? good evening, eddie. hello, miss fox. well, you needn't stand out there. you want me to come in? well, i think by now you can be permitted to call on vanessa. hello there, vanessa girl! you sure have a pretty apartment. well, i'm glad you like it. vanessa and i had a great deal of fun doing it the way we wanted to. it's very nice. there, you see, vanessa! not every young man would appreciate a room like this. thank you, ma'am. ma'am? heavens, eddie, you make me sound so ancient, like something out of charles dickens. no! no, no, call me miss fox. yes, miss fox. oh, eddie, i'm going out tonight. how will you get in? you could give me a key. oh, no. vanessa and i never permit anyone else to use our key. do we, vanessa? i'll have the super let you in. and from now on, if any reason i'm not here and vanessa needs her walk, you can always have him let you in. yes, miss fox. you'll be here tomorrow night, too? no, ma'am. tomorrow is my day off. miss fox, could i have that $5 now, please? but i gave you your $5 for this week and for the next. i'd like the $5 in advance. well, now, i don't want this getting money in advance to become a habit. are you gambling or something of that sort? oh, no, no! i would just like the $5. vanessa. what are we going to do with this spendthrift? you'd never forgive me if i held out on him, would you? here. thank you, miss fox. oh, vanessa, you naughty girl! all over eddie's uniform. i've just brushed her. all right, eddie, run along with vanessa. tomorrow, young lady, you're going to get your hair clipped and your nails done. you look so pretty when we pay attention to your hair. oh, i know it's a bore, but we girls must keep up our appearances. here. come on. come on. we'll go and see who's calling on mummy. oh, you're such a problem. mummy's ridiculous problem. eddie! can i come in, please? yes. i hardly recognized you. where did you get that dreadful jacket? and vanessa and i never wish to see you unshaven again. i... i've got to have $50. what? i know, but i have to send a money order right away. well, if you're in trouble, i'll understand. i know sometimes... no, ma'am. you don't understand. it's not for me. well, is it for your father, or your mother, or someone in the family? no, not in the family. well, then who is it for? my girl. your girl? yes, you see, she's been in the sanitarium for almost a year. it's her lungs. the state pays half her expenses and i'm supposed to pay the other half. and i've done all right so far, but then, i got this, this morning. another operation. she's only 20. twenty? well, i must say, half her medical expenses is quite a burden for you to assume. yes, but you see, we're going to get married as soon as she gets out of the sanitarium. that's why i thought you'd lend me the money. eddie, you earn a perfectly good salary. $70 a week, that's not my take home pay. well, i think you should have managed better. you've romanticized an attachment to a sick girl, never for a second considering where you'd get the money. how do you think i manage to live the way i do? by planning. i live on a fixed income, and every cent is budgeted. it's only $50. eddie, i couldn't possibly spare you $50. yes, miss fox. excuse me. eddie! eddie, i... good evening, miss fox. good evening, jerry. honestly, vanessa, just because your boyfriend has tonight off and i have to walk with you, is no reason for you to be cross. i'm not going down there, so stop being so stubborn about it. it's dark and dirty down there. no, no, vanessa. very well. you always get your way. now, vanessa, let's turn back. miss fox! miss fox! here you are, miss fox. oh, thank you, sergeant. now, beside the ring, there was the leopard muff containing $180. i don't care anything about the money. i only want the ring back. not only is it valuable, but it's a memento. well, could you describe the man? well, he was a young man of more than average height. i can still feel his sleeve against my skin, rough, cheap material. did he speak? i only remember vanessa barking. how peculiar! vanessa didn't bark until he attacked me. almost as if... as if she knew him. well... sergeant, would you mind? why, certainly not. hello. oh, speaking. good, i'll be right down. miss fox, do you feel well enough to go down to the station? they've picked up a man in a bar about a block from here waving a wad of money, and he can't explain the money. he has a bad record. you know, we could wrap this up tonight. i... may i? thank you. take a good look, miss fox. no, it's not he. are you sure? couldn't possibly be. vanessa, you're utterly irresistible! miss fox, i just came on duty. they told me you wanted to talk to me. yes, eddie. please come in. eddie, you know i was robbed of some money and my ring? yes, miss fox. i wanted to see you to ask your advice. my advice? yes. please, come and sit down. vanessa, run along. there's a dear! oh, please, come and sit down. you see, eddie, i don't care anything about the money. all i want is my ring. i assure you, whoever stole it will have a very difficult time getting rid of it. sure. a ring like that would be hot. exactly. so, you see, whoever took it might just as well return it to me. well, he mightn't figure it that way. if i were to forget the $180 that i lost, and say no more about the matter, wouldn't you agree that i was being extremely lenient with the thief? he still mightn't figure it that way. see, he could break the ring up and sell the diamonds separately. or he could wait until the heat was off and sell it out of town somewhere. is that what you'd do? gosh, i don't know what i'd do. eddie, if it were you who stole the ring, wouldn't you want $500 and no questions asked? how could he be sure that you'd keep your word? then, you don't think my plan will work? no, ma'am. very well, eddie. i merely wanted your advice. you may go. yes, miss fox. sergeant kirby. uh, wait a minute. you eddie mcmahon? yeah, that's right. you walk miss fox's dog. correct? sure. yesterday was your day off? what of it? well, you were seen leaving this apartment. miss fox can tell you about that. eddie, do you really want me to tell? what's there to tell? eddie asked me to loan him $50. i refused. what did you want $50 for? oh, something about a sweetheart. he was really quite desperate. miss fox... all right. wait a minute! was it mcmahon? well, i hoped it wouldn't come to this. i gave you your chance a little while ago. i offered you a great deal of money and you refused. i can still feel your jacket as you choked me. how could you do that to me? to me? i didn't take your ring! can you positively identify him? that's a lie! you know that's a lie! i'm sorry, eddie. believe me. but i gave you your chance. sergeant, would you please excuse me. i don't feel very well. when your man returned from the walk with my poor little dog, he definitely had liquor on his breath! what sort of an employment agency do you run? when will he be here? well, let's hope so. thank you. oh, vanessa, darling, i'll have to walk with you myself, unless we can find the proper person. let's hope this next one will be... will be someone we can have a rapport with. someone that... ah, here he is now. sergeant kirby. how very amusing. i thought you were an applicant to walk vanessa. well, i haven't seen you, good heavens, since the trial. the day eddie was convicted, almost a year ago. has he confessed what he did with my ring? about your ring. eddie mcmahon never had it. never had it? do you remember the man you didn't identify? we picked him up on another charge. we found your ring in his room. he confessed. he... but i saw eddie, i saw him! did you? well, i thought i did. i was so positive. an innocent man has been in jail for almost a year. well, if i made a mistake, it was an honest one. after all, you're the detective. it was up to you to check these things. he had no alibi at the trial, whatsoever. a jury found him guilty. on your positive identification. i'll feel a lot better when eddie is released. goodbye, miss fox. oh, sergeant! you forgot my ring. we have to keep it for evidence until eddie is released. well, i hope it won't take weeks and weeks. i'm sure eddie feels the same way. sergeant? when will eddie be released? most likely tomorrow. why, eddie. how nice to see you. morning, miss fox. hello there, vanessa. i'm so pleased you got your job back. i spoke to the manager about it, you know. eddie, you seem different. people change a lot in a year. eddie, i want you to know it wasn't easy for me to testify against you. i... well, i only told the court what i thought was the truth. this is your floor, miss fox. will you walk vanessa tonight? no, ma'am. i'm afraid not. if you only knew how she's missed you. yes, ma'am. eddie, wait a minute, will you? yes, miss fox. knowing you were coming back, i've been holding this for you until we met. you remember, i was prepared to pay $500 for my ring. i... well, i had set it aside, and i can't think of a better use for it than to give it to you, as, well, shall we say a birthday present or a re-birthday present? come, vanessa. oh, how is your fiancée? she died while i was in prison. miss fox. good evening, jerry. now, let's not linger, vanessa. let's take our little walk and get back as quickly as possible. we'll walk to the corner and call it a night, shall we?

1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"(""alfred hitchcock"" theme music) - good evening. contrary to appearances, we are not converting our show into a middle eastern, western. this is a lovely gift that just arrived and i'm having workmen tear out a wall so that i can get it into the house. what is especially touching is that the gift came from a person i had not regarded as a friend, a social climber who is always trying to wrangle an invitation to my home. i'm quite pleased, however. now that i have a wooden horse, i may even take up water polo. from this innocent hobby horse, we turn to a hobby of another kind. tonight's program is dedicated to the do-it-yourselfer and is called, ""how to get rid of your wife"". it concerns one gerald swinney, a gentleman seemingly too meek for the task ahead, but we shall see, we shall see. as a special feature tonight, we are delaying the start of the story by one minute, time for you to gather up a pencil and paper. after all, some of you may wish to take notes. (playful jazzy music) (slow jazzy music) - oh i uh, i wonder if i might have a word with miss feather if that's possible, miss uh, rosie feather. - you're gerald swinney, aren't you? - yes. - i've been reading the paper about you, i mean about the case. the verdict? well, that's life. i'll tell her you're here. (quiet jazzy music) mr. swinney, come this way. (knocking on the door) - come in. - mr. swinney, rosie. - oh hello mr. swinney. what are you doing here? - well i hope this isn't inconvenient. i uh, i just wanted to apologize. - [rosie] what for? - oh uh, would you accept these? - oh, carnations, why they're lovely. won't you sit down? - i uh, just wondered if there was anything i could do. - do? - well it must have been unpleasant and embarrassing. - oh mr. swinney, i never had so much publicity in my whole life. it was fantastic. - oh? - oh, i mean uh, of course i realize that it was at somebody else's expense, if you know what i mean. - you really shouldn't feel that way. - oh but i do. i mean, every single minute in that awful court, i kept thinking to myself, this should have never happened, not to somebody like you. i mean we all thought the same way, everybody. you have nothing to apologize for, mr. swinney. look, it's all over now, isn't it? - yes. - uh, i guess i better put these in water. oh, would you like a drink? - oh i really don't think i should. - after what you've been through? go on, it'll do you good. - well all right. thank you very much, miss feather. - rosie. uh well, everything's over there, help yourself. i'm gonna go behind here and change. mr. swinney, i'm glad you came by. we all understand how you feel and we're very sorry. - thank you. - [swinney voiceover] people are sympathetic. if they weren't things wouldn't have turned out the way they did. poor edith, how did it all really begin? the day i married her, i suppose. i used to think things would get better in the 15 years we lived together, but they didn't. - gerald? gerald. gerald, where are you? why don't you answer me? gerald. you don't smoke in this room, gerald. - are you happy, edith? - what are you talking about? - i wanna know. - you do. without my mother, you and i would have absolutely nothing. you've been a clerk for 15 years. happy, huh, i'd a been a lot better off without you. - i walked right into it, didn't i? - what's that supposed to mean? - this nice refined home, dear old smiling mother and you all fluttery and correct, two kind, helpless women and one unsuspecting bachelor. on went the rings and off came the mask. i had no idea what it was all about. - are you through? - no. i want a divorce, edith. - oh, so that's what all this nonsense has been about. well let me tell you, there'll be no divorce in this house and if you're thinking of walking out on me, don't. i know what's what and i know my rights and you haven't got a chance! and just you remember it! gerald, i've had just about enough of this. are you coming downstairs or aren't you? (boxes clattering) - edith, where's my fishing equipment? - it was cluttering up the closet. - where's my fly box with the brown hackles? - i gave it to the club for the bazaar. - without telling me. - oh gerald, you haven't been fishing in years. - do you realize i spent hours tying those flies? - that's right, a useless waste of time, so i got rid of it. - well edith, i'm just going to have to get rid of you. (dramatic slow music) - [swinney voiceover] i gave the matter a lot of thought and worked out a plan of campaign. on the next saturday night, i put the first stage into operation. i stayed at al's bar until closing time. the neighbors were about to see edith in action. - oh, mr. swinney. i'll walk along with you. - oh good, good. (gentle jazzy music) (door rattling) uh, edith? uh, edith dear? edith? - [mr. penny] what's wrong? locked out? - yeah, it's all right. - he's locked out. - oh. - mr. swinney, why don't you come in and sit down? - oh that's very kind of you, but i really don't think i should. mrs. swinney hasn't been too well since her dear mother passed on. well, i'll be all right. i'll take a walk or something. - mr. swinney, you're a saint. - goodnight. - goodnight. - [mrs. harris] oh, good morning mrs. penny. - good morning, mrs. harris. did you hear? - [mrs. harris] hear what? - she locked him out last night. - no. - yes. - (gasps) the poor man. - if she goes on the way she is, one of these days he's gonna do something to himself. he's just the type. - oh, poor mr. swinney. - gerald are you bringing my coffee? gerald? what's all this about? - it's called reorganization, edith. i've always liked a good breakfast, so instead of you cooking and me washing the dishes, i've decided to change that around. i'll cook and you wash. - where's my coffee? - it's right there on the tray. i decided to have my breakfast first. (chair squeaks) yes, it's empty. we need more. (playful music) - gerald! gerald, come here! (playful slow music) - [gerald] yes dear. - don't you dear me, i know what you're trying to do, you're trying to frighten me out of this house, my house. let me tell you, you won't succeed. - you're imagining things, edith. - oh edith, you're imagining things, you must be. - will you listen to me, every time i turn around, he seems to have a knife in his hand and yesterday, yesterday he came home with a half gallon of stain remover. - what? - [edith] you see? - well obviously he needs it for something. - of course he does, that's what i mean. - oh edith, gerald's not the type. he's much too gentle. - oh no he's not, not underneath. oh laura, you've got to help me, you and henry. - but how? - [edith] come over saturday for lunch. - edith, i don't think-- - he's worse on weekends. - all right edith, all right. - (sighs) laura, i've got to prove to you, gerald is a monster. (playful slow music) what are you digging, gerald? - oh it's uh, it's a surprise, dear. - this is my house and my garden, i demand to know why you're digging it up. - it's uh, it's going to be a fish pond. - [edith] a what? - a pond for uh, fish. - i'm not as big a fool as you think i am, gerald swinney. i know what you're up to and as of now, you can start filling it up. now, now! - hi there, mr. swinney. - oh, morning mr. penny. - ah it's a pity, fish pond woulda looked nice there. - gerald? i've changed my mind, we'll have the fish pond. - anything you say, dear. - well go on, dig. dig! and i'll thank you to mind your own business, mr. penny. - oh i don't know how you stand it, i really don't. - well she's just a bit upset, nothing to worry about really. - i think my wife is right, you must be some kind of saint. (gentle playful music) (gentle music) - come in, come in, hello dear. - [laura] hello edith. - hello edith. - henry dear, how are you? - all right, i guess. - well, you couldn't have arrived at a more perfect time. you won't be disappointed. - what do you mean? - i didn't tell him you were coming and do you know where he is at this very moment? he's out in the garden digging. - digging? - digging a grave. - who for? - oh henry. - i must say, edith, you've kept the house looking awfully nice. - well i certainly don't know how. i don't know what i'm doing half the time. i'm afraid to even eat or drink anything if he's been anywhere near it. - oh edith. - well it's the truth, tins of weed killer, knives, stain remover and this morning, i found a book beside his bed, a chemistry book with a bookmark in the chapter on acids. - gerald's always reading funny books, i mean peculiar. - henry, he's told me he's going to get rid of me. - edith, edith, henry and i have talked about this and we think you ought to see a doctor. - laura, there's nothing wrong with me, it's gerald. he's acting peculiar. - hi gerald. - well henry, there's a surprise. i didn't know you were coming over. - how are ya? - oh fine, fine, i've been keeping busy. - yes, i see. what is it? - oh i'm putting in a fish pond. - oh that's a good idea. uh, how has edith been? - so so. not good really. - just between you and me, laura and i have been a little worried about her. - i thought the best thing i could do is sorta cheer up the place, you know, do a little decorating, but last week, i brought home a can of stain remover and she just came apart. then i decided on the fish pond, but, well, that hasn't set too well either. - you know don't you, her mother left everything to her and we got nothing. - yeah, she told me. - then this doesn't seem to have done her much good. - edith isn't well. we're all going to have to try and be very patient with her. (doorbell rings) excuse me. - uh, mr. swinney? - yes, um, i wonder if you'd mind bringing that around back for me? - yeah. uh, through this way? - [gerald] yeah, right through there. - [deliveryman] okay. - uh s'cuse me, all. you make it through here? - it's one of those tanks. now do you believe me? - edith, it's for the fish pond. - oh no it's not, it's for the acid. - oh don't be silly. - oh really edith-- - you can't put acid into one of those things unless it's glass. - how do you know what those things are made of? - edith, you really must control yourself. even if gerald were planning something, would you think he'd be so obvious about it? - he didn't know you were coming. don't you see? - yes. there's only one thing to do, tell gerald to call the doctor. - no. - yes, edith. - i am perfectly all right. it's just that i'm so frightened and that's just what gerald wants. he wants me to be frightened. - henry-- - [edith] where are you going? - i want to talk to henry for a moment. (doors clatter) if anyone ought to be frightened, it's gerald. - what do you mean? - the state she's in, she might do anything. henry, i don't think we should get mixed up in this. - then let's go. - what are you whispering about? - excuse me please. - [laura] gerald, we're going to have to go now. - oh you're going so soon? - 'fraid so. - [gerald] oh, uh, there you are. - oh, thanks a lot. - goodbye edith dear. take care of yourself. - edith, try not to worry too much. - goodbye gerald dear. drop in and see us, won't you? - bye gerald. - bye henry. bye laura, nice seeing you! (door clatters) - what were they whispering about? - i don't know. - i am not stupid, gerald. - yes dear. - i know what you're doing, you're deliberately trying to frighten me and you're deliberately trying to turn everyone against me. - if i were, edith, it'd be very easy because you're so predictable. - oh i am, am i? well i'm not gonna stand for anymore of it! - i've been waiting for you to say that. - get out of this house! stay out! - all right. (playful jazzy music) - gerald! i told you to get out! - [gerald] yes dear, but what about all this? - don't bother about all that! you get out and you stay out! - if that's the way you want it, dear. (playful jazzy music) (door clattering) - gerald? gerald, i don't know what you're up to now, but i told you to get out and i meant it! - don't worry, edith, i'm going. - if you think i'm going to hang around, i'm not. i'm going to bed, but before i do, i want it clearly understood that you are still responsible for the upkeep of this house! do you understand? and don't come back until you're ready to apologize, on your knees! (playful jazzy music) - [gerald voiceover] people are very sympathetic. i timed my departure for 10:00 on sunday morning. i knew this would give them every opportunity to express their feelings. or edith, i knew she was watching. and she had another shot coming to her when she went into my bedroom 'cause i knew she would. (playful jazzy music) - somebody out here to see you, rosie. - oh? - it's a woman. - oh. - she says it's important. - [rosie] well what does she want? - well how do i know? - miss feather? - that's right. - i am gerald's wife. - oh. who's gerald? - well i didn't expect you to admit anything. - look, i gotta change. - yes, you do. now i don't know how long this thing has been going on, but it's got to stop. - stop is right, because one of us is making a fool out of herself and it's not me! - miss feather, is this or is this not your photograph? - where'd you get this? - in gerald's bed. - but-- - i let gerald leave home because i thought it would bring him to his sense. of course i had no idea there was another woman involved. - you mean me? - gerald knows i'll never give him a divorce. - well, i'm very sorry, dear, but you've made a mistake. now i've gotta change. - [edith] i'd advise you to listen to what i've got to say. - bye dear. - [edith] mrs. swinney to you. - i said goodbye! - [edith] and i have no intention of leaving. - oscar! - [edith] gerald is coming back home. - look, i told you, i don't know any gerald. - ha! (door slams) - now just a minute! - if he refuses, i'll go straight to the bank. - somebody help me! - one word to the manager and gerald will be out of a job. - oscar! - you might be interested to know that gerald doesn't have a cent to his name. - what is it, rosie? - do something, anything, get her out of here! - i don't mind saying what i have to say in front of a witness. this creature has been carrying on with my husband. - what? - i don't know her husband. - come on, lady. - not 'til she promises never to see gerald again. - all right, all right, anything. - there, you see? she's admitted it. - i'm gonna be hysterical in a minute. - you'd better leave now. - take your hands off of me. this woman has given me her word in front of a witness, that she shall no longer associate or continue to associate with my husband and if she does, she knows what the circumstances will be. that's all i came to say. goodnight. - once and for all, i wouldn't know your husband if i fell over him! (door slams) (dramatic music) - [gerald voiceover] edith then came to the bank and threatened to expose me unless i returned home immediately. it was all working out very well, but the next stage in the precedings was going to need rather careful handling. (bell rings) (playful music) - hello! (playful music) (gerald whistling) - [clerk] good morning, can i help you? - oh uh, yes, i'm interesting in acquiring a couple rats. - rats sir, yes, well i've got a good selection at the moment. were you thinking of the emperor whites or the ordinary grays? - the ordinary grays, i think. - i see, well they're right over here. if you'd like to come this way? (bird squawking) you haven't been in before, have you? no, i didn't think so. well here we are, as nice a selection as you can see. - [gerald] mmhmm. i think i'll have that one. - the big fat one, sir? (rat squeaking) - and and that one. - he's my favorite. i call him romeo. well nevermind, i can tell he'll be going to a good home. just the two? - [gerald] uh yes. - yeah, i see, well why don't you look around. you're fond of animals, i can always tell. it won't be but a minute. (bird squawking) (birds chirping) - polly, polly, polly. polly, polly, polly. - here we are, mr. uh-- - uh, jones. - mr. jones. that'll be $3.20. now that you've been in and seen my little place, maybe you'll be coming in again. - there we are. - thank you very much. - goodbye mr. jones. - uh, goodbye. (playful music) (door clicks) (dish clinking) (playful music) - gerald, (sniffing) i smell perfume. - perfume? - and it's on you. - oh it's a new brand of aftershave lotion. - you don't expect me to believe that. i know you've been with that woman. gerald, we're going to have a little talk. - all right, dear. - it seems as though one or two misguided people think that you are going to do away with yourself. - they have? - mrs. harris told me in the beauty parlor. i know what you're up to. you're only trying to get their sympathy and nothing more. - really edith? - well i haven't been able to get the evidence as yet, but believe me, i will and when i do, you can be sure that i will expose you and all your little games. and you needn't look so innocent, gerald. i know you've been seeing her, that, that dreadful creature. aftershave lotion, ha! (edith screams) - what is it, edith? - rats. rats! (screams) (gentle jazzy music) - [gerald voiceover] where anything as distasteful as rats was concerned, edith would, i know, choose the most private and discrete way of dealing with them. she would not, therefore, seek the aid of any professional exterminator. of this, i felt certain. what was the alternative? trap? no. and for reasons which you will more than understand, i was also quite certain she would not ask me to do the necessary shopping. (cheerful jazzy music) all i had to do was choose my moment and find the hiding place. and there it was. now everything was set. (cheerful jazzy music) - gerald! (cheerful jazzy music) going someplace? - yes. - indeed. - my own freewill. - and just where do you think you're going? to rosie feather? - can't prove anything, edith. even if you could, it wouldn't matter. - so, you admit it. - i've written you a letter, edith. i suppose you could call it a confession, perhaps a statement. to whom it may concern, i can see no point in my wife and i going on together. i am wrong in what i am doing. the responsibility is entirely mine. time is the great healer and i've signed. - how do you suppose this is going to help you? - doesn't matter, edith. you see, i don't care what you do. i'm leaving you first thing in the morning. - is that all you've got to say? - yes. - oh it is, is it? well let me tell you, you're not going anywhere! to rosie feather or anybody else! - i am, edith. as you said, everyone on the block knows i'm desperate. they're expecting me to do something. (dramatic music) (gentle dramatic music) - so, do you intend to leave first thing in the morning? - [gerald] it's the only way, edith. - is it? - we were never really suited, were we? - perhaps not. - [gerald] well i'm glad you're not making a scene. - you don't really know me, gerald. - shall i make the chocolate tonight? - no, i'll do it. i'll make the hot chocolate tonight. (dramatic music) (playful jazzy music) gerald, i've left your chocolate on the stove. you may help yourself. do you hear me? - uh yes, yes, i heard you dear. thank you. (playful jazzy music) (dramatic music) (milk bottles rattling) (gentle soft music) - (whispers) gerald? (gentle soft music) (phone rings) - hello? - it's gerald, it's happened. - what, what do you mean? - he's dead. - what? - he's, he poisoned himself. - good grief, poisoned himself? - yes, i found a note beside his body and a can of poison in the kitchen. - edith, are you sure? - of course i'm sure. (slow jazzy music) - um, body's upstairs? - [edith] yes, the door on the left. (slow jazzy music) (dramatic music) - mmhmm. but, what is this? - is something wrong? - you're supposed to be dead. - (laughs) what? - are you gerald swinney? - yes. - then you wrote this note? - yes. - well? - i'm sorry, i'm a bit confused. i don't know what to say. i was going to leave my wife. we discussed it all last night, quite rationally. i planned to leave this morning. i wrote the note because i wanted to make my intentions clear. didn't want it to appear that she was in the wrong. - what about the poison? - poison? - in the hot chocolate. - oh, my wife did leave some chocolate for me on the stove last night. i didn't feel like, i don't know why, i put it in that. i didn't want her to think i hadn't drunk it. she's a bit uh, uh, sensitive. - well, by the looks of things, i'd say you had a very lucky escape. - gerald! (playful music) - good morning, dear. (cheerful music) - [gerald voiceover] i was very impressed by the way in which the law took its course. all the pieces of the jigsaw fell into place. the overall picture of edith being, from my point of view, brilliantly highlighted by the truly splendid work of the district attorney. - now miss feather, one of your many admirers, it seems, was unfortunately careless enough to leave this photograph of you in a library book and it was by this accident that it came into gerald swinney's possession. in other words-- - by chance, by sheer chance. - therefore, i'm right in saying that there was never any kind of contact between you and gerald swinney. - absolutely none whatsoever, definitely. - edith seemed convinced that gerald was, was planning to do away with her. - [district attorney] how? - she mentioned knives, a book on acid, weed killer poison. - poison? - yes. - so it could be said that although, at this time, she imagined herself to be the prospective victim, she was obsessed by thoughts of death, of death by poisoning. the seed was there. thank you. when the accused telephoned you that gerald swinney had poisoned himself, what was your reaction? your answer is important. - we thought that gerald must have done it in desperation. - [district attorney] desperation? - edith can be very determined. - you mean in preventing her husband from leaving her? - yes. - so that later, when the truth became evident, you were no doubt shocked, but were you surprised? - i-- - yes or no? - no. - thank you. no further questions. mrs. harris, will you tell the court now what happened at the hair dresser's? - well, i thought it was my duty to make quite sure that edith swinney should hear me. - [district attorney] hear what? - well, that she was driving her husband to suicide. - [district attorney] you tried to warn her? - well yes. - [district attorney] with what results? - she hit the roof. - i suggest that there can be no doubt that this was the incident which put into edith swinney's mind the idea of being able to get away with murdering her husband by making it appear that he had taken his own life. thank you, mrs. harris. - yes sir, i recall real clearly, lady came into the drugstore and asked for some rat poison. - is that all? - she said she didn't want something that wasn't real effective. we stock three different brands. she wanted something real powerful. well i sold it to her. - [district attorney] mrs. penny, have you ever been troubled with rats? - rats? - [district attorney] rats. - oh no, why, oh no. - [district attorney] do you know anyone in your vicinity who has? - well of course i'd know, but i don't. - in other words, no. would you say that edith swinney's house was badly kept? - oh, it was like a hospital. - clinically clean. thank you, mrs. penny. - said uh, uh, ""you devil, you devil."" - [district attorney] is there anything about these words that particularly impressed you? - yes sir, their vehemence. - thank you. your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the defense council has insisted that you accept the fact that edith swinney is the victim of a diabolical plot, designed by her husband to lead her to the very brink of murder. for what reason? to incriminate her and to provide himself with irrefutable grounds for divorce at the conclusion of this trial. but the true pattern of events, as you followed them, must surely prove the case against edith swinney. she intended to poison her husband, there's no doubt about that. by the grace of god, she did not succeed. but she intended to succeed and it was premeditated. need i say more? ladies and gentlemen of the jury, i put it to you that edith swinney is guilty of attempted murder and that there are no extenuating circumstances. - it's not true! - [man] guilty. - it's not true! - [man] guilty. (dramatic music) (cheerful jazzy music) - are you all right, mr. swinney? - oh, i'm fine. - now that it's all over, what are you gonna do? - do? - uh, mr. swinney? - uh, gerald. - gerald, you've had a narrow escape, but well life's given you another chance. - yes. - and you should take it. you should free yourself. - you mean divorce? - when something's over, it's over. nothing'll ever make it right. - those are words of wisdom, rosie. (knocking at the door) - oh, i guess i'd better get ready to go on. - oh i'm in the way. - oh no you're not. i've only got one more show to do. i'll be through by 10:00. - i don't supposed you'd care for something to eat? - well uh, yes, i would. - well i'll stop back for you then. - all right. - just after 10:00. - i'll be ready. - well, uh, bye for now. - bye for now. (playful slow music) (cheerful upbeat music) - hello mr. jones. i felt somehow you might remember me. i remember you very well. that goes without saying. i'm so glad everything went so well. - what do you mean? - oh i followed the whole case and i recognized your picture. it was a good one of you. as a matter of fact, i've kept it. i've had it framed. funny word, framed. - yes, well if you'll excuse me-- - oh no, no, i thought we might have a little something to eat together. - well i'm afraid i have another appointment. - you know, i keep wondering why you didn't tell anyone, there might have been rats in your wife's house. - are you suggesting-- - you didn't even mention buying them. - no. - you know when you came in my shop that day, i knew you were as lonely a person as i was and well, i had a sort of feeling we might meet again and that everything would be better for both of us. funny, wasn't it? - would you care for a sandwich or something more substantial? - something more substantial, thank you. (playful slow music) - i still have my wife, but you will notice i have gotten rid of my horse. i wouldn't have cared if it were a talking horse, but i discovered this one was ticking. i promptly gave it away. i felt there were others who deserved it more than i, my sponsor for one. after all, the very foundation of commercial television is the trojan horse principle as witness the following.

1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"oh good evening, i just had a terrible nightmare, it lasted only a minute but it was a shattering experience, let me tell you about it before we see tonight's play, it was like a motion picture and as i watched, a voice kept shouting at me... you can't trust a man i asked for drums in the last number not a native uprising. musicians. must have merged with the steel workers union. oh i thought you sounded lovely miss coe. -'lovely miss coe', you always think i sound lovely don't you pauline? but you do. of course i do and you like to collect your salary. oh, miss coe... um im just tired pauline you must be tired too. why don't you go on home i can manage. -oh that's what you want. -that's what i want. -good night. -good night pauline. -i knew you'd come tony. -i couldn't refuse it, a personal invitation from the great crystal coe, right? delivered after i received your threatening note. threatening? you must be imagining things, that was just a fan letter. you always did have a big imagination, remember the story you told me back in cleveland? ""i can't take the rap tony, i don't want our baby born in prison"". i never did get a birth announcement. a girl can make a mistake. she sure can. no birth announcements, no letters, seven years is a long time to sit and stir, without letters. i didn't know you could sing baby. -all right tony what do you want? -seven years, seven empty years, at first i nearly went crazy wondering why you didn't write. i even thought that stupid jim miller operator, might have realized it was your, fingers in his till instead of mine. then one day, the days, weren't empty anymore, because i saw your picture in a newspaper, i didn't recognize you right off, now with the dark hair, the fancy clothes, and that name, crystal coe. the paper said you just changed your name by marrying a band leader, what happened to him baby? was he the one who shot himself or, was he the one who turned alcoholic? no, no, i remember now that was your uh, second husband. i read all about it in one of those fan magazines, ""the tragic loves of crystal coe"", but the story went on to say that you had found happiness, at last, with an older man old, enough to own a few oil fields. all right so we've had the story of my life. not quite, i could do a sequel, crystal coe's secret love, how do you like that for a title? -it'll never sell. -why not? because i can't swim in oil? -because you can't prove anything. -you know better than that baby, no matter how many pieces of paper you destroy, there's always a piece left somewhere. nice, this must have cost mr oil wells and needs some, oh everything is so expensive these days. how expensive tony? very nice. sometimes when i was sweating out that stretch for you, id wake up in the night, if i get where i was, id reach out in the darkness and grab an arm full of air, we did have some good times together baby, didn't we? you must remember that. i stopped remembering a long time ago. but i couldn't forget, that's the crazy thing, whatever you did i made excuses, even when you stole the money, i blamed myself, because i couldn't give you all the things you wanted. remember how i used to tinker around in the basement, trying to invent something it would make us rich? yes no invention can improve on nature. a girl has to live, she can't wait around forever she has to live. are you sure of that crystal? i could have saved the suckers you married a lot of cash, if i had sounded off. me the jailbird crystal coe couldn't acknowledge, even to a judge, but that would have spoiled everything. for both of us tony. yeah, and now you're getting the idea, that's what i had in mind all these years, so tony kept his mouth shut went on tinkering, and remembering, i have places for that even in prison you know, how much do you want tony? you're not the only one that likes expensive things, seven years of hunger can give a man a real appetite, for expensive things. i ask you how much. for what i want, you won't need your checkbook. after all, you never divorced me, im still your husband. -i like the old days. -you don't have to remind me. i bet i don't. real class, i suppose when the, ashtrays are filled you trade for a new model. not immediately, i had the chauffeur empty them the first six months. hey that's an oldie, remember that one? the old tunes are the best, the old tunes, the old loves. where we going? you called it tony. what about mr oil? mr wyncliff is in san francisco on business. and the chauffeur? there's no one at the beach house this time of year, no one at all. that should be cozy. it's a long drive id better get some gas. ¿where you are going? now it's my business. -this is where we fight. -i don't understand. i bet you don't. nobody ever walked out on you did they baby. nobody ever turned down such an invitation, that's what i had in mind when i gave you that spiel about those 700 years, i wanted you to learn what it feels like to have the, only thing you can offer thrown back at your face, don't you get it? im the stupid fool that sweated out seven years in a cell because i loved you. you were in my blood, even when i knew about all the other men, i ripped your pictures apart a thousand times ive, smashed your face until it wouldn't look good any man, for seven years, i dreamed of what id do when i got out and found you again. -tony... -and last night i did find you, i went to that club, saw the woman not going through so much for, -a fancy saloon tramp. -is that why you wrote the letter to me? -just to tell me that. -i didn't intend to tell you anything. i wrote the letter so you'd know i was out, so you could do a little sweating for a change, i never intended to see you again, ive had it baby , im cured i don't want you, anymore in the beach house or anywhere else. wait, don't get out of here. oh i get it, -you're known here. -yes i'am. and you wouldn't want a shabby bum like me getting out of your car, under all these lights. anymore you wanted me to be seen at the club, the dressing room, after the last show, those were the directions. you're very understanding. nice try baby, but you're not getting through. thank you. go on tony take it. my gun, you've kept it. no thanks baby i don't want this gift either. would you please sign this now? it's a terrible pen you've got there can you read the signature? i sure can madame. is the boulevard open all the way out to the beach? they were working on it yesterday. boulevard? um yes it's okay now. fine ill stay on the boulevard. it's good to be able to find a service station open at this hour. i usually have a chauffeur fill the tank every morning but this morning i forgot. it's easy to get careless isn't to? how did you set up this cozy rendezvous? you said i was going to kill you? as you said tony there's always a record left somewhere. -a record? -proof of our marriage. fortunately you're the only person on this earth who'd ever think to look for it. look, i told you i didn't want any part of you, and i wouldn't dream sporting your setup with wyncliff, any man that marries you deserves all the grief he gets, even if it isn't illegal. let me out at that bus stop. -you can't get a bus this time of night. -then ill walk. you don't have to walk tony ill take you where you're going. what is this? is your pride wounded or something? do you still think you can stir up the embers at that beach house? -maybe that's it. -and maybe it is. what's that? the police. you should kill me back at the station tony but i knew you wouldn't, you never have that kind of nerve. -i don't want your money. -you get what you want, and keep it. i don't want your money. tony the first lesson i ever learned was that you can't trust a man. what happened here lady? he tried to kill me. this man kill me, call police. did you write this statement to the station lieutenant miss coe? -yes. -may i? i, it was the only thing i could think to do i was so frightened. -well did you know this man? -no id id never seen him before. -he was waiting in the car when i i left the club after the last show. -mmm. with this gun? yes. i thought he wanted money i, i offered him my purse but he wouldn't get up. i saw the service station up ahead, and i knew there was a police car behind me, and then he heard the siren and, and he made me drive faster, and i stopped the car suddenly and then he dropped the gun, we struck for it... lieutenant you heard my wife's story, and you have the statement of the station, attendant also the officer in the police car, now it's been a very rough night and id like to take my wife home as soon as possible, well i don't see any reason why you shouldn't, bump crawl in the car in the parking lot got himself shot struggling for the gun, that's about the size of it. well thank you very much for your help mmiss coe, i won't need to detain you any further. of course you'll have to appear before the judge, it's just a formality and then you'll be free to go. it was a joke getting off the plane and news like that last night. -was a joke to me too. -i can see that. i blame myself, i could have cut the conference short taken an earlier plane. -it wouldn't have made any difference. -but it would. have id have been at the club to pick you up as usual, well you shouldn't be driving alone at that late hour, crystal, this nonsense has to stop, when you finish at the club next week im going to take you away, ill take you anywhere you want to go, -the bahamas, mexico, south america. -oh george that would be wonderful. then it's all settled. oh when i think of last night what could have happened to you. now who could that be? well if it's those reporters again ill get rid of them. -im sorry... -lieutenant? -oh come in. -thank you. i uh brought your wife's car back i thought you might be needing it. oh well we were just having some coffee, won't you join us? -no thank you. -oh good morning miss coe, -ive been drinking coffee all night. -the lieutenant brought your car back darling. -your keys miss coe. -thank you lieutenant. or rather i should say uh mrs wyncliff? i thought you might be interested to hear, what we learned about our friend of last night. -hello, sit down lieutenant. -thank you. you're a lucky woman mrs wincliff, that was a dangerous man, an ex-convict, there's no doubt my mind but the current, jury will find this to be a clear case of self-defense, this mess is going to cause somebody a headache, and im glad it's not my department. -headache? -a big headache, you see mrs wincliff, downtown headquarters had a full report on this man, he was paroled in another state with permission to come out here to, close a business deal, he had invented something while he was in prison, some kind of electronic equipment and, few hours before his death he had signed a contract that, well, should let him quite a sum in royalties, it's going to entail a lot of work to dig up this man's past, and to find his beneficiary. i just learned that nightmare i had was a commercial, i suppose one can't expect to get pleasant dreams for nothing, but i never realized before that they were sponsored, now that you know there is no escaping sleep, perhaps you'll watch the following electronic nightmare, please do not be frightened i should be right here all the time. all for tonight now you're on your own, so until next week at the same time, pleasant dreams."

i have every issue. check out the models. this is where you came from. you used to stand right here. i'll tell you a story. one that i'm sure you've never heard. in the valley where i grew... there lived a pack of demons... who would emerge on every black moon to feed. when i was no older than you... out tending our fields, these demons... they caught my whole family. what'd you do? i fled. i hid in the hills. you're kidding. seriously? to this day... no matter how many battles that i win... i'm still haunted by the one battle i never fought. azoth? azoth? just woke up. i had a dream you went back to your realm. you took me with you. i could use a squire. how hard is it to keep this damn fridge stocked?

in the galactica bookstore. he plays azoth at comic conventions. honey, your father's right. you shouldn't be hanging around... with a grown man you hardly know. but, mom, he's... forget it, craig! no more azoth. no more fantasy crap. - mom... - end of discussion! see?

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"good evening. have you ever had a premonition? a feeling that something dreadful was about to happen? i mentioned that, obviously, because tonight's play is about a young man... named kim stanger. about his strange homecoming... and of the mystery he found when he arrived. follow him if you will, as he attempts to unravel this mystery... hindered at every step by his friends... and haunted always by a vague sense of foreboding. this story is appropriately entitled premonition. i defy you to guess the nature of kim stanger's premonition... although we shall give you numerous clues in the prologue... which we now present immediately. at first, i didn't know... what it was that brought me home. a sudden impulse, a hunch. a restless feeling that wouldn't leave me... until i gave in and got on the plane. i'd been so far away for so long. it seemed incredible that in such a very few hours... i was home again. welcome home, mr. stanger. have a pleasant visit, sir. good day. bryant's drug store. charlie the barber. the wilson real estate office. everything exactly as it was when i had left over four years ago. nothing ever changes in stangerford. kim? doug? doug irwin. when did you get home? just arrived from paris. paris? how are you? fine. working hard. working? yes. my music. advanced composition at the sorbonne. been doing a little conducting on the side. been there two years, and two in rome before that. what brought you home? i don't know. i suddenly felt homesick... and i grabbed a plane. does a man have to have a reason for coming home? family know you're here? no, i thought i'd surprise them. i'm on my way to the office. wanna come along? we'll phone them from there. where's your baggage? so you just felt like coming home? yes. and i wanted to see my father. does he still hate me, doug? never quite fit the pattern, did i? greg never understood that. kim, your father never hated you. then why doesn't he answer my letters? i don't know exactly what to say. i got to be getting home, see the family. i'll probably see you tonight. kim, you won't find anybody home. they're all out this afternoon. where? perry is playing in a tennis tournament. how is my brother? oh, he's great. well, kim, i... i don't think this is a good idea. what? coming home like this without warning. why? well, the family will be disappointed... if you don't give them a chance to stage a little welcome. why not come up to the office, clean up a bit? we'll phone them you're coming. doug, what's wrong? nothing, kim. you sure? yes, kim, i'm sure. come on. doug, i said i'm going home. see you tomorrow. all right. something was wrong. i could feel it. i'd felt it before, miles away in paris. a premonition. a sense of dread that came from nowhere... like thunder on a clear day. i knew now that it was this that brought me home. hello. anybody home? there he was... still holding court from his throne over the fireplace. looking at him, i could see white sails and blue water. hear the crack of the canvas as he slammed the wheel over... and we came around on a tack. the rest came back, too. the tennis games. the singing of the reel under 750 pounds of nova scotia bluefin. the skiing and polo... and deer hunts in maine. but something was wrong. susan. kim. how are you, su? all right. i wasn't here for the festivities. mind if i kiss my sister-in-law? oh, kim. why did you come back like this without telling us? your father just asked me the same question. is it a crime to come home to your family? greg hasn't written me in four years. i thought if he knew i was coming, he might walk out. is that why you came back? why didn't he answer my letters? why does he make me choose between him and my music? won't he ever understand that music is born into a man... like a heartbeat and you can't rip it out without killing him? kim, there's something you- a man can't hate his son... to the end of his days. time's running out, susan. we've got to get together before it's too late. greg understands. then why doesn't he say so? why doesn't... susan. there's rust on his guns. he never would have stood for that in the old days. where is he, su? tell me. where is he? where's greg? kim? perry, where's greg? i don't know any way to soften this for you, kim. it's all over and done with. greg is dead. when? some time ago. what do you mean, ""some time ago""? kim, he... he died of a heart attack on the tennis court. how long ago? four years. october 10. four years? i was in rome. why didn't you cable me? why did you let me go on believing - look, it's a long story, kim. there was this feud between you two. we were afraid you might feel responsible. it did upset greg. he was awfully fond of- good lord, perry. what are you saying? you let me believe that he's been alive for four long years? and all the time i've been planning... to come back and make it up to him. so we were wrong. it seemed like the only thing to do at the time. try to understand, kim. i wish i could understand. look, kim, we should have told you. we didn't. and once we got started on this thing, we couldn't stop. it was a bad mistake. mistake? perry... look, kim. a heart attack? it was very sudden. yes, it must have been. he applied for his life insurance only five years ago. his heart was fine then. a coronary can hit anybody, any time. yes, and i suppose you and doug irwin... handled all the details of the estate? i don't like the way you said that. i don't like what i'm thinking. if you're wondering about the will... he changed it just after you... after you left. he left everything to me. congratulations. kim. good work. you've got it all. greg's love, greg's money, and my girl. kim. i'm so worried about him. what are we going to do? i don't know. well, he can't stay here. take it easy, darling. we'll get him away from here, somehow. he's up in greg's bedroom. he mustn't be in there. see what you can do. kim? kim. it's 7:00. would you like some food? please tell perry i'm sorry. i was just dreadfully shocked and upset. i know. you look so tired. would you like something to eat? no. i'm not hungry. why don't you take your old room down the hall? it's just like it used to be. nothing's like it used to be. please leave me alone. i've got to think. everything was here. greg's hunting prints... his books... his pipes... his papers... his hunting cap. everything was here except greg. there was an eternity between us now. his hunting license... filled out in his strange, careless handwriting. date.: october 11, four years ago. october 11? he went on a hunting trip on the 11th. why had perry told me he died on the tennis court on the 10th? doug irwin. hello! i went by your house. they told me you were here working late. join me? you know i didn't come here for a drink, don't you? yes. so you heard about greg? i heard he dropped dead after a hot set of tennis. yes. coronary. i warned him, but he wouldn't listen. little unusual, isn't it... seeing you curled up with a bottle of scotch? yeah. got a special reason tonight? you look just like your father. he never had heart trouble before, doug. at his age, you don't have to. you don't play tennis, period. he wasn't. you'd better have a drink. he took out this hunting license... the day after perry said he dropped dead on the tennis court. perry got his dates mixed. he said the 10th. it was the 12th. a day after he filled this out? yes. he took out a hunting license to play a set of tennis? we were going hunting. we called it off. why? bum weather. rained like the devil. but you played tennis? it let up after a while. astonishing how the courts dried off. doug - the death certificate is on file, my boy. gregory stanger, age 64. died october 12. cause: coronary thrombosis, acute. you can check with the constable at stangerford... you can check with the newspapers of that date. and you can check with the most critical authorities of all... greg's life insurance underwriters. you can buy a lot of affidavits for $3 million. where did you go on that hunting trip? kim, won't you take some advice from me? not as the family lawyer, but as your friend? forget it. let greg sleep. who killed him, doug? nobody killed him. he died on his own tennis court. i'll be back. where are you going? to find who killed him. hamlet and the ghost on the battlements. mr. stanger, there's nothing more to tell. it's getting late. there's a great deal more you can tell me. was my father's casket open or closed during the services? i don't remember. think, mr. eaton. think. closed. why? family's instructions. did you see the death certificate? yes. did you see the body? you can always check - you did see the body, didn't you? do you think... do you think my father died of a heart attack? as i said before, you can always check. i know very well whom i might check with. there's only one witness i'll believe. who? my father. mr. stanger, i - you run the cemetery, don't you? you have the key to the family crypt. are you suggesting i- i must have that key. get it for me. get it! i can't permit you to violate a grave, no matter what the reason! stop it! why? does it offend your taste? or are you afraid of something else? like perjury. how much did they pay you? how much, mr. eaton? i can't tell you anything about your father because i never saw him. why? we held services over an empty coffin. there's no body in the grave. why? i don't know where the body is. i simply did as i was told. as for the flowers, i was requested to send them to a place in sheridan falls. some place up in maine. i know where it is. please don't tell your brother. i don't know what he'd... going somewhere, kim? yes. i want you to change your mind. i want you to come home with me. i don't want to argue, kim. come on now, please. want to save me a trip? want to tell me about greg? there's nothing to tell. you know the story. all right. better gather up the clan now and make up a better story. i'll call you from sheridan falls. stanger, you say? gregory stanger. he was here about four years ago... on a hunting trip with a lawyer named irwin. were you coroner then, mr. dobbs? no. who was? george rutherford. what happened to him? retired. what were you doing here then? helping rutherford. i was the assistant here. you can't remember anything about a party of deer hunters... that checked in here around october 13 or 14? don't know. what do you mean, you don't know? long time ago. we get a passel of hunters through here in season. my memory's not as good as it used to be. it might need a little help. anything i can do to help? hell, no, i... i can't cross your palm like my brother does... but i've got something just as good. what happened to rutherford? what did he retire on? legacy from an uncle? let me go. i don't know anything about- you know about gregory stanger. now talk! we... we had a call that mr. stanger had a sick spell... and they hauled him back in his private plane. back to stangerford. there was some talk and george rutherford went up there to look into it... but nothing come of it. that's all i know. three went in, and two of them came out. three went in. i only heard. i wasn't there. there was stanger and irwin. who else? stanger's son. they went into tamarack lake. thirteen miles of rough mountain trail... between me and tamarack lake. i was exhausted, but something drove me on... 10 miles, 12. it was ahead of me. somewhere in the wilderness, the answer to everything. then i was there. kim... i've been waiting for you since noon. my dad's plane is down on the lake. let's go home. you won't stop me now. kim, for heaven's sake, listen to me. you've got to stop. please believe me. i've got to know. i came all the way from paris to settle this. i've got to know! listen to me. you've never been in paris. you've been in a hospital in arizona. what? you made it all up. all this about paris and rome... you believed it because you wanted to. when was i discharged from the hospital? you weren't. you ran away. greg was murdered. after it happened, perry and i arranged everything... so that it would appear that he died naturally. we bribed the undertaker. my dad helped with the death certificate. no one has any idea of the truth. we thought it was the only thing to do at the time. now i'm not so sure. susan, who killed him? you did, kim. it was an argument. a loaded hunting rifle. an accident. and after it happened... you went all to pieces. i thought so. i had a premonition. and as the cold new england sun... slowly sinks behind the coroner's office... we take leave of mysterious, far-off sheridan falls... land of enchantment. and as the night breeze carries our little craft away... from these beautiful wooded shores... we slowly turn our eyes back to the charms of television advertising... and the lyrical chant of our sponsor's message... after which i'll float back. i see it's time for our intermission. you may leave your seats if you wish... and have some light refreshment, chat with your friends... but please hurry back for our next play. that will be in just... one week. good night."

in coming to you i'm committing a breach of protocol. but you should know, someone should know. there's a problem with delenn. who are you? what do you want? who are you? what do you want? who are you? who are you? you were dreaming. yes. about what? you're thinking about escape again, aren't you? don't. there's no way off z'ha'dum. might as well give up. reconcile yourself as i did. first obligation of a prisoner is to escape. so... ...if one is a prisoner of love, one must escape to solitude? if one is a prisoner to joy, must one escape to sadness? i see you're still upset that i won't tell you my name. well, what does it matter? if i tell you my name is lorien... ...what good is that? it tells you nothing, but leaves me at a disadvantage. words have meaning. and names have power. the universe began with a word, you know. but which came first... ...the word or the thought behind the word? you can't create language without thought. and you can't conceive a thought without language. so which created the other... ...and thus, created the universe? no. i see you're far too wrapped up in your question... ...to consider the larger issues. what question? who are you? how did you know about...? it's a dangerous question, isn't it? there's never a good answer to it. i suppose that's the point. now, what you are... ...that's a question i can answer, at least in your case. you're dead. - that's enough. - how long have you been here? i don't know. - a day, maybe two. - the sun has risen and set nine times. you haven't eaten. you ought to be starving. are you hungry? thirsty? does blood still flow through your veins? does it? there's no pulse. because, my reluctant friend... ...you are quite... ...quite dead. it was the year of fire. the year of destruction. the year we took back what was ours. it was the year of rebirth. the year of great sadness. the year of pain. - and a year of joy. - it was a new age. it was the end of history. it was the year everything changed. the year is 2261. the place, babylon 5. - nothing to say about being dead? - it's a trick. is it? what is the last thing you remember before waking up here? i was falling. i fell... ...a long way. it seemed to go on forever. nothing goes on forever. not falls, not you, not i... ...not love, not life. entropy consumes everything. we all hit bottom... ...sooner or later. did you... ...hit bottom? i don't remember. there are only two possibilities: if you hit bottom then you are dead. if you did not hit bottom... ...you are still falling and all of this is a dream. unless... ...you're in between. - between what? - between moments. when we are born... ...we are allocated a finite number of seconds. each tick of the clock slices off a piece of us. tick. a possibility for joy is gone. tock. a careless word ends one path... ...opens another. tick, tock, tick, tock. always running out of time. yours is almost used up. you're between seconds... ...lost in the infinite possibilities between tick and tock. tick, you're alive. tock... well, it was a good life but a short one. tick, tock, tick, tock, tick... how do i know you're not behind all of this, huh? just what are you up to? who are you? who are you? what do you want? you're closer now, aren't you? yes, i see you are. but closer to tick or closer to tock? i don't know. only time will tell. and here... ...between the moments... ...we have all the time... ...in the world. you are isaac? i was told you might be able to give me some information. maybe. it depends. this was part of a starfury you sold to a trader on zafran 7. could be. i don't remember that particular piece. it's legal. it was salvaged. finders keepers, losers... ...buys them from finders. i'm told you salvaged this from an abandoned starfury... ...you found floating dead in sector 87. is that correct? there's a partial serial number on this piece. it matches the id number of a starfury... ...that belongs to a friend of mine. his name is michael garibaldi. he disappeared almost two weeks ago. - if this is from his ship... - i don't want to talk to you no more. a starfury drifting in the vastness of space is too small to run across by accident! - how did you know where to find it? - i got nothing to say to you. - how did you know? - i had a tip, okay? the man says he doesn't want to talk to you. leave him alone. we're having a private conversation. - it's no concern of yours. - it's my bar. i'm making it my concern. now, get out. i've come a long way. i intend to finish my conversation. i don't think so. such a negative personality. come on! not now. they're gone. but find out where they're staying. i might have something for you. yes? ambassador. sorry for not answering at once. i was meditating. is there a problem? well, you tell me. i hear you haven't had anything to eat or drink in almost seven days. minbari can fast as long as two weeks. a normal minbari, yes. but you're partly human now. your system can't handle the stress you're putting on it. if you don't stop, you're going to hurt yourself. look. look, i know this is how your people deal with grief, all right? you fast. you purify yourselves physically, spiritually. but nothing is going to be served by endangering your own life. justice is served. it is my fault that john is gone. my fault that the alliance against the shadows has crumbled. - that the heart has gone out of them. - delenn... for a long time... ...i was afraid his wife might still be alive on z'ha'dum, but i... i never asked. i never told him. i denied him the right to choose his actions wisely. i broke the trust between us. and when he learned the truth on his own... ...he didn't choose his actions. his actions chose him. and he went away. i have sometimes heard humans say: ""minbari never tell anyone the whole truth."" but i am no longer wholly minbari. i should have changed my heart more than i did. but i loved him, and i... i wanted to protect him. i should have loved him less and trusted him more. thank you for coming, stephen, but... ...my fast will continue. if john does not return from z'ha'dum, if he's... if he's dead... ...then my soul will join him even if i cannot. and as i promised him long ago... ...i will see him again... ...in the place where no shadows fall. good thing i went out on my own. you're rather difficult to hide. - how is it outside? - they're still looking for you. i don't think it would be safe for you to leave for a while. strange that they are still after us. the altercation was a small one. no one was harmed. it doesn't make sense. - you're right. that's the bit that worries me. - if you're going to be worried every time... ...the universe doesn't make sense, you'll be worried every moment... ...for the rest of your life. - your point being? my point being... why am i talking to you? and what are you doing here? i heard you were looking for mr. garibaldi on the assumption he was in trouble. so i went looking for you... ...on the assumption you'd probably get into trouble. i was doing fine until you showed up with that thing in hand. it's a minbari fighting pike, several hundred years old. you're just jealous because you don't have one. bad case of ""pikal"" envy if you ask me. so you think you have a lead on mr. garibaldi? if that was his starfury they found, then he may have escaped or been intercepted. i'll go back later and... i think it would be better if you let me do it. they seem rather eager to find you. eagerness like that... worries you. hell, i suppose i should appreciate your concern. compassion is a rare commodity these days. so why are you doing this? he's my friend. i've never had a friend before who wasn't a narn. and you? i've never had a friend before who was a narn. damn few of any other kind. most of them are dead. may i? to open it, you press... i like it. no. no. close, but too tall. you're sure it was a narn? what, did i suddenly become stupid overnight? of course it was a narn. it's not like they're easy to miss. no. no. that's him. that's the one. citizen g'kar. the last of the kha'ri still free. there's a reward for his capture... ...dead or alive. yeah? which pays the most? wakey wakey. i'm here with your weather report for the evening. i see rain... ...lightning, thunder... ...and your head nailed to that wall over there... ...if you don't tell me what my friend and i need to know. any questions? you wanted to see me. yes. ivanova wanted me to go through the captain's personal effects... ...and figure out what to keep and what to store. what to send back to his family. she... ...gave me the password to his personal log and other official files. i was looking through them when i found this. i thought you might like to take a look at that. i'll be outside when you're through. personal log, may 14, 2260. we actually had a quiet day today. it's hard to believe, with so much going on lately. and now that we've broken away from earth, everything has hit the fan. it's not what i wanted. frankly, it scares the hell out of me. but it had to be done. the job now is to... ...turn this around and make it into something positive. my dad always told me that's the only way you deal with pain. you don't surrender. you don't fight it. you turn it into something positive. he used to say: ""if you're falling off a cliff, you may as well try to fly. you've got nothing to lose."" in a way... ...i feel the same way about delenn. during the war, i fought minbari. i killed minbari. saw many of my friends die at minbari hands. here i am... ...in love with one of them. for a long time, i thought about not saying anything, but... ...the moment my heart crossed that line... ...there wasn't much i could do but see it through. yeah, i've fallen off one hell of a cliff. when i look in her eyes... ...i let myself think, maybe i really can fly. and according to our newfound friend... ...he was given the location of mr. garibaldi's starfury... ...by someone from interplanetary expeditions. did you get a name? montagne. that's all he had. so, what's our next step? after i get some sleep... ...l'll go back to the place where his ship was found. it's possible i may find more information. - you should go back to babylon 5 to... - no. i'm staying here with you. marcus, if you stay here, we'll never find out who and where this montagne is. we need babylon 5's resources for that. i'd rather not leave until i know you're safe... marcus. i am the last of the kha'ri. i fought in our war of liberation against the centauri. i can take care of myself. if you stay, i will be deeply offended. and there is little more inherently dangerous than an offended narn. - g'kar... - this is a personal mission for me. i must pursue it alone wherever that takes me. i need babylon 5's resources more than i need the company... ...however pleasant. all right. get some sleep. i'll send word if i find anything. thank you. thank you all for coming. from their beginnings, 1000 years ago... ...when they were first created by valen... ...the rangers have always been our first line of defense against the shadows. many of you have been working in dark places. your names and your work unknown to anyone outside. i hold before you a chance to shine in the night... ...to strike one last blow that will be heard and remembered 1000 years from now. the league of non-aligned worlds has collapsed... ...but there are a few among them who still believe in our cause... ...who would prefer to go down fighting, if that is to be our destiny. they need only a single rallying cry. i call upon you, upon the entire white star fleet, to be that voice. if others are afraid, then we'll show them what must be done. and if our deaths are required, they will at least light the way. we will attack z'ha'dum. the plan is to wait seven more days... ...so that any ships that wish to join us can arrive. then, with darkness before us and destruction behind... ...we will strike. our chances of success are small. but if we stay here and do nothing, they're even smaller. so we go. as a dear friend said to me: ""if you're falling off a mountain... ...you may as well try to fly."" here, at the end... ...i offer you one final chance to fly. what is it? what? what is it? just a moment. oh, mollari. do you know what time it is? yes, but the emperor was most insistent. he says you must come this moment. why? he does not reveal his mind to me, only his intentions. please, hurry. - all right. give me a moment. - oh, no... yes, yes, later. go. mollari, you've kept us waiting. i should be very upset with you. my apologies. before i entered your majesty's presence, i had to be properly attired... ...or it would be disrespectful. i see. then i should not have you killed for it? your majesty may act as he believes is correct... ...but i was motivated only by the respect to your position. i had your majesty's spirit in my heart. and so by killing me, you would also be killing a part of yourself. and as a loyal centauri... ...i would strongly object to that. well said. well said. i like you. i like you a great deal. did you know that? i feel we have so much in common. which is why i have secured you a gift. - a gift? - a gift. i wanted you to see it as soon as it arrived. - but it is unnecessary for you to... - nonsense! no one turns down one of my gifts. besides, i know you'll like this one. it's something you've wanted for a long, long time. would you like to see your gift now? - yes, majesty. - good. there he is, the last of the kha'ri. i know he's been a great burden to you. but now he's here for our amusement. and, well, when he ceases to be amusing... oh, mollari, have you nothing to say? yes, majesty. thank you. thank you for this... ...gift. and you. have you anything to say? do you, by any chance, happen to know... ...where mr. garibaldi might be? who? please restrain yourself, mr. garibaldi, or you will hurt yourself. - we can't allow that. - yeah, why not? - we have orders. - orders? whose orders? orders? whose orders? whose orders? we can't tell you that. you must know that by now. look, just, what do you want from me? we want to know what you remember after you were taken from babylon 5. i told you, i don't remember anything. your vital signs indicate you're being somewhat less than honest. you're just trying to avoid discomfort by telling us what you think... ...we want to hear. - why would i do that? maybe because you got me stuck in this tomb! i don't know where i'm at! maybe figuring out what you want is the only way out. - well, silly me! - don't think, mr. garibaldi. don't think, mr. garibaldi. just tell us the truth. - give me a break! - what happened after you left babylon 5? i told you i don't remember! - what happened after...? - i said, i don't remember! what happened? what happened? stop that, mr. garibaldi. stop it, mr. garibaldi. we can force you to behave. hello. hello, g'kar. you were foolish to leave babylon 5, you know. you had sanctuary there. as soon as you left, you were vulnerable. if you wished to die... ...you could have simply told me. i would have attended to it quickly. with at least a... a measure of dignity. but here... here... ...they will make you a toy. you will be tortured. you will be tortured for a very long time. i have seen them prolong suffering for days... ...weeks... ...months. and when they have finished... ...they will strap you to a table... ...not much longer than this bench. and they will make an incision here... ...just beneath the neck... ...and open you... ...all the way down. assuming you are still conscious, still entertaining... ...they will begin removing your internal organs... ...in pieces no longer than this. somewhere along the line... ...as they make a mountain of your parts and pieces... ...you will die. does this please you? no. no, it doesn't. once, long ago. no, not even then. you have never been a friend to me... ...but what he would do to you... ...i would not wish for anyone. there is a monster on the throne, g'kar. a well-protected monster. he must be removed. and you may be the means i have been waiting for. i believe i can save your life... ...but it will not be easy. and you will suffer greatly before this is over. i cannot help that. i wish i could. i have no desire to see you suffer. but i must watch. and you must endure until the time is right. and then i will act. and you will help me. yes? you didn't ask the price... ...for my cooperation. you are not exactly in a position to bargain, g'kar. neither are you. you want my help... ...for the sake of your people. i will give it... ...for the sake of my own. if i remove the monster from your throne... ...you will remove the monster... ...from my world. leave narn. set my world free. promise me this. and i will do as you ask. you have my word. this is the fire i set when i woke up down here. i've come full circle. don't we all? look. you've been down here longer than i have. - oh, much, much longer. - well, there must be some way out of here. tick, you're alive. tock, you're dead. the only way out is to surrender to tock. no. no, i can't do that! don't you understand? there's a war on out there. if we don't do something... ...billions of people are going to die. now, don't you care about that? yes, of course i care. it's a terrible thing when your children fight. i warned the others, but they didn't listen. they never listen. your children? metaphorically speaking. those who came after me. children. younger siblings. how long have you been here? a long time. so long. i was old when the molecules of your world joined... ...and called themselves land and sea and fish... ...and man. you're one of the first ones. no. not one of the first ones. i am... ...the first one. you know a way out of here, don't you? perhaps. then why are you still here? i'm waiting. - for what? - someone to talk to. you're the first to make it this far. do they know? of course. that's why they come back to z'ha'dum every time they're driven off. because i'm here. they think they're showing respect. they don't understand. they used to. but that was a long time ago. a million years. you don't look a... no, i don't. well, not at the moment. who are you? that was you. perhaps. we all have secrets and surprises. did you know you have a vorlon inside you? well, a piece of one. if you go to z'ha'dum, you will die. jump. jump now! kosh. is that its name? i think i met it once long ago. he told me to jump. - did he know? - that i was here? almost certainly. how did...? they can break off pieces of their consciousness... ...and put it into other organisms. it allows them to travel hidden through the galaxy... ...using others as their eyes and ears. kosh is in you. and he's part of the problem. you're the other part. you're both still clinging to life. both afraid to let go. you must lay down the burden of life, both of you... ...and surrender yourself to tock. no, i can't. the others need me. you can't turn away from death simply because you're afraid... ...of what might happen without you. that's not enough! you're not embracing life. you're fleeing death. and so you're caught in between... ...unable to go forward or backward. your friends need what you can be when you are no longer afraid. when you know who you are and why you are... ...and what you want. when you are no longer looking for reasons to live... ...but can simply be. i can't. i don't know how to do that. then i cannot help you. and you will be caught forever in between. you must let go. surrender yourself to death. the death of flesh, the death of fear. step into the abyss... ...and let go. it's getting darker. i know. you're close, friend. very close. it's easy to find something worth dying for. do you have anything worth living for? i can't see you anymore. as it should be. what if i fall? how will i know if you'll catch me? i caught you before. what if i die? i cannot create life... ...but i can breathe on the remaining embers. it may not work. but i can hope. hope is all we have. do you have anything worth living for? sleep now. i will watch and catch you if you should fall. delenn!

um... well... with someone else? once. with my old boyfriend sean. but look, that's ancient history, and we need some one-on-one time. i'm up for it if you are. i don't know. you'd probably be thinking of sean the whole time. oh, not the whole time. who ordered all these old-timey cars? the inhabitants of simian 7, the planet of the apes, and monkeys and tarsiers and several lemurs. all primates, really. hey, guys. we just stopped by to tell you we're taking some vacation days. no, you're not! you've got to go on this delivery! but we've earned these days off. we're not cattle, we're human beings. you're human beings?

how about you? sean, i'd like you to meet fry. he and i are... what would you say we are, fry? nude and interrupted. uh-huh. listen, leela, i'd love to catch up. what do you say we split a free drink at the robo bar? they've got unlimited pretzels. put a little peanut butter on there, they really fill you up. well, it has been a while. is it okay with you, fry? sure, that'd be great. i'll just sit here and feed the mosquitoes. i'm not sure this marmoset disguise is working. i'm not sure, either. we better ask amy. well, that's the last one. but what does a monkey financial services corporation want with a fleet of classic cars'?

please. it's been a long time. look at them. i came here to get romantic with the woman i love. instead, she's with her ex-boyfriend and i'm stuck with a pair of skilled mechanical hands. say, i don't suppose you're free later? then i have no choice. and now this part. if you want to steal my girl, you'll have to fight me for her. stop playing that lovely song and put up your dukes! fry, there's nothing to be jealous of. i've been sitting here paying my bills online. dude, you broke my reed! you owe me, like, a dollar! you'll have to kill me for it! just stop, you two! i've had that reed for 20 years! it's irreplaceable! i want my dollar! sean?

we better leave before they charge us for another day. grab some complimentary snacks and let's go! i'm drunk, i'm grouchy, and i'm gonna eat this peanut butter. want to watch? not really, but i will. fine. this is christopher colobus, the brave monkey who led a band of genetically engineered primates from earth to colonize our planet. wait, if you guys came from earth, why do you hate humans so much? oh, please. humans experimented on us, chained us to organ grinders, made us ride around in ridiculous tiny vehicles. you're still riding around in ridiculous tiny vehicles. by choice. come on, let's grab some lunch. it's all-you-can-eat, so just pick off whatever looks good. ew! gross! i'm gonna use the tongs. we have our own literature, music and art. the smear lines are impeccable. unlike your earth zoos, our zoo is a model of compassionate encagement. the animals don't even know they're in captivity. see? um... leela? i'm sorry i ruined our vacation. it's not your fault. i wanted this week to be special. and then sean had to show up. do you still have feelings for him? no. i mean, i'll always respect his frugality, but that's all. well, the important thing is we're finally alone. oh, your god! fry and leela are in a zoo! shh! oh, sorry. wow! those fireflies are going nuts. come here. i've always wanted to make love by bug-light. shmoly crap! we've got to get fry and leela out of this habitat before they humiliate themselves. please, amy, the act of love is a beautiful and natural... oh, my god, cover your eyes! come on, we better talk to the zoo director. mr. zoo director, we don't know you and you're facing away from us, but you have our friends caged up and... dr. banjo? the same. hang on. coming around. there. why, if it isn't professor farnsworth's friends. zoidberg, bender and... who is this fetching young marmoset? uh... sparkles? enough zoo director talk. we know those guys, and we want them freed. ah! yes, our famous human habitat. this pair have been our most popular specimens yet. especially the male. i've never seen one have so much trouble with zippers. as fun as it is to watch fry try and operate his pants, you can't keep him and leela here against their will. against their will? my good robot, they paid to be here. they think they're on a romantic holiday. humans have been vacationing in our habitat for years. in fact, leela's been here before. when her previous mate, sean, returned here with his current female, we quickly invited leela back as a behavioral experiment, keeping the first pair here under the pretext of shuttle repairs. the human exhibit has never been so popular, all thanks to your friends. well, that's that. what do you want to see next? we have a great maritime museum. shut up, guenter! you can't just put people on display. it's cruel. cruel? was it cruel when humans caged other primates in zoos for centuries? wait, i know the answer to this one. yes. look, we're all agreed humans are idiots. but these idiots are our friends. friends, eh? perhaps you wouldn't be so worried about them if you knew what they really thought of you. it's so great being away from everyone. zoidberg and his awful stench. stanky. bender and his obnoxious ego. but."" but."" and what about amy? always prancing around in those stupid marmoset pajamas. hey! you know who i hate most? that monkey we haven't seen in years, guenter. you see? observing animals yields critical scientific data. for example, that you, sparkles the marmoset, are in fact sparkles the human! wild human! wild human! dr. banjo, surely we can discuss this like recently civilized beings. cheese it! hurry! we still have to rescue fry and leela! even if my stupid marmoset pajamas offend leela's big fat eye. after they said i had an obnoxious ego? me, the magnificent bender? back! back, you beasts! follow me. the one who stinks, according to fry's delicate nose. this way. we can get in through the back of the human cage and... prairie elephant! adorable prairie elephant! okay, let's just get in, get out and... now what? now we wait for nature to take its course. how long does it take to pass through a moon worm? all right, let's just rescue them and get out of here. hooray, they're saved! and the robot hands would make you a strawberry shortcake any time of day. 4:00, 7:00, any time. no way! i'm not lying. also, leela and i... had a very nice, very private vacation. let's just leave it at that. can i tell them?

'cause every torpedo i got in the line is gonna get picked up the minute they find that old gleep. because you're not going to get picked up because you're nickel-and-dime and everybody knows it. you never did a job like this because you never could do a job like this, and that's why you're gonna do this one, jackie. and that's how you're going to get away with it. but, george, i got no guts. get guts, jackie! i don't care where from. you get them under the bed, you buy them from a vendor, you grow them in a pot. i don't care, but you get them, and you do the job. now, he closes that bar at 2:00. you be there when he's about to lock up, and you do it. and i'll be back here at 2:30, jackie. and if i find out that you welshed on me, jackie- that you chickened out- you're dead. hey... george. hey, george! george! george! please, george! look at you. look at you. what's the beef?

why am i, all the time, scared? i'm all the time scared. oh, man, i've had a long haul. how many nights in a tank? how many nights in stir? how many nights in a cheap, lousy little room like this? four bucks a night to roast to death. nail biter. scared, nervous little nail biter. hey, george! you ain't no judge of people, george! you ought to peel cantaloupes! you ought to stick with apples and oranges, george, because you ain't no judge of people! jackie rhoades the killer! hey, jackie rhoades, killer! i know you, jackie rhoades. you ain't no killer. but you got to kill tonight. kill or be killed. so you do the job and you're dead anyway, because you know you never got away with anything. you live till tomorrow, and that's how it ends. boy, i wish i could trade you in. no matches. cigarettes and no matches, that's me all over. that's jackie rhoades, the halfway boy. that's the story of my life. hello, jackie. come back here! you're not running out on me this time! you talking to me?

i'm you, jackie, and you're me. how's that? you're me and i'm you? oh, this is crazy. this is really crazy. this is crazy! crazy! jackie, i'm part of you, jackie. another part of you. don't you even remember me? you used to know me a long time ago, jackie. a very long time ago, you were up for grabs. you could have gone one way or the other. you could have gone my way or your way. you went your way. you know what that means, jackie? no, i don't. a cheap, weak, scared half vulture, all mouse. that's what you are, jackie. all right, so knock me. so i'm this and i'm that, and i'm this and i'm that. look, here, buddy, whatever i am, i got flesh and bones and i breathe. and. in just a couple of hours from now, i'm going to put the finger on somebody! so, ha-ha! what do you do for a living, huh?

oh, yeah, yeah, now i get it. i'm talking to myself. that's just who you are talking to- part of yourself- the part you never let come out. now, listen, buddy. you got no invitation to come out now, so you can go right back where you came from. who needs you? you do. you've always needed me. wait a minute. now i get it. yeah, now i get it. you're chicken, too. you're scared i'll get caught same as me. you're scared this is the last job, so you make a big noise like a conscience so the big man don't say you been goofing off all my life. it means more than that to me, jackie. you think i can keep quiet now while you go out and get us both killed? killed? that's right. you said so yourself- you never got away with nothing, and you know you won't get away with this. and i got a right to live. you had the same chances as me- no chance. so, if i'm wrong and you're right, then how come every move i made turned out wrong? how about that, huh? because, every time i tried to talk to you, you listened to somebody else. that was your mistake. okay, wise guy, you know so much, then how come you don't know the big thing? big thing? don't you ever look in a mirror? i was a runt. i was a skinny little runt. when you want to join a street gang, you got to go along with them. you back down, they give you business. they call you a chicken, and yell, ""you ain't got it!"" yeah, you went along with them. and you made me go along, too. the first time, we were ten years old. remember that? the class picnic? the teacher had a locket, and the catch broke, and she laid it down, and some of the big kids dared you to swipe it. well, i didn't want to swipe it. i told you, i was a runt. they dared me. and, a year later, they dared you to break into that grocery store with them, and you went along, and you dragged me along, too, and we got caught. and you spent the next 11 months in reform school, and so did i. what did that prove, jackie? yak, yak, yak, yak. talk my ear off. no wonder i cut you down. you're walking on your lower lip all the time. what do you want from me anyway? you know what i want. no, i don't but i'll tell you what i do know- i got to go out and do a job. i got to knock off an old gleep on 38th street. and, if i don't do it by 2:00 a.m., you can take what's left of me and scrape it off that mirror with a spoon! i ain't got much time. i got to go now. you got less time than you think. but you never had time. you didn't have time when that parole officer tried to help you. you could have listened to him, but you joined another gang. six months later, you were in jail again, and that parole officer couldn't help you any more than janey reardon could. janey reardon. janey reardon. janey reardon. she was a nice kid. she was a beautiful woman. she tried to set you straight. i loved her, jackie. i loved janey reardon. you loved her? you got a nerve. how could you love anybody? you're just a piece of glass. i could love, jackie. i could love. i needed her, jackie. so did you. i tried to tell you how much we needed her, but you graduated from the gang into the shakedown rackets. big shot, huh? two years we spent in the pen on that one. and, when we got out, janey reardon had gotten married and moved away. she walked out of your life, jackie. out ofourlife! you cheated me out of her. don't tell me your troubles. it's nothing to me. dames i can take or leave alone. dames you can take or leave, huh? that's a statement for the press. you wouldn't want to have a girl, would you, jackie? somebody sweet and pretty. somebody who would love you. somebody who'd be kind and gentle with you. you don't need that, do you, jackie? why don't you cut it out? will you do that? will you knock it off? what do you want from me anyway? i'm asking you, what do you want from me? i'm still waiting to hear. what do you want? i want to take over, jackie. i want to call the shots. i want you to let me out. i want a chance to live. i want to live with all the guts and goodness you left behind. i want to live the dreams you dreamed and never had the guts to live. fat chance, buster. big fat chance. i'm me and you're you! and that's no statement for the press. that's the goods. i'm going out and knock me off an old man now, and i'm going to cut me a nice slice of cabbage for my troubles. i'm calling the shots! and neither you or anybody else is telling jackie rhoades what to do! neither you or anybody else! yeah? oh... yeah, george. uh... george, i'm doing what you told me, george. i'm just on my way out now. yeah, george. i'm just leaving. yeah. honest, george. honest. i'm... i'm... i'm on my way now. yeah. yeah, i'm... i'm... i'm going to leave right now, george. i'll meet you back here at 2:30, okay?

what have you got to say for yourself? what have i got to say for myself, george? not much. i resign. that's it, george. i resign. you what? i resign. you can have your gun back, plus the following. move out, george. and don't ever come back... for anything. room clerk, this is jackie... this is john rhoades, room 14. i'm checking out. no, i'm not coming back. no, as a matter of fact, nothing's all right. the room's too hot, too small and too dirty. it's just the place for bums, but not for me. hey, hey, what's to do now? what's to do now? now we go look for a job. now maybe we get married. now maybe we stop biting our nails. exit mr. john rhoades, formerly a reflection in a mirror, a fragment of someone else's conscience, a wishful thinker made out of glass, but now made out of flesh, and on his way to join the company of men. mr. john rhoades, with one foot through the door and one foot out of the twilight zone. rod serling the creator oftwilight zone, will tell you about next week's story after this word from our alternate sponsor. and now, mr. serling. these are familiar items, i'm sure- television set, electric razor, clock, typewriter- the normal, everyday accoutrements that are part and parcel of 20th century progress. but, next week, you'll see them under different circumstances, and in a totally dissimilar guise. they'll be machines, but they'll also be monsters. our story is called a thing about machines, and it will be here waiting for you in the twilight zone. seethe new andy griffith show each week over most of these stations. consult local listings."
1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"good evening. i can tell by the rude noises you are making that you are impatient to see our film. however there will be a slight delay. is there a barber in the house? if there is, will he please report to the projection booth? our projection has seemed to have caught his moustache in a sprocket. of course, it could have been worse. the popcorn machine might have broken down. as you know our theatre spares no expense to make you television addicts feel at home. our movies are the oldest that money can buy. and tonight as a special attraction we shall present some television commercials. i knew you'd like that. they will be injected at various points during our picture to keep you from getting too engrossed in the story. i understand they are very good at relieving tensions and furnishing comic relief. and now, if you will quiet down, we shall begin our program. we are bringing you the music of ronnie temple and his orchestra directly from the ballroom of the langdon hotel in bywater. ronnie and the boys will now play a little foxtrot for you. hello there! having a spot of trouble? sorry to disturb you but you'll have to pull over. i can't get past. well! where's arthur? hasn't he arrived yet? no, he hasn't, and you know i have to be home by 11:00. well, i've done all i can. i rang 40 minutes ago and he said he was coming straight here by the short cut. hello, phyllis. you still here? i thought your husband had rescued you by now. no, we haven't even seen arthur. my sister will catch it from dad if she's not home in 20 minutes. that's no problem. i can drive you home myself if you'd like. how about that? thanks, jack. oh, but what about arthur? look, i can tell the doorman i've taken you home, shall i? okay, that's fine by me. how about you, aileen? all right. fine. if only you two would get your coats, i'll bring the car around. fine, thanks. come on. made off with my drink, charlie? no, sir. i saved it for you. thanks. if you think i don't need it, you try getting out on that floor for three in a row. me? i'm a wreck just listening to it night after night. thank you, sir. arthur! arthur! arthur isn't home yet. you did leave word for him? i said i would, didn't i? come, i'll wait with you. there isn't a thing to worry about. i can't imagine what's happened to arthur. i told you not to worry about it. but i am worried. he might have had an accident or something, or gone into the ditch. he might even have had a heart attack and at his age it could be fatal. it doesn't matter whether it's an accident or a heart attack as long as it is fatal, does it? oh, what a ghastly thing to say. what's so ghastly about it? how many times have you said yourself it would be an act of mercy to put him out of his misery. i may have said it. what do you mean, may have? well, i didn't mean it. wanting your own husband dead. it's wicked. now wait a minute. you can't back out of it now. how many times have you said that he was old and decrepit and jealous, and if only he'd curl up and die we'd have our chance. but you couldn't have thought i was serious! of course i thought you were serious! i thought you wanted him out of the way. that's why i killed him. that's why you what? that's why i killed him. oh, no. now, phyl. no! phyl, stop it. i only did what you wanted! i didn't i didn't want him dead. it's too late. he is dead. don't you understand? now, phyl, listen. now, the police will come at any moment. they may be here any minute. you've got to keep your head! phyl, sweetheart, listen, you've got to know what to say. if the police come now we'll both be in the dock. me? but i didn't do anything. but you did. don't you remember? you telephoned him and you told him to come and pick you up, and to take the short cut. that makes you an accessory, phyl. an accessory. and it won't do you any good to say you didn't know what was going to happen. if i'm arrested, phyl, you will be arrested too. me? me arrested? now, darling, you know why i did this. so that we could be together. you were unhappy with arthur, you know you were. and i couldn't stand that. i love you, darling. there isn't anything in the world i wouldn't do to make you happy. poor, jack. oh, you did mean well. oh, and you did it for my sake. i can't very well hate you for it, can i? well, i hoped you won't. but it was wrong, terribly wrong. poor, jack, i can't let you go to prison, can i? don't worry. when the police come i'll tell them everything... just the truth, darling. just tell them everything exactly as it happened. yes. except, of course, that i killed arthur. if you try to lie to them they're sure to find out, they always do, and they'll be suspicious. now, look, i've taken care of everything. all you have to do is to tell them the truth and stick to it. you understand? yes, jack. i'll do exactly as you tell me. that's my girl. jack, where... is he in the car? no. and you must keep your mind off it till you hear about it from the police. all right. but you did see my crocodile dressing case in the car, didn't you? arthur was bringing it back from the shop where he had taken it to be repaired. yes, it's there on the seat. and that purple scarf, too. well, i wish you'd brought it with you. didn't occur to me at the time. listen. i think it's the police. now this is it. do you think you can bring it off? yes. yes i have to, for your sake. oh, good evening. mrs. arthur chaundry? yes, i'm... is there something wrong? well, i'm superintendent karsiak, mrs. chaundry, and this is sergeant rason. how do you do? would you mind if we came in for a moment? no, no, of course not. please come in. but if there's something wrong, i wish you'd tell me. i know it's late, mrs. chaundry, but we'll make this as brief as possible for you. yes of course. this way please. oh, this is an old friend of ours, mr. lyons. superintendent karsiak. good evening, sir. good evening. mrs. chaundry, does your husband own a sedan, license number... hac-4745, sir. yes. yes, that's our car. what's happened? has there been an accident? is arthur all right? no. i'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, mrs. chaundry, but your husband is dead. oh, arthur. oh, jack! i'm so sorry. oh, jack. i'm so sorry. here, take the handkerchief. what happened? he was attacked on a deserted road leading to bywater. you wouldn't happen to know what he was doing there, mrs. chaundry, would you? yes. yes, he was coming to get me from the langdon. i'd gone there to a dance with my sister. mr. lyons? oh, i'd like to explain that, superintendent. mrs. chaundry rented a car from me. lyons' garage. as i was going to the langdon myself tonight, i said i'd drive her instead of one of my staff. well, when we arrived there mrs. chaundry was naturally a little upset in case i was mistaken for her escort. i must say it had never occurred to me. but i saw it might upset her, so i suggested that she telephone her husband. oh, yes. but what we don't quite understand is why was he coming by way of the lane instead of the main road. that's because he wasn't coming from here. he was at the greenfellows' club, he's the treasurer. oh. then it's possible he was carrying considerable cash? oh, yes. your husband's wallet appears to be missing. was anything else stolen? what? my crocodile dressing case, it was in the car, wasn't it? why, what makes you think so, mrs. chaundry? oh, but it must have been, because my husband told me on the telephone he was bringing it back from borota's in regent street. he'd taken it there to be repaired. there was a scratch on the leather. a crocodile dressing case with real gold fittings. we found nothing in the car except a purple scarf. well, then it's been stolen. you must get it back for me, superintendent, because it cost l200. well, the sergeant will get a full description of it and we'll try and get it back for you, mrs. chaundry. also find out who killed your husband. oh, arthur! oh, the coroner will inform you of the time of the inquest. good night, mrs. chaundry. good night, mr. lyons. you said it was in the car. what did you do with it? i left it there, just as i told you. all i took was his wallet. i threw that in the ditch and i burned the money. then what's happened to it? i wish i knew. i wish i knew. the coroner's jury today returned a verdict of murder by person or persons unknown in the death of mr. arthur chaundry. hello? hello, phyllis. what's the matter? that's what i called to ask you. you paid absolutely no attention whatsoever to me at the inquest today. and why didn't you see me home? darling, i couldn't. it would have started all sorts of scandal. well, if i can't see you here, where can i see you? we can't meet anywhere. not until it's safe. and it isn't a good idea to phone me either. phyllis... why, jack lyons! what a surprise seeing you. i had no idea you were in town. oh, aileen, you remember jack lyons, don't you? how do you do. hello. imagine seeing you. we just came to town to do some shopping and i remembered that someone had recommended this restaurant and, well, here we are. won't you sit down? no, thank you, we just stopped in for tea. phyllis. i might just sit down just for a moment. what a nice coincidence. it's not a coincidence and you know it. you're going to ruin everything if you're not careful. oh, relax. nobody knows us here except aileen and she thinks it was an accident. how soon can we be married? well, as soon as it's safe. people usually wait a year. oh, jack, a year! i'd go mad if i had to live in that house on my own. you don't have to stay there. you've got plenty of money. why don't you take a holiday, go to torquay? torquay? darling, i'm only thinking what's best for you. oh, all right. i'll go to torquay. but you'll write to me every day, won't you? i won't write to you at all and you won't write to me either. the police would only have to get hold of just one letter and we'd be sunk. oh, the police. they haven't done a thing. i had my solicitor write them a letter the other day. you did what? well, they haven't found my dressing case. i don't think they're even trying. phyl, for heaven's sake drop it. what are you trying to do? give them a chance to forget about it. now you're angry with me. no, i'm not. honestly, i'm not. only, you scare me. you're like a child. the sooner we get married the safer we'll be. phyl? phyllis? yes. will you get me a cup of tea, darling? oh, how much longer are you going to be on those old books? i've got to see if they balance out. couldn't you do them another time? i want to go dancing. with the auditors coming? they don't take excuses, you know. oh, that's silly. it's your garage. if they don't like the way you... look, phyl, let me handle the business. you've got no head for it. but i bought a new dress and i want to wear it. i thought you went to a matinee with your sister. we did. and i went shopping and i went to scotland yard. well, then you must be... you went where? scotland yard. what in heaven's name did you do that for? well, i went to see if they got my dressing case. superintendent karsiak hasn't done a thing about it. now, phyl, will you forget about that blasted dressing case? if you keep nagging about it you'll upset everything. jack! just 'cause karsiak never found out who did arthur in, don't think he's forgotten about it. and if you bring scotland yard into this, we'll never be safe. but you know how much that dressing case means to me. then buy yourself one. you've got plenty of money now. i don't want another one, i want the one arthur gave me! phyl, i swear i don't understand you! you were fed up with arthur, all you talked about was getting rid of him, and now that he's gone you go all soft and sentimental about him. oh, you don't understand. there was a time when we were first married, arthur was very devoted to me. he was very kind and very considerate. that's when he gave me the dressing case. it's only natural that i should be sentimental about it. now listen to me, my girl. i'm giving you fair warning. you forget about that dressing case or we'll both regret it! what a thing to say, certainly not. i think you're positively wicked. oh, i didn't say never. oh, you never can tell. oh, i've got to go now. yes, i've got to say goodbye. goodbye, wilfy. who were you talking to? wilfy. who's he? oh, you know who wilfy is. i met him when i was in torquay. darling, i'm sorry about last night. i shouldn't have lost my temper like that. jack, darling, that's all right. i knew you didn't want to hurt me. i'm not angry with you. really i'm not. it's just that i forget sometimes that certain things are important to women. well, i have to learn to accept you as you really are. anyway, i went up to regent street today and look. oh, jack, darling! oh, it's a dressing case just like my other one. you know how i adore crocodile... oh, it isn't crocodile. no it isn't, but i got it at borota's. and it cost a fortune. it isn't the same. well, i didn't want anything to remind us of... remind us of what? maybe you can forget about arthur but i can't and nor can the police. i won't have the word crocodile mentioned again in this house. and if you don't like it you can take if back to the shop or give it to your sister or throw it away! don't you speak to me like that. i won't have it. you're not the only man in the world, you know. there are plenty of other people that could be nice to me. people have been nice to you all your life. your father spoiled you, and so did arthur and i've had a year of it. and if you think your friend wilfy can do any better for you, you'd better go to him. he certainly could, he could do a lot better. he wants me to tour the continent with him. oh, he does, does he? yes. well, as far as i'm concerned the sooner you get started, the better! come in! whoever you are. good evening, mr. lyons. i do apologize for calling so late. who says it's so late? i don't say it's so late. i would like a word with your wife, if i may. in that case it is too late. oh, well, if she's retired... she has retired, retreated, fallen back, all the way to the continent. dunkirk in reverse. dunkirk in reverse! well, perhaps it's just as well. i'm gonna be honest with you, mr. lyons. your wife's been giving us a lot of trouble. seems she went to scotland yard about that dressing case of hers, you know, the one that disappeared at the time of the murder. oh, it's bad enough having an unsolved murder on your hands. now we've got the yard looking over our shoulders. you won't have any more trouble because she isn't coming back. oh, i'm sorry to hear that. just when it looks as if we may have found her dressing case. you found it? uh-huh. no credit to us. though i will say we worked hard. we had a bit of luck. you know, one of those freak things there's no accounting for. seems as if a truck, a six tone truck, mr. lyons, backs into a cottage in wiltshire, and in the debris is a chest full of stolen goods. well, i suppose you got to give the wiltshire police credit for being on their toes. if you can find the thief... oh, we've got him. a tramp named dan mintz. he swears he was in scotland at the time of the murder, but we've got reason to believe he was not only here, he was employed as a car washer in your garage. was he? what was his name again? mintz? mintz, mintz, mintz... i don't remember anybody with that name. well, they come and go at the garage, you know. perhaps if you saw him you could identify him. that's all we'll need considering his past record to put him right where he belongs. you mean that'll be enough to prove that he murdered chaundry? that and the dressing case. just give me a second to wash my face and i'll come along with you. well, what do you say, mr. lyons? yes, that's him all right. he did some day work for me last summer. any of the boys at the garage will bear me out. all right, all right! i worked for him. but i never so much as pinched a spanner. that's all. take him away. come along, mintz. no, let me go! it wasn't me. i tell you i never even had a pint of bitter. come along. comes a bit hard, eh, mr. lyons? well, it does, you know. sending a man to prison. oh, it's old stuff to mintz. he spent half his life behind bars. well now, we've established his presence. if this is your wife's dressing case, we'll have the whole thing buttoned up. no, that's not it. it isn't? but are you sure? of course i'm sure. no, she had her initials ""p. c."" cut in the side. now look here, mrs. chaundry, as she was then, gave the sergeant a detailed description and there was no mention about any initials. she must have forgotten, she usually does forget the most important thing. no, her case had the initials ""p. c."" phyllis chaundry. right there. like this? yes, yes. that's the one. what's all this about? sorry, sir, but your memory could have played you tricks, you know, and we're dealing with murder here. yes, of course. had to be quite sure you knew about those initials which your wife forgot to remember. you see, mr. lyons, she didn't know they were there. that's absurd. i mean, it's her case, isn't it? it is. then what's all the fuss about? because you couldn't have known those initials were there unless you'd seen the case in chaundry's car. that's absurd. i've been at the house many times, i've often seen the case. possibly, but not with the initials ""p. c."" you see, the shop only put them on there to cover up a tear in the leather, the same day chaundry picked up the case to take home to his wife. so, you see, it wasn't possible for you to have seen those initials at any other time or any other place. and now for the information of you youngsters who were slashing the upholstery and tearing out the seats during the denouement. i would like to tidy up one of the story's loose ends, phyllis chaundry. she was arrested as an accessory and she and her husband jack both went to prison. an inspiring example of togetherness. and now as a means of clearing the theatre without calling the police here is another commercial from the land of television after which i shall roll back. i'm sure you will be interested in knowing that the soundtrack of the three commercial scenes tonight are available in the album music to cook three minute eggs by. the album is available in all speeds including reverse. as well as in fi, both high and low. next week we shall have a completely new attraction as well as new seats and fresh popcorn. good night."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"captain's log, stardate 54208.3. last month's datastream from starfleet never arrived, so the crew is looking forward to this one with even more anticipation than usual. we could all use some news from home. ah. there he is, the man of the hour. you sure are in a good mood. well, rumor has it you snared the latest datastream last night. technically, it was this morning-- 0200 to be exact. so where's my mail? hmm? oh. don't tell me you lost another one. l didn't lose last month's datastream. lt never arrived. so what's the holdup this time? the transmission was a little larger than usual. lt's jammed the transceiver. seven and l have been up all night trying to download it. harry... we can't go another month without mail. oh, you won't. trust me. any luck? l've determined why we've been having difficulties. a hologram. the transceiver wasn't designed to store photonic data. we have to get it out of there before it degrades. what are you doing? tying the transceiver into the holodeck's pattern buffer. those systems aren't compatible. you'll depolarize the relays. starfleet wouldn't have sent this hologram if it weren't important. l'm sure it's worth a few burnt-out relays. you've overloaded the transceiver. but l saved the hologram. okay, ready when you are. lieutenant barclay? uh... no, but he did design me. l'm a walking, talking, problem-solving interactive hologram. you can call me reg. lt's nice to meet you, reg. the pleasure's mine, captain. harry, seven... l've been looking forward to working with you. you have? l know-- you were expecting letters from your friends and families. but with any luck, in a few days, you'll be seeing them face-to-face. ln three days' time, voyager is going to be passing through grid 898-- a sector of space occupied by a red giant star. sensors detected it a few days ago. at this very moment, a team of federation scientists is orbiting another red giant in the alpha quadrant. ln 72 hours, they will target its magnetic field with a verteron beam, creating a geodesic fold. as a result, a corresponding fold will open here in the magnetic field of the red giant that voyager is approaching. space will be punctured... these two points creating a gateway between the quadrants. our shields are useless against geodesic radiation. we toyed with the idea of opening a fold ourselves, but it didn't take us long to realize we wouldn't survive the trip. a lot's happened in geodesic research since you've been gone. l've brought schematics for shield upgrades to deflect the radiation from the fold, medical technology to provide additional protection for the crew. we've thought of everything. starfleet never mentioned you in any of the previous datastreams. well, lieutenant barclay didn't want to raise your hopes, in case the plan didn't live up to expectation, but lucky for you, it surpassed them. what about last month's datastream? why didn't we receive it? pathfinder tried sending an unabridged version of my program. lt overloaded the mldas array. and the only casualty this time was our transceiver. lf everything goes according to plan, you won't need it anymore. lf we were to attempt this, you'd need access to areas of this ship that aren't equipped with holo-emitters. not to worry, captain. we've thought of that, too. my emitter is your emitter. computer, transfer the barclay hologram to the mobile emitter. transfer complete. on lieutenant barclay's behalf, l thank you. just make sure to return it when we get to earth. we're ready for you in the briefing room, captain. excuse us, doctor. l'm sure you have a full day planned, but if you have time, l'd like to get better acquainted. l'll stop by the first chance l get. you'll know where to find me. this is our destination-- red giant 23139. the geodesic fold will open here, adjacent to the giant's northern pole. we'll have exactly 16 seconds to take voyager through. reg has prepared a list of assignments. l expect you to give him your full cooperation. mr. paris, you have the honor of plotting our course to big red 2. lieutenant torres, commander tuvok, l'd like you to start working on shield modifications. and in the meantime, l've asked the doctor to prepare a series of inoculations that will protect the crew from the radiation. we should discuss the possibility of applying borg technology to starfleet's plan. lt could increase our chances of success. l look forward to hearing your thoughts. how long before the transceiver's back on line? no more than two hours. then we'll still have time to transmit a response to starfleet. keep us posted. l'd like to send lieutenant barclay a little thank-you note for all his hard work. um, uh, is there... is there anything l can do, reg? your job might be the most important one of all. the next few days will be difficult. the crew will be working extremely long hours. they're going to need an experienced morale officer to keep their spirits high. you can count on me. lf this were any other ship... l'd have my doubts. but this is voyager, ''the miracle ship.'' you've survived six years in the delta quadrant. you've evaded the kazon, the vidiians, the hirogen. you've even faced down the borg. l think, with a little teamwork, we can pull off one more miracle and take voyager home. l can taste my mom's cooking. don't forget what the hologram said, harry: ''this is voyager... ''the miracle ship''! uh, not when it comes to getting us home. our shortcuts have a tendency to blow up in our faces. well, that's looking on the bright side. well, remember arturis and his quantum slipstream drive? or, um, or how about the telepathic pitcher plant that made us think we were on our way home right before it tried to eat the ship. this is the best opportunity we've had. yeah, which is why we'll probably end up in the gamma quadrant. l'll remind you of that when we get back to earth. don't say l didn't warn you. when a borg cube enters a transwarp conduit, it's subject to extreme gravimetric shear. to compensate, the borg project a structural integrity field ahead of the cube. by modifying voyager's deflector, we may be able to do the same. no one at starfleet would have thought of this. so, what's the first thing you're going to do when you get back? begin repairs to voyager. even with the structural integrity field, it's likely the ship will suffer significant damage. yes, but, l mean, there are people at utopia planitia who will take care of that. there are engineering crews and technicians... are you implying that l am superfluous? of course not. l only meant that if you're too busy working, you're going to miss all the ''welcome home'' hoopla. starfleet's planning parties. they'll have ceremonies and speeches. there, there's a ticker-tape parade down market street. l won't be attending any of those events. but you'd be the guest of honor. when l first arrived on voyager, it was difficult for the crew to accept me. l'm anticipating a similar welcome on earth. you don't have any idea, do you? l didn't mention this earlier. l didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings... but you are the one who people are most looking forward to seeing. that's difficult to believe. why? l was borg. exactly. you were borg, but you escaped. and despite incredible odds, you managed to reclaim your humanity. no one's ever done that before. you're famous. fame is irrelevant. maybe... but you've given hope to everyone who's ever lost somebody to the borg. you've inspired millions. lf you think my participation in the ''hoopla'' would be beneficial to others, then l'll comply. ls this going to take much longer, reg? well, the computer is still inputting data. that should do it. all right. computer, display the intended trajectory of the datastream transmitted at 0600 this morning. now, display the actual trajectory and identify the termination point. the trajectory ends in sector 395... 42, grid 8. does that sound familiar? that's exactly where the datastream dissipated last month. there is something there. there is something preventing the datastream from reaching voyager. uh, a micro-wormhole, a radiogenic field... long-range scans didn't pick up anything unusual. well, still, we could send a ship to investigate. we could confirm my theory. what about my theory, reg? the hologram was too complex. lt caused the data streams to degrade before they reached their destination. well, to be honest... l... l don't agree. the truth is, we don't know what happened to my hologram. then let's stick to what we do know. for the second month in a row, we tried sending your hologram to voyager. and for the second month in a row, it failed to get there. and l want to know why, so it doesn't happen a third time. lt won't happen a third time. next month, we go back to standard transmissions. but a holographic matrix carries twice the information, interact with the crew... admiral paris wants us to send more practical data, like tactical upgrades, letters from the crew's families. but, pete... sending a hologram to voyager was a good idea, but it didn't work. lt's time to move on. and this is the research lab, where most of pathfinder's homework gets done. all the datastreams are compressed here and then transmitted all the way to the delta quadrant. your teacher tells me you've been studying some of the delta quadrant races that voyager has described to us. who can name one for me? the talaxians. very good. the ocampa. that's right. who else? the borg! the borg! they assimilated my hologram. that's how it disappeared. reg, now isn't the time. look at this-- last month, a spacecraft passed within 20 meters of the mldas array, just hours before we sent the first hologram. what is your point? 20 meters. lt's awfully close, don't you think? ensign. look, the borg must have sent a transwarp probe to steal my hologram. maybe because they, they thought that it was carrying anti-borg technology to voyager. lt wasn't the borg, reg. then it was the romulans using a cloaked ship. they've been curious about voyager for years... that is enough. but, you... l am sorry your idea didn't work, but l can't have you going off on a tangent. not again. you'll be no good to pathfinder or voyager. how much leave do you have saved up? not that much. 50... maybe 60 days. take a week, go home. try to relax. but, pete... no. that was not a request, lieutenant. maybe l'll go somewhere... take a vacation. now that is the most sensible thing l've heard you say all day. my cousin has a beach house in malaysia. she'd be happy to lend it to you. thanks, um, but l have someplace else in mind. you, you wanted to see me? l've been going over the instructions from starfleet medical. as far as l can tell, their ''new'' inoculations aren't much different from run-of-the-mill radiogenic vaccines. l don't think they'll protect the crew. did you try incorporating a synthetic antigen? yes, but it only improved the resistance by 10 percent. that should be enough. we can't afford to be cavalier, reg. lf these treatments don't work, the crew will wind up liquefied. you're forgetting that the inoculations aren't designed to work alone. they were intended to work in combination with the shield modifications. lt's the medicinal ''ying'' to the shields' ''yang.'' a-and what if the ''yang'' doesn't work? that's not going to happen. now, listen, lieutenant barclay has a special affinity for this crew. so do l. l promise you, we won't let them down. of course you won't. tell me... do you also share lieutenant barclay's affinity for golf? we have identical handicaps. well, if you're not busy later, perhaps we could play nine holes on the holodeck. eh, it's tempting, but l still have a few dozen progress reports to look over. well, in that case, maybe you could look over them here, so that l could borrow the mobile emitter. providing that the rest of the day's work goes smoothly, consider it yours. l... l thought it was mine. commander chakotay tells me that you finished repairing the transceiver. we were just about to send the captain's reply to lieutenant barclay. do you have enough room to include a progress report from me? l think we can squeeze that in. computer, download barclay hologram file 01 to the data block. download complete. transmitting. lt's about time. greetings from the delta quadrant, lieutenant. you'll be happy to know that your hologram reached us safely... get to the important part. ln accordance with the 7 4th rule of acquisition-- ''knowledge equals profit'' l've enclosed the specifications you've requested. see you soon. oh, look at those hands. l bet she gives great oo-mox. too bad she'll be dead when she gets here. forget the hands. show me the nanoprobes. how many are there? 3.6 million. that's 20 percent more than we predicted. 3.6 million nanoprobes at six bars of latinum per unit. uh, that comes to... more profit than we ever dreamed of. your drink, sir. thank you. thank you. something to drink, ma'am? l'm fine, thanks. are you sure? l've got a chocolate passion punch with your name on it. reg? surprise. where's commander riker? he doesn't arrive until friday. oh. the question is: what are you doing here? just had some time off. your letter made this place sound fun, and just thought l'd join you. do you have any idea how inappropriate it is to follow your therapist on vacation? please. they might be watching. who? the borg, the romulans. l'm not sure yet. please... deanna, l need your help. commander harkins is usually willing to hear me out, but this time, he wouldn't even look at my evidence. l'm not sure any of this qualifies as evidence, reg. you don't believe me, either. you think l'm imagining this? just like pete? the last time l saw you, you were laughing, telling jokes. you even sang a duet with data. that was commander la forge's birthday party. you were a completely different reg that night. oh. things were better then. how? well, for one thing l had just finished the matrix for my hologram, and l showed geordi some of the specs that night. he said he was proud of me. what else? oh... the dragons had just won the pennant, and l was still seeing leosa. you mentioned her at the party. a teacher, right? everything was going so well-- my job, my personal life. l started to think maybe my luck was changing. and then you lost your hologram. admiral paris was furious. he said we'd, we'd wasted a transmission to voyager. pete talked him into giving us another chance, but there was so much pressure after that. did it put a strain on your relationship with leosa? she left me. oh, l'm sorry. l went to her apartment. she was gone. there was no furniture, no forwarding address, not even a ''dear reg'' letter. that must have been very upsetting. mmm. lt's just my luck, right? lose the hologram and the girl. tell me more about leosa. oh. you would have liked her. she was sweet, she was thoughtful and such a wonderful listener. she would let me, let me go on for hours. what did you talk about? oh. she was fascinated by my work at pathfinder and, uh... she didn't, uh... she didn't find any of it boring. she made me feel interesting. what do you feel when we talk about her now? um, sadness, l suppose. a little confusion. l'm sensing something else... something beneath the surface. what? l think you might be sensing it, too. what? suspicion, reg. you suspect her of something. l suspect that she's happier without me, if that's what you mean. you think leosa had something to do with your disappearing hologram, but you can't bring yourself to admit it. that's why you're projecting your suspicions onto others. you're in denial. lf there's any chance leosa did breach pathfinder security, you need to tell your superiors. l-l'd be humiliated... again. l'll go with you. what about your vacation? l'll be back here before will arrives. do you really think it's possible that leosa stole my hologram? why would she do that? maybe... maybe she wanted something to remember me by. captain's log, supplemental. with the help of the barclay hologram, we've nearly completed the modifications to voyager. as for reg, he's becoming extremely popular with the crew. lmagine my disappointment when l discovered that lieutenant paris had eaten all the scrambled eggs. lt was pure, unadulterated gluttony, gastronomic conduct unbecoming a starfleet officer. he knows it's my favorite breakfast, but he ate them anyway. we have an egg-mergency here, people. l want to know what you plan to do about it. maybe l can replicate some more, captain. do it. thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. he's not only programmed to get us home, he does impressions. you see, it's always bothered lieutenant barclay that he was uncomfortable in large groups. so he designed me to be the life of the party. l hope he's not too shy. he's going to have 150 new friends when we get back home. lf we get home, harry, if. pardon my friend here. he's convinced we're destined to live out our days in the delta quadrant. your pessimism is illogical. perhaps a mind-meld would help to alleviate your concern. sick bay to reg. please report to holodeck 2. on my way. l was starting to think you'd forgotten our tee time. so, what'll it be? pebble beach at sunset? the back nine at gedi prime? actually, doctor... l'm afraid something's come up. l'm going to meet with seven of nine. oh, really? she's going to teach me to play kadis-kot. uh, reg... when l agreed to lend you my emitter, l did it with the understanding that you needed it for official business. what's your point? my point is that board games aren't exactly crucial to your mission. and l suppose golf is? reg... l'll tell you what. when we get back home, we'll play as much golf as you like. until then, let's try to keep out of each other's hair. what do you say? state your name for the record. leosa. l-e-o s-a. occupation? dabo girl. dabo? lt's a ferengi game. l work aboard one of their casino ships. you, you told me you were a teacher. ls this true? sometimes l'm a teacher. sometimes l'm a bajoran vedek. whatever the customer wants. lieutenant barclay tells me that the two of you have spent a significant amount of time together. did he ever discuss his work at pathfinder with you? oh. wouldn't talk about anything else. lt was always holograms this and cyclic pulsars that. and who did you share that information with? nobody. l have a theory. would you like to hear it? why not? l think that some of your ferengi friends found a way to profit from lieutenant barclay's work. l think you were encouraged to get close to him, and when you had all the information you needed, you left him. l left reg for one simple reason. he's boring. don't tell me you never noticed. with the admiral's permission, l'd like a moment alone with leosa. l don't think therapy is what this woman needs, counselor. five minutes, admiral. five minutes. did you know l'm a betazoid? l'm empathic, which means l know when people are lying. tell me, what's the longest you've ever been incarcerated? you can't send me to prison, counselor. l didn't do anything wrong. maybe not, but l can order you held for psychiatric observation. extended observation. l may not be a betazoid but l work a dabo table, and l know when somebody's bluffing. try me. you were correct, admiral. the ferengi did steal reg's hologram-- twice. this is the ship you need to look for. that's it. that's nunk's ship. nunk? my... employer. scans indicate they've been in the vicinity of that star for the last 43 hours. why? l don't know. she's telling the truth... for once. the ferengi wouldn't have stolen the hologram if they didn't think it was valuable. they're probably waiting to rendezvous with a buyer. are there any starfleet ships in that area? the carolina is .7 light-years away. at maximum warp, it could reach them in two hours. open a channel. computer, open a secure channel to the carolina. tell captain peterson to adjust his course immediately. was everything that happened between us a lie? not everything. just the parts where l expressed affection for you. oh... if it makes any difference, it wasn't personal. lt was just... business. what exactly is a broken heart worth these days, hmm? ten percent. of what? profits from the nanoprobes. nanoprobes? mm-hmm. borg nanoprobes? yeah. gegis says they're worth two billion times their weight in latinum. oh. l don't think l quite understand the problem, doctor. are you aware that he's been doing impressions of you? you should hear his tuvok-- it's eerie. lt's disrespectful. what do you want me to do, deactivate him? just long enough to run a diagnostic of his program. his recent behavior may be indicative of a more serious problem. l haven't seen any evidence of that. of course not. ln front of you, he's all smiles... but l've seen him be rude and careless-- two traits the real lieutenant barclay never exhibited. l know the real barclay is a friend of yours, and l'm sorry if the holographic version hasn't lived up to your expectations, but that's hardly reason to deactivate him. are the lives of 150 crewmen reason enough? maybe you're right. maybe l am overreacting, but what if l'm right? we're less than a light-year away from the geodesic fold. do you want to risk being led through it by a malfunctioning hologram? captain, you saved us a com call. we're ready to bring the enhanced shielding on line. good work. l need a moment alone with reg. your program has been running continuously for how many hours now? 56 hours, 1 1 minutes and 21 seconds. l'd like to run a diagnostic of your matrix, make sure you haven't suffered any degradation over the last few days. this isn't the, uh... doctor's idea, is it? he expressed some concern for your well-being, yes. l bet he did. believe me, reg, the crew and l are grateful for everything you've done, but we need to take every precaution. l understand perfectly. and if the ship's doctor thinks l need a checkup, who am l to argue? why are you hiding in the corner? l'm not hiding. l'm working on a way to foil the ferengi's plans. reg, there's nothing left to foil. the carolina will have them in custody within the hour. leosa said the ferengi were going to be selling borg nanoprobes. what does that have to do with voyager?. they have a borg crewman. think about it. the ferengi stole the original barclay hologram a month ago. that gave them time to reprogram it and then smuggle it to voyager in the next transmission. reprogram it to do what? steal seven of nine's nanoprobes. for all we know, he could be dissecting her right now. what would the ferengi want with assimilation technology? oh, nanoprobes aren't just for assimilating. they can reanimate necrotic tissue, slow down the aging process. they'd be priceless for the ferengi. reg, even if the ferengi did reprogram your hologram to steal the nanoprobes, how would they get their hands on them? voyager's 30,000 light-years away. l haven't figured that part out yet. maybe they discovered a, a wormhole or a subspace corridor. have you mentioned any of this to commander harkins? not yet. l can't. lf l don't bring him hard evidence, he'll just think that l'm fantasizing. for the time being, we need to keep this between us. that tickles, lieutenant. sorry, reg, we're almost finished. have you identified any problems yet? l've gone over his entire matrix. he's working perfectly. maybe l'm not the one who needs a diagnostic, hmm? l'm a big enough hologram to admit when l'm wrong. l'm sorry l doubted you. well, if anyone is owed an apology, it's you. l should've been more sensitive. friends? friends. now that that's out of the way, captain, what do you say we get this ship back to earth? lt's time. lnitiate the geodesic pulse. would someone care to tell me what that is? lt's a geodesic fold, admiral. that's how they're going to get the nanoprobes. two million kilometers and closing, captain. take us to one-quarter impulse. bridge to astrometrics. bring the enhanced shielding on line. aye, commander. what's wrong? the fold contains three radiation types we didn't account for. the shield modifications are not enough. well, the shields were modified to work in combination with the inoculations. we'll be fine. lf the shields fail, the inoculations will be irrelevant. astrometrics to the bridge. go ahead. what is it, seven? there was a problem, captain, but l've corrected it. l'm using the mldas array to tap into the ferengi ship's sensors. they're receiving telemetry through the fold. lf l'm reading this correctly, voyager's headed right for it. captain janeway knows better than to take her ship into such a dangerous anomaly. lf the ferengi did alter my hologram, then... it might... might be possible for him to have taken over the ship. one hologram against an entire crew? he may have found a way to incapacitate the crew or to commandeer the ship's systems, but either way, we've got to get the carolina to close the fold. the carolina isn't equipped to do that. then they'll have to commandeer the ferengi ship and do it from there. the carolina's still half a light-year away. they won't make it in time. can we transmit a message, warn voyager?. not through a geodesic fold. our own starship, with multiphasic shielding and a gold-pressed latinum hull. we'll have enough left over to buy a fleet of casino ships! l have a better idea-- lobe enlargements! shh! ooh, someone's hailing us. who? l can't tell. there's too much interference. answer it. lt's the hologram. you said it was impossible to communicate through the fold. l thought it was. l guess l did a better job of reprogramming the hologram than l thought. we must close the geodesic fold immediately. captain janeway has found out about our plan. lf that's true, then why is she still headed for the fold? because she... found a way to protect her ship. lmpossible. you don't know janeway. she's uncanny when it comes to shields. she's furious. she said she was going to kill whoever tried to harm her crew. l strongly suggest you abort the mission. what should we do? go to warp before janeway makes it through. no, you mustn't! voyager has borg interquadrental warp drives and... hirogen hunting sensors and vidiian phase torpedoes. no matter where you run, voyager will find you. your only hope... is to close the fold. harkins to holodeck 1. go ahead, pete. lt worked, reg. they've started to close the fold. computer, end program. something's wrong, captain. astrometrics to the bridge. why are we stopping? the fold's collapsing, reg. we didn't make it in time. lt's not too late if we remodulate the shields. l appreciate your determination, but we can't risk it. you did everything you could. captain, someone just initiated a site-to-site transport. who? seven and reg. they've beamed to an escape pod. bridge to seven of nine. what's going on? the pod's been launched. put a tractor beam on it. there is too much interference from the fold. harry, can you get a transporter lock? what now? there's something coming through the fold. voyager?. no, it's too small. a phase torpedo! raise shields! brace for impact! lt's an escape pod. maybe the hologram sent us the drone. ooh...! check what's in there. nothing. no borg corpse, no nanoprobes. no profit. captain's log, supplemental. seven of nine has recovered from her injuries and ''reg'' has been deactivated. until we finish analyzing his program, his motivations remain a mystery. making first contact with a new life-form? ''mom's apple pie.'' neelix thought a little home cooking might cheer me up. and...? l haven't worked up the courage to taste it yet. have you figured out what went wrong with reg? well, seven thinks our proximity to the fold degraded his matrix, but if you ask me, it was a recursive error in his logic subroutine. not bad... but it would have tasted better in san francisco. lf it'll make you feel any better, l'll let you in on a little secret. l was on the bridge this morning when we received a hail from an lconian scientist. he claims to have a transdimensional gateway that can take us anywhere in the galaxy. l'm not that gullible. lt's true. l was there. the captain doesn't want us to get our hopes up, but personally, l think we'll be home by the end of the week. are you serious? you were right about him. computer, install barclay security protocol 21-alpha. lnstallation complete. ldentify yourself. c-computer, deactivate barclay program. l'm sorry. l... l've been programming him with new security precautions s-so he can't be stolen again. you seem to be off to a good start. l thought you'd, uh, be back at the beach. will and l decided to spend the rest of our vacation in tiburon. we were wondering if you're free for dinner tonight. uh, l, oh... oh, l, uh, l-l wouldn't want to be a ''third nacelle.'' not possible. will's bringing a friend for you. her name's maril. you're going to adore her. l'd like to, but l-l still have, uh... dozens of protocols to install. maybe next time. look, reg, l know leosa hurt you, but hiding inside a hologrid isn't the answer. you need to get out, meet new people. this maril wouldn't happen to be a dabo girl by any chance? she's a teacher, actually-- a real one. are you sure? don't worry, reg. we've taken security precautions."
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,"- good evening. this interesting object was found at the sight of an ancient hittite civilization. fortunately, it was very clearly labeled. it's a plowshare. it was made during the period when the hittites had signed a disarmament pact with their neighbors. i can see other uses for it. but of course, i'm rather imaginative and my mind sometimes moves in disturbing directions. you see, i have been challenged to a duel with my sponsor. and being allowed to choose the weapons, i selected this for him. for myself, i've chosen a hand grenade. i have dispensed with the second. however, my opponent has 60 of them during which he shall state his case. following that, we bring you tonight's play. it is the story of a modern day lady godiva and her peeping tom. (dramatic music) (phone rings) - hello? no, i can't. no, i'd love to, darling, but i can't. (suspenseful music) he's due back today. (laughs) what do you mean? that's the best excuse there is. no, i'm alone. trying to get a tan all over. fresh. no, you shouldn't say things like that. no, i am alone. stevie? oh, he's out with some kids for a swimming lesson or something. no, you can't come over. i told you. jack will be here soon. mm, four or five days maybe. (laughs) well, he didn't travel so much when i married him. oh, you're terrible. no, i haven't forgotten. i think you're forgetting something though. i'm married. all right. call me, uh, no. i'll call you. what? oh, that's nice. that's very nice. bye. (leaves rustling) who are you? what are you doing here? go on, go away from here! go away! snooping and staring at people like that. go away, i said! if you don't go away, i'll call my husband. - your husband's not here. i just heard you on the telephone. there's nobody here but you. don't be afraid of me. don't be frightened. i mean, all i'm doing is looking. - if you don't go this instant, i'll call the police. (dramatic music) hello, operator, get me the police quick. he must have come along the ditch down there. it runs in back of these houses. he scared me half to death, peering through at a person like that. i was lying in the sun. i had a swimsuit on. - yes ma'am. - he wouldn't go. i asked him to go and he wouldn't until i ran in the house to call you and then he disappeared. - did he actually come onto your property, ma'am? - well, no. - or threaten you or anything? - not with words but it was the way he looked at me and the way he told me he knew i was alone and that my husband wasn't home. i was talking on the phone. i guess he heard me. - talking to your husband? - no, a friend. my husband's in chicago on business. he'll be home tonight. what's that got to do with it? - how old would you say that this boy was, ma'am? - 19, 20 maybe. he was six feet. wearing light blue jeans and a t-shirt. - have you ever seen him before? - no, never. - you'd know him again, though? - oh, sure i would. standing there just staring. i was holding towel in front of me but he just looked me. i felt like i wasn't wearing anything. look, you've got to find this boy and tell him to stay away from here. - well, maybe he didn't mean any harm, ma'am. he just looked over your fence, didn't try to come on the property, and didn't actually threaten you in any way. - he scared me. isn't that enough? look, i'm alone here most of the time, except for my stepson. - how old's he? - 12. - is he here now? - no, he's at a swimming lesson or something. please find this boy and tell him to stay away from here. - well, we can see if he's a neighborhood boy, ma'am. maybe you'd like to go along with us while we make a few inquiries and you can identify him if we find him. - well, if you'll wait, i'll change into something. - pardon me, ma'am. - huh? - just like to ask a question. - oh, they know me down at the market. they let me take the basket home. i always return it. - sure ma'am, that's okay. we're looking for a young man might live around here. over six feet, big, dark hair, wearing light blue jeans and a t-shirt, about 19 or 20 years old. - oh. oh, sure, wait a minute. there is a boy like that with the master's family. the new people, on maple avenue. a house at the far end. white house, needs painting. why? what's he done? - nothing, ma'am. thanks. (gentle music) - yes? what's the matter? what do you want? - does a young man live here? dark hair, over six feet, 19 or 20 years old? - that was him! - [aunt] what's the trouble? - is that your son, ma'am? - no, it's my nephew, roy, roy bullock. why, what's he done? - i want a word with him. - what for? roy's a good boy. he never gives any trouble. he doesn't party and tear around like some. - that's all right, ma'am. i just want to talk to him for a minute. - well, we just moved in here last week and we're not straightened yet. - sure, ma'am, that's all right. - police coming here for everybody to see. - you want something? - yeah, ask you a few questions. - well, you better come inside. - this is your room? - uh-huh. what's the matter? - improving your mind, huh? - is there some kind of law that says what you got to read? - there's a law against bothering people and making yourself a nuisance. - what, you mean the lady outside in your car? - yeah, she turned a complaint against you. - what, for looking over her fence? officer, i was standing on city property. i wasn't on her property. she was sunbathing and i was looking at her, that's all. - why? - well now, wait a minute. there's no law against looking. i mean, she was sunbathing and i was looking at her. i mean, she got mad and went in the house and that's all that happened, believe me. - well that's not the way she tells it. my advice to you, son, is to cut out this peeping tom act with her or anybody else. for your own good. okay? - okay. but it wasn't a peeping tom act. but i will bare in mind what you said. i wish you'd tell her that for me, too. is that all? - yeah. that's all, i hope. for your own sake. (dramatic music) thank you, ma'am. it was him. but i warned him and he won't bother you again. (peaceful music) (doorbell buzzes) - hi, jack. - hello, lucy. - i saw your taxi drive up. i brought these cookies over for stevie. i just made them. - where is marsha and stevie? do you know? marsha knew what plane i was coming in on. i thought she was going to meet me. - i don't know where stevie is but marsha went off in a police car. - police car? - yes, she told me all about it while she was waiting for them to come. - about what? - oh, about this peeping tom peering through her at the fence while she was sunbathing with no clothes on. - with no clothes on? - well, almost. - come on, lucy, what happened? - actually, nothing happened. this boy sneaked up to stare at her and marsha got panicky and called the police. of course, it's not for me to say, but marsha does kind of like to make everything dramatic. and after all, if a person lies around almost naked-- - what marsha does is her business. - marsha confides in me and i try to give her good advice. advice you should be grateful for. - what do you mean? - nevermind. i try to be a good neighbor and-- - okay. okay, i'm sorry, lucy. thanks for the cookies. i'd better call the police and see what this is all about. - i'll give you some advice too, jack. you oughtn't to leave marsha alone so much. shshe's told me.s. not that i think there's anything wrong with her going out when you're away. i'm sure marsha isn't the type to do anything stupid. - what do you mean by that? - nothing. i guess marsha can look after herself. but she's an attractive woman and she doesn't mind letting the whole world see that she thinks so. and a woman alone in this town. you know what men are. it's small wonder peeping toms come around. - that's about enough, lucy. i think you've made your-- - dad! hi, mrs phillips, hi dad! - hello stevie. - hello stevie. how have you been, stevie? - fine. - i thought you were gonna be at the airport. - well, i didn't know you were coming today. hey, what's the matter with mrs phillips? i don't like her. she's always asking questions. - now didn't marsha... didn't your mother tell you i was coming home today? - uh-uh. hey, cookies! gee, i'm hungry. - you act like you're starving. - well, i didn't have any lunch. - [jack] why not? - well, mom was busy. - yeah. too busy even to tell you i was coming home today. - [stevie] what'd you say? - nothing. come on. you can bring the cookies. i brought you a present. - oh! gee, that's neat! - how's that, huh? - gee, it's great, dad! thanks a lot. - you can fly it in the park. - hey, can we go there now? - oh i'm sorry, stevie. not right now. why don't you take it up to your room, study the instructions? - okay dad. hey, i seen jimmy fly his and i think i know how it works.

(gentle music) - i'll walk him home, mr. fowler. - as the gentlemen said who was in the process of administering the coup de grace, ""we are halfway through."" in television, we hesitate at this point in order to savor the moment and indulge in a station break. granted, the victim suffers a bit, but rules are rules. we shall continue after the following. (dramatic music) - don't keep on about it. i promised ken i'd be there early tonight, period. - [marsha] you told me you were playing poker there tomorrow evening. - we changed it. - and where does that leave me? - here. right here without getting anybody in to stay with stevie while you go out. - what do you mean by that crack? - you know what i mean. i mean like when i'm away. - so sometimes i go out to lucy's next door or to a movie. what am i supposed to be? a prisoner or something? - you're supposed to be my wife, a mother to stevie. - stevie. - hi dad, hi mom. - stevie. - what are you doing here? - so long, stevie. you left your oil can over at my house. so i'll bring it over to you some night, okay? we stopped by my house for a little while, mr. fowler. night. - goodnight. - goodnight roy. - night mrs. fowler.

(suspenseful music) - no, don't, don't! keep away from me! for pity's sake, don't! i'll talk. i'll tell you anything you wanna know. only don't! (banging on window) - mr. fowler. i was watching the late show on tv. what's the matter? - i wanna speak with you, young man. - well, sure. come on in. right there. my aunt and uncle are asleep though. so, shh. now what's this all about, mr. fowler? - look, you can cut out the innocent bit. you telephone my home again and scared my wife. - [roy] i did not. now, why would i do a thing like that? - why? why'd you snoop through the fence at her? - mr. fowler, i already explained that to you. i never did snoop through the fence at her. i've been out on a date tonight with nancy willis, my girlfriend. remember her? the girl on the porch that danced and twisted, the crazy kid? she's a cook. well i just got home. - maybe you're a cook too. the nasty voice on the phone type. calling people up to scare them, shock them. my wife swears it was you. - why would she do that, mr. fowler? what does she got against me? huh? look, mr. fowler, i have heard about guys calling up women on the phone and saying things to them on the phone. guys on some kind of a kick. you really think i would do something like that? now, i mean, why? because i got these magazines in my room? does that make me a cook? (chuckles) mr. fowler, now let's face it you mean to tell me that when you were my age you didn't have any of these kind of magazines in your room, huh? (laughs) - my wife swears it was you that phoned. okay, so you've been out. there's a telephone booth at the end of our street. and whoever called said ""you just turned out the light"" or ""you're lying there in the dark"" or something like that. so it must've been within sight of the house. and he hung up the phone when my car turned in the driveway. now you've had time to get home here before i got here. - now mr. fowler, you're getting me all wrong and you are starting to get me sore. - get you sore? - that's right, get me sore. and if your wife's gonna sling accusations around, maybe there's a few accusations i could make about her. - why, you punk! what do you mean? - [roy] nothing! so forget it. i mean, your wife sends you around here late at night saying all sorts of crazy things about me. what does it matter with her? - now you look here. - i am looking. i am looking. mr. fowler, look. i have no quarrel with you. believe me, i don't. i'm not interested in any woman who's older than me. it's late, she sent you here, you said what you have to say, and i've said what i wanted to say. now please, let me go to sleep, okay? look. i don't claim to know a whole lot about women, you know? but maybe all your wife wants is some attention drawn to her. your attention. - okay. i don't know, maybe you're right. but if it was you that phoned. okay. well, goodnight. - don't slam the door on your way out. my folks are still sleeping. - yeah. goodnight. (gentle music) (roy whistling) (phone ringing) - hello? - [mysterious man] waiting for my call, huh? - jack. jack, come here. - [mysterious man] who are you kidding? he's not there. you're all alone. i know. - go away. stop this. stop it! - [mysterious man] what are you wearing? tell me what you're wearing. what kind of nightgown? you're very exciting. - stop it. stop it. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - come on, give it to me. - comes behind him. fakes around, he's up! and he scores! - ra, ra, ra! i'm going down to the drugstore. you wanna come down and buy me a soda, huh? - no, i'm gonna watch the kid. - what are you, some kind of camp counselor suddenly or something? - yes, that's right, dear. suddenly i'm a camp counselor. that's exactly what i am. i'll see you around. - yeah, like a... i don't need you, brother. - no, but you sure need a little bit of new dialogue. let's go, it's your shot. - didn't you wanna go with her? i don't mind. - come on, shoot it up. come on. - gee, look it, roy. - yeah. - how 'bout that? - very good. come on, i'll buy you a soda. - oh boy! you bet! - why sure, mr. wilson. sure, i can. no. i didn't think they'd accept the estimate this early. that's right, mr. wilson. sure. no, no i can drive up there. i'll check with you after i've seen him. okay, bye mr. wilson. you bet. how 'bout that? - what's wrong? - well, i just get back from chicago and they want me to go to san francisco. - oh yeah? - look, why don't we do this? we'll all three drive up there, you and stevie and me, and i'll take care of my business. we'll have some fun for a few days and drive back. - jack, you know i hate driving all day. - oh, come on, honey. the trip will do you good. - sitting in a car getting all creased? - oh, come on, marsha. - look, why don't you fly up? then you can make your deal and come back in the same day. it only takes an hour or something. tell you what. you say you wanna give stevie a treat. you know, he's crazy about planes. why don't you take him with you? - you sound like you wanna get rid of us. - for a whole day, yes. then i can take up the hem on the new dress you bought me. - take stevie, huh? yeah. yeah, why not? he'd get a real kick out of it. why not? (peaceful music) - oh hi, dad. - oh hi there. - hi mr. fowler. - hello roy. - we were practicing our basketball and roy bought me this. - yeah? well i've got a surprise for you. we're going to san francisco tomorrow, just you and me, by plane for the whole day. how do you like that? we'll leave early in the morning, get back late at night. - in a plane, honest? oh boy, in a plane! oh dad! - take it easy. you go in and wash up. about time for lunch. - okay. so long, roy. - take your ball with you. well, he sure is a good kid, mr. fowler. - he thinks the world of you, roy. you take a lot of trouble with him. - well, it's really nothing. i guess when i was his age, i was pretty shy of people too. just the two of you going up to san francisco tomorrow or? - yeah. well, i'll see you. - take care. have a good trip. (roy whistles) (playful music) (roy whistling) (suspenseful music) (phone rings) - hello? - [mysterious man] you've been out, haven't you? your husband's not there. you're all alone, aren't you? you don't want to be alone, do you? you never want to be alone. - lucy. (phone rings) lucy, please answer. lucy. (suspenseful music) (knocking on door) you. what do you want? - i just wanna talk to you, mrs. fowler, while you're still alone. i waited all day. - get out of here. my husband will be home in a few minutes. - he won't be home for quite a while. - breaking into a person's house. i'll tell my husband. i'll tell the police! - no, no, mrs. fowler. i didn't break in. you let me in. and i brought a present for stevie. i wouldn't break in to do that, would i? i've had this since i was a kid about stevie's age, myself. he saw it at my house the other night. i thought he'd like to have it. - get out of here. - not until i've told you something, mrs. fowler. you are doing to stevie exactly what my stepmother did to me and that's what killed my father. the way that she went on all the time, all the time she went on. sure it was an accident. that's what the papers said, an accident. it's an accident that a man drives over a cliff on a clear blue day? - what's that got to do with me? you're crazy! - a string of men friends all the time, mrs. fowler. a string of men friends all the time. shh, don't tell anybody, roy. this is your uncle joe from kokomo, roy. why don't you go outside in the yard for a little bit, roy, huh? why don't you go away to camp for one week, roy? - stop it! - that's the way you talk to stevie, isn't it? yeah, i know. he's told me, mrs. fowler. look, mrs. fowler, don't you understand kids don't like to be gotten rid of? they want a home that's a home to them. that's all. - if you don't stop this-- - listen to me and let me finish. you are just exactly like she was. vain and selfish and conceited. you wanna have your cake and eat it too, don't you? you know, your husband's an all right guy but that's not enough for you, is it? oh no. you've got to have a bunch of people admiring you all the time. men looking at you all the time. well, he's gonna find out about you and stevie will find out about you. just exactly what you are. the same way i found out. - i suppose you'll whisper it to them on the phone. - telling them won't help them, mrs. fowler. i'm telling you. there's a smell of death about women like you. death and corruption. you corrupt people the way you go on all the time. so you better cut it out, you understand that? - [marsha] now will you get out? - now just put the gun down, mrs. fowler. my rotten stepmother killed my father and me without any gun. put the gun down. how many people do you want to kill, mrs. fowler? - get away from me. you're out of your mind. - you sure are out of your mind, mrs. fowler. trying to mess up a nice guy and an innocent kid. - nobody'd blamed me if i shot you now with your filthy phone calls, breaking in here like this. how exciting am i now with a gun pointing at you? - you're very exciting, mrs. fowler, just like she was. and you're rotten just like she was. i think it's time that your husband found out about you. (gun bangs) (dramatic music) - oh, no. i didn't mean to kill you. (phone ringing) - [mysterious man] what are you doing? i bet you'd like to have me come over there. (marsha gasps) you're exciting. - that concludes our story. at least it concludes mr. roy bullock. it was not the end of mrs. fowler, however. the jury recommended mercy. as for the anonymous caller, he was permitted one more call to his attorney. you see, a policeman happened to be waiting to use the payphone at the time of that last call. i have traded my sword for a much more practical instrument. i feel much better. this is more my style. now it is time to hear from my worthy opponent. he seems to have forgotten about our duel. so i imagine i can relax now.

0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"previously on babylon 5: i read four centauri warships. too many to fight. this is leftover shadow technology, mr. president. it's an organic device used to control a ship from a long distance. you put two or three of these onboard a starship and you don't even need a crew. that's why we couldn't figure out a strategy behind the random attacks. we couldn't see a goal because there was no goal. there was no strategy beyond alienating everyone in the alliance... ...turn them against the centauri so that... so they'd attack! - what did they ask you to do? - to send away all the ships... ...guarding centauri prime... ...on a false emergency... ...and turn off the planetary defense network. dear g'quan... g'kar... stay here. i will call for a doctor, then i have to find the regent. you will be all right. i thought you should know... ... narn and drazi fleets have begun assaulting the centauri homeworld. - what about the planetary defense net? - they're apparently down. the ships that normally guard centauri prime have moved. somebody's left the door open and our people are moving through it. there's one other thing you need to know. we just got word. john, delenn's white star's been missing for at least 12 hours. they think she might have run into a wing of centauri warships. regent. they say the bombardment is moving away from the capital... ...into the outer areas. - we should be safe for a time. - madness. our people are dying by the thousands, tens of thousands. yes. - they say... - who says? - who are they? what are you talking about? - they... ...say... ...it's your time now, londo. and so it begins. - there is a hole in your mind. - what do you want? no one here is exactly what he appears. nothing's the same anymore. commander sinclair is being reassigned. why don't you eliminate the entire narn homeworld? i see a great hand reaching out of a star. president clark signed a decree declaring martial law. these orders have forced us to declare independence. unless your people get off their encounter-suited butts and do something... - you're the one who was. - if you go to z'ha'dum, you will die. why are you here? do you have anything worth living for? i think of my beautiful city in flames. - giants in the playground. - get out of our galaxy! we are here to place president clark under arrest. who...? what are you? they are called drakh. drakh? i know you. you worked for the shadows. they say... ...the shadows were our masters. we served them... ...believed in them, loved them. then they went away and left us behind... ... to escape on our own. but without our masters... ...who are we? in the end... ...what are we but...? - a shadow... ...of a shadow. an echo of what was. our home, z'ha'dum, destroyed. we wandered. then we remembered... ...this place. we remembered... ...you. their masters saw great potential here. they came in considerable numbers... ...with their ships and their associate... ...mr. morden. you remember. yes. you don't frighten me, mollari. if you try to attack our forces, you'll lose. yes, your ships are very impressive in the air or in space. but at this moment they are on the ground. fine. they're on the ground. but they can sense an approaching ship miles away. so what are you going to do, mollari? blow up the island? actually... ...now that you mention it... no! i remember. you just made a mistake, londo! even if my associates lose this war, they have allies! they'll make sure centauri prime pays the price... ... for what you've done here today! allies? that would be you. then it wasn't you who started this war. it was them, wasn't it? you want your revenge, but you don't want anyone to know you are here. and so you used our forces to attack everyone in the alliance. turn them against us... ...and make them do your work. yes. but what good is it to take your revenge against innocent people? your quarrel is with me. if you want vengeance, i'm standing right here. take it. they say... ...they do not want your life, mollari. at least not yet. then what do you want? a home. our new home. you are now... ...what we need you to be... ...a beaten... ...resentful people who will have to rebuild... ...who will have to rely on our... ...good graces... ...who can be used and... ...guided as we wish to guide you. perfect ground for us to do our work... ...quietly. quietly. - no. i will not allow it! - yes, you will. as i did. you see, londo, they learn quickly. they learned from the shadows, and they learned from you. they've planted fusion bombs throughout centauri prime. unless they get what they want, millions of our people will die... ...and the blame will go to the alliance. in all this bombing, who will notice a few more craters? no, wait. don't. what do you want of me? what we want from you... ...is you. this is president sheridan to narn and drazi fleets. you are ordered to cease fire at once. cease fire, or we will target your ships and destroy them. of course. we'd be happy to oblige in exchange for your support. after all, you promised to back any act we judged appropriate. i never sanctioned an attack on centauri prime, and you know it! i gave you strict instructions! of course you did, hence our decision to end the war for you. and now that we have taken the first steps... ... you can join us in the battle with clean hands. negative. won't happen. well, then we have a slight problem, mr. president. you see, the ships that normally guard centauri prime were called away. they will return in two or three hours. when they arrive... ...they will not be interested in explanations as to what was or was not authorized. they will be out for blood... ... and revenge. you can either fight beside us and live... ... or hold back and die. what will it be, mr. president? our ships will be returning soon, londo. when that happens, they will attack sheridan's fleet... ...with every weapon they have. and centauri prime will pay the price in more dead. we have no interest in fighting the alliance. - issue the surrender order. - i can't. you see, i'm your alibi. you will say that i was quite mad... ...and that i gave the attack orders without the knowledge of yourself... ...or anyone else in the government. then you can give the order to surrender. i don't have the authority. you will... ...because i will be dead and you will be emperor. it's all very clean that way. once i'm gone, you can blame me for anything you want. i won't mind. really. because i'll know... ...you had no choice. no choice at all. what do you mean, no choice? look at me, londo. look closely. you can't see it until it chooses to be seen. great maker. - what is it? - it's called a keeper. they become a part of you. they can control you... ...but only when their interests are at stake. you will be free to do as you wish the rest of the time. i live... ...only as long as it is part of me. i have to go now, londo. no. don't go. i have been many things in my life, mollari. i have been silly. i have been quiet when i should have spoken. i have been foolish. and i have wasted far too much time. but i am still centauri. and i am not afraid. distance to centauri fleet? centauri warships will be within optimum firing range in 20 standard minutes. do we prepare to engage? mr. president? negative. negative. we will not engage. get me centauri prime. there must be someone there that i can talk to. - they're not responding. - well, keep sending. and try delenn's ship again. divert all white stars in that area to search for her. i want that ship found. do you know how much time we have left on life support? it's hard to say. meaning you do not know or you do not wish to say? meaning... ...perhaps it is better not to know. it is, however, a moot point. our navigational thrusters will be out of fuel soon. once we're off the beacon, we'll be caught in the hyperspace currents. i'm sorry, delenn. there's nothing you could have done, lennier. nothing at all. no, no, no, no. sit. sit. i can't stay. i just wanted to see how you were. better. i would be dead if not for you. you risked your life to save mine. yes. you would have done the same. yes, but i am a better person. you ingrate. i promised i would get you out of that cell, yes? do i not keep my promises? where you go, i go. yes. that must now... ...change, however. i cannot have you following me around as my bodyguard any longer. i do not think it would be appropriate or safe. - why not? l... - the regent is dead, g'kar. in a few moments, i will take his place. they are... ...preparing for me now. and although i cannot formally become emperor... ...until tomorrow when the centaurum meets... ...unofficially... ...i am now in charge. after tonight... ...i don't know that i will ever see you again... ...and... ...i wanted to... ...say goodbye. i don't know why that should be important to me now at a time like this, but it is. in the months and the years to come... ...you may hear many strange things about me, my behavior. well... ...they say the position... ...changes you. and i just... - i wanted to... - i understand. perhaps. and perhaps you do not understand as much as you think. pray... ...that you never do, g'kar. pray... ...that you never truly understand. well, i must hurry. our ships will soon be in firing range. isn't it strange, g'kar? when we first met... ...i had no power... ...and all the choices i could ever want. and now i have all the power i could ever want... ...and no choices at all. no choice at all. mollari. understand... ...that i can never forgive your people... ...for what they did to my world. my people... ...can never forgive your people. but i... ...can forgive... ...you. i'm ready. no reply from delenn's white star, mr. president. should we abandon our position and join the search? mr. president? no. how far until the centauri hit optimum firing range? five minutes. picking up a transmission from centauri prime to the approaching fleet ships. - what are they saying? - it's encrypted. could be an attack order, could be anything. come on, talk to me. i'm getting the sound of angry voices, an argument of some kind. it stopped. - the position of centauri fleet? - they're... ...holding position... ...not advancing any further. picking up another signal from centauri prime. it's for you. put it through. mr. president. i don't know if you're monitoring our transmissions, but... i have. i accept you at your word that this terrible assault on our world... ... was not sanctioned by you... ... because we find ourselves in a much similar situation. the attack on the alliance shipping lanes, which precipitated this war... ... were not authorized by the centaurum. they were done under the express orders of the regent. he acted alone. - and where is the regent? - dead. i would say... ... that his hearts gave out. i am in charge here now. - then you will give the recall order? - our ships have been told to ignore... ...any message which does not come in at exactly specified times. as they check in, we will give the recall order. there is no longer any reason for us to fight. then this is over. i don't think our military will be very happy about it, but yes. this is now over. then i would like to come down and talk to you directly. - there's something that i need you to do. - that might not be wise. our people may not take kindly to your presence. i'll take that chance. it's about delenn. her ship is missing in action. very well. i will make sure you are met at the space port... ... and brought here as soon as you land. thank you. what happened to delenn? no. no. i ask you, i beg of you not to do this. there is nothing to be gained in killing her. and the last position we have on delenn's ship puts her about two jumps from minbar. the grey council has half their fleet looking for her... ...but you know what hyperspace is like. it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack in the middle of a tornado. now we need to know the exact location the attack on her ship took place. well, that may be difficult. as i said, we cannot contact our ships except at predetermined times. i understand. all i'm asking is that you do whatever you can. of course. though, if i do this for you, i may someday come to you and ask for a favor in return. londo, she's your friend too. our world has been savagely attacked by your people, and you call us friends? - yes. we can still help each other. - absolutely not! the centauri republic will have nothing more to do with this alliance of yours. we will raise ourselves back to what we once were without your help. if i give you back delenn's life, it will be an act of charity, nothing more. do you understand me? yes. i will, however, remind you that as the losing party in this war... ...you will make reparations to the alliance worlds that your ships attacked. we may be able to mitigate that slightly. - oh? - we believe that most of your ships... ...engaged in hostile actions... ...were under the control of some kind of leftover shadow technology. we found some semi-organic pods that control the ships long distance. yes, i am aware of them. the regent bought them on the black market as insurance against mutiny. old news. - but why didn't you...? - if you want us to find delenn for you... ...i suggest you allow us to do it... ...before one of our other ships finds her and finishes what the first one started. that's the last of the navigational thrusters. starting now, we'll drift further off the beacon. perhaps it's not so bad to go off the beacon. no one knows what's out there. maybe we'll find a million-year-old jumpgate left behind by the first ones. that would be amazing... ...wouldn't it, lennier? yes. i would, of course, expect you to get it working in a timely fashion. - i will do my best. - good. minbar should have reported our disappearance by now. i don't understand why they're not looking for us. i'm sure they are. but nothing works the way it should out here. we are far away... ...and far between. there is one other thing we could do, delenn. our weapons system is still barely functional. if there are any ships in the area looking for us... ...firing the weapons could attract them. it could also attract the centauri warships that attacked. either way, the recoil from the discharge would push us further off the beacon. i see. which control? green, then red twice. green... ...then red. - twice. that would appear to be all we had left. yes. so it would seem. what...? it's a proximity alert. something's coming. we seem to have attracted the wrong kind of attention. that's the power monitor. it tracks their weapon system. when the beeping becomes a steady tone... ...they'll have reached critical and can fire their weapons. coded transmission. they're probably confirming the kill shot with centauri prime. delenn. yes? i love you. i know. lennier... ...you said something a moment ago. i didn't actually hear it. the power monitor, you see, it was making a great deal of noise. nothing. i said nothing. well... ...at times of great stress, one can say things one did not intend to say... ...would never have said under other circumstances. i don't think anyone should be held to that or asked to explain or... well, it's neither here nor there, as the humans say. lennier, look at me. nothing happened. except that for a moment... ...i found myself feeling extremely complimented... ...and deeply honored... ...by your presence... ...and by your friendship. so... ...when they bring us back to centauri prime... ...do you think we'll have to fight our way out of this? for their sake, i hope not. excuse me. excuse me. i'm... could you tell me, have you seen the prime minister? londo? have you seen the prime minister? - londo! - what is wrong with you? - but l... - never burst in on me without knocking! do you understand? never do this again! - but i've always... - do you understand? yes. - yes, i understand. - good. now, what are you doing here? what are you talking about? i came as soon as i heard. i wanted to see if you were all right. i'm... ...fine, vir. just fine. i thought you'd be in the royal suite by now. no. not until after the inauguration. and i am in no rush. have you seen the damage? we still don't have a count on all the dead and wounded. how am i supposed to live in the royal suite and look out at all of that? you could always board up the windows. i suppose they told you the terms of our surrender? yes, they did. but if we pay the damages that they want, there won't be enough money to rebuild. i know, but we have no choice, vir. no choice at all. it's what must be. the people won't stand for it. they're tired, resentful and angry. angry at what has happened... ...angry at the alliance, at you, at everyone. they were right. they got what they wanted. who? nothing. no one. you will calm them down, of course, help them see what needs to be done... ...and make them understand. yes, i will talk with them. are the others here? i passed them in the hallway. i almost knocked g'kar over. then we should get this over with. - are you sure you're all right? - i'm fine. just tired, that's all. with all that's happened, i don't feel i could miss londo's inauguration. it may be our one chance to get the new administration off to a good start. citizens of centauri prime. - where is...? - outside. i'd heard he was going to address the people. we have come through the long night... ... of fire, pain and death. we have been gravely wounded... ... but we remain centauri. the regent began the war with the alliance, and that war is now over. the greater one... ... the war to rebuild our world... ... and restore our place in the galaxy now begins. sheridan and his alliance have struck deeply at our people... ... exacting a terrible price in the lives of those who died during the night. another great price must now be paid... ... in the form of reparations... ... which will come close to ruining our economy. they wish to teach us a lesson... ... to break us... ... so that we will never again be a problem. this punishment is unfair... ...is a violation of our sovereign rights. but we will bear this burden... ...as we have borne so many before. we are no longer a part of the alliance. we are alone. we fought alone, and we will rebuild alone. we will work even harder to show those who have come to humiliate us... ...that we will not bow down. as a symbol of our new isolationism... ... i will walk alone to my inauguration. i will take on the burden of emperor in silence. the bells of our temples will sound all day and all night. once for each of our people killed in the bombings. we are alone... ... alone in the universe. but we are united in our pain. may the great maker be with you all. did you hear? yes. i thought he was going to calm people down, not turn them against us. i don't understand it myself, but i'm sure he has a very good reason for it. my reasons are my own. in light of what you have just seen, i do not think it would be prudent... ...for you to be at the inauguration, any of you. i cannot guarantee your safety if you insist on coming. that's all right. it's been a difficult time for all of us. if you would rather this was a closed ceremony... i would. vir, you will go with them. - but l... - delenn, mr. president... ...as my first official act, i am formally appointing vir cotto... ...as ambassador to babylon 5. i have every confidence that he will do... ...at least as good a job as i did. londo, are you sure? vir, i have never been surer of anything in my life. go now, quickly. you should not be here. none of you should be here. go on. we will talk again when things calm down. all right. check in with you when we get back to babylon 5... ...and see how things are going. if we can help... thank you. lennier wanted me to thank you on his behalf and mine for saving us. i find... ...i can no longer see the road you're on, londo. there's a darkness around you. i can only pray that in time you may find your way out of it. vir, tell them... tell them that i am ready. so this is the shadow technology they used to control the centauri warships. yes. it's not as efficient as some of their other techniques. like using humans as living control systems for their main ships. exactly. isn't there a way we can follow up on this? no. londo says the regent bought this stuff on the black market. maybe that's true, maybe it isn't. either way, it dead-ends our investigation. well, i know one thing. this little device scares me more than anything i've ever seen. not for what it is, but what it represents. you ever been out to see the san diego ruins? well, i have. the thermonuclear device used by the terrorists to blow up san diego... ...could be traced right back to the breakup of the soviet union in the late 20th century. when they fell, all of their weapons ended up with smaller governments... ...who didn't understand them, sure as hell couldn't build them... ...but were eminently willing to use them. the great thing about war is that it advances technology. bad thing about war is that most of the technologies are destructive. and once the war is over, those weapons are still around. weapons like us. yes. weapons like telepaths. and that thing there and anything else that may have gotten out. now, we know that the shadows had hundreds of allies working for them. and we know that most of them, or all of them, got out before z'ha'dum exploded. now, who knows what they took with them... ...and how much of it is in the hands of people who don't understand it... ...couldn't build it, but are willing to use it. the giants have left the playground. but they left their guns behind. all right, what about the vorlon homeworld? maybe they left something behind we can use to our own advantage. over a dozen ships have been sent there by various governments since the vorlons left. they were all destroyed by the automatic defense systems before they even got close. the vorlon homeworld is off-limits until we're ready... ...until we've earned the right to go there... ...a million years from now. don't ask. i don't know where that came from any more than you do. i just know it. excuse me. the captain thought you should know that the fighting on the station has stopped. the centauri surrender took most of the wind out of things. good. so why the long faces? things are quiet, the attacks have stopped and we won the war. - what's the problem? - yes, we won the war... ...but what did we lose?

""this exceptional bargain traveled only 250 miles, ""before falling into the water of cape canaveral."" or perhaps you'd be interested in a late-model thor which still has the original mouse in its nose cone. but now, for our movie. it is a one-minute condensation of a 1935 hit. how was the party, john? it was expensive. that's how it was. it's a good thing we only have an anniversary once a year. don't know what there is to celebrate, anyway. it don't pay to get excited, john. who's excited? my wife acted perfectly normal. you could hear her purr through the whole performance like a rattlesnake in a small paper bag. get me some water, dad. and when the party's over out at the country club, i walk out into the lobby, just as nice as you please, and i say to the manager, ""send me the bill."" just as simple as that. but not for dorothy. ""why don't you pay the man now?"" she says. ""what are we, a couple of paupers, john?"" right in front of everybody. i could have killed her right there. i could have stuffed her big mouth with that $60 hat of hers. that's $1000 i could have turned over on this lot two or three times before i even got the bill! i'll go get some hamburgers, john. what do i want with hamburgers? i just had lamb chops for $482. a nice cup of coffee, john? you always feel better with a nice cup of coffee. yeah, i guess so. hey, look at this one here. no, no, no. nice paint job, huh? yeah, but what's that got to do with what we want it for? what's wrong with it? it's empty. it's too new. that's nice. okay, how about this one here? look, it's too much money. you're a drag. hey, this is real nice. it's wonderful, it's beautiful! but what're you gonna pay for it with? okay, all right. come here, look at this one, this is nice. low down payment, the works. can i help you fellows? oh, you're mr. forbes? my name is lester, i'm from the city college. this here's my friend, harry. - hi. - harry. hey, we're throwing kind of a bazaar, i mean a carnival. and you want me to take a chance on an automobile. look, i've got 182 cars on the lot now. no, we were looking for an old jalopy, one you could hit with a sledgehammer. for what? like, you know, three shots for a quarter, man. you know, whammo! you know, guys like to show how strong they are. that's just another human failing, sir. the... the occasional need to destroy. our psychology prof suggested it for our carnival. he said the quarters would be bound to roll in. how much you got to spend? we got $50. half a yard. that's about enough to buy four used tires, if there's any rubber left on them at all, never mind the car to go with it. but, sir, this is a very important project to us. we're gonna give a small donation to our library fund. you see, that makes it cultural. yeah, very uplifting. you'll be a patron of the arts! well, come back friday, i'll see if i can't find some load for you to use. oh, hey, you're all right, mr. forbes. hey, see you around like a donut, huh? come on! all right. nice kids, but lunatics. they want some load they can pound into junk with a sledgehammer. that's just one of those things. enough sugar in here? if i tell them to take their lousy 50 bucks and go buy a pair of roller skates, then i lose the college trade. so, what're you gonna do? if i'm not here friday when they come back, give them that green '48 coupe, the one with the transmission gone. i couldn't unload that for more than 80 bucks, anyway. i'd be just as well off if i wholesaled everything in this lot, and got out of this business once and for all. what's in it for me? oh, don't worry, dad, i wouldn't be dumping you. my wife costs me more in that beauty parlor every week, than you get in your whole pay envelope. it ain't easy at my age, john. nobody wants to take you on when you're this old. not that i can't be useful. not that i don't move around like i was only half my age. i know, i heard you. i'll take care of you. just forget what i said, dad. you got nothing to worry about. oh, dad, your wife is here with your lunch. hello, mr. forbes. now, what does a nice old gal like that have to wait outside for? kitty? yeah. why don't you ever ask her in? kitty don't like to come in the office during business hours, john. ""don't mix business with pleasure,"" kitty and i always say. pleasure, after 47 years? kitty ain't so bright these days. getting old, you know. but her and i get along pretty good. excuse me, john you're looking for john, mrs. forbes? - yes. - he's in the office. do you always call him john? yes, ma'am. excuse me. a trip to new zealand to see your cousin nan. the day after our anniversary party, i have to get hit with that! there's no use in raising your voice, john. i've already called the travel agency, and i'm determined to get away. then you just get down off that high-octane horse and call the agency back. tell them your husband can't afford a trip to new zealand. and keep your big mouth shut about this to your fine friends in the country club. i'm telling you, dorothy, the answer is no. if you advertise it that you're going and then you don't, they'll think i've got money problems. i can't afford that now when business is slow. first thing you know, the bank'll tighten up on me. thanks for the suggestion. what suggestion? the value of publicity, darling. i'll let you figure that one out. new zealand! i'll get her a one-way ticket right out of cape canaveral. zoom! scare the pants right off the man in the moon! did you ever hear of a woman like that? with me in hock and things so slow on the lot? i've gotta cut expenses. who am i working for, anyway? the country club? the department stores? the steamship lines? i'd be better off collecting a salary from some other poor slob. forbes motor sales. you got a what? a '53 coupe, nice and clean? well, that's exactly what you told me about that mobile hen coop you tried to unload on me last week. all right, we'll be over, murph. but i'll tell you right now, i wouldn't give you more than five bills for a '53 if you loaded it with blondes. okay. that was eddie murphy. they took a '53 coupe on a trade. go over and pick it up. i gotta get back to the house before the empress takes off for the country club and starts to blab about new zealand. that's all i need. oh, if that car's any good, bring it on out to the house. take the car over to the garage and have them check the universal joint. i could hear it clanking all the way over. you need gas, john. i've got enough to take me home. okay. all right, so i'm a slob without the social graces. i'm a meatball married to a dime store queen. why do you bother changing? if you're going to act like an orangutan, you might as well look like one. i'm asking you for the last time to get your car out of the driveway, it's blocking mine. and i'm telling you for the last time, you're not going there alone. any speeches made at the country club tonight will be made by me. and if you so much as open your mouth about that cruise to new zealand, i'll tell them you haven't got the price to take a tin canoe up mcclusky's creek. good evening, mrs. forbes. dorothy! you come back here! i'm sorry for your troubles, john. it ain't my business, i understand, but it's not the way a woman should act. after all i told her, after everything i said. she's gonna run out of gas in that car. like i told you, it was almost dry. let her run out of gas. i hope she has a 6-mile hike in her open-toed shoes. oh, i better pick her up. pour yourself a drink and watch tv. i'll be 20 minutes, maybe half an hour. well, i'm back. i didn't see my wife. pour me a drink. i had an accident. did you hear what i said? i had an accident. anybody hurt much, john? you run into a car? no, it wasn't a car, it was somebody walking out on mosley road. a person's got no right to be walking after dark along a road like that. you better take that car right back to the lot now. we were here all night, right in this room, just the two of us. we were watching tv, you understand? come on. don't put the lights on, yet. come here. it's funny how it got busted. i don't know if somebody threw a rock at me or if a bear jumped out and bit a hole in it. you know what i mean? i've got a pair of '53 headlights on the lot. you take care of this, dad, and i'll take care of you. i figured you'd take care of me, john. you told me that before. mr. forbes? yes. i'm sorry to bother you at this time, mr. forbes. well, that's all right, i understand. you fellows have your jobs to do. hey, is that the one over there, pop? man, that must be the car. well, let's go. wow! guys, it'd take three years to knock the fenders off the crate. come on, how about it, pop? come on, how about it, pop? no, boys, not this one. got a souped-up motor and overdrive. the boss has got a couple of parties interested. oh, you're kidding. come along, i'll show you. what do you got in mind, pop, huh? well now, look. take this one. - for 50 bucks? - you're kidding. the rear end transmission's shot. now, the boss says if you take it away now, you can have it for your carnival. thanks, pop, thanks a lot. we estimate that your wife was knocked about 30 feet into that clump of shrubbery, mr. forbes. hit-and-run, you figure? yes and no. whoever it was sure ran, but there were some interesting tire tracks along the shoulder of the road. someone could have taken dead aim. do you think that's possible? anything is possible, mr. forbes. but we checked the tire tracks, they don't match those of your car or your wife's. come on, get it going. - hey, pops. - yeah, what's the matter? this thing won't run, the battery's dead. there's nothing the matter. just get it going, that's all, and back it out of here. come on, lester, give me a shove. try it again. i understand that you were home last night. yes, that's right. i was home all night. was anyone with you? yes, dad was. he's the man that works for me. he came over a little while after my wife left. what for? well, to keep me company. have a couple of drinks. i'm not much for the country club. all right, mr. forbes, i guess that's all for now. - thanks for your help. - that's all right. that the right mileage on this '56? one thing we never do is change the speedometers. not a bad buy at that price. hey, pop, where were you last night? me? i was out at john's. what time were you there? after 5:30. i guess i stayed till 10:00. well, what'd you do out there? oh, we had some drinks and watched some television. two westerns and a giveaway. come on, lester, give me a shove. john's very nice about those things. i had a chicken leg, some olives and a half box of candy. was mr. forbes there all night? sure he was there. him and me together, we had a ball. okay, come on, come on. harder, man. come on. all right, pop. thanks. i may call on you later to make it official. charlie? you think it went all right? it went better than that, dad. don't worry, i'll take care of you. i have to get back to the undertaker now. make it look good with the relatives. you don't have to worry about that car no more. i don't? them college boys was just here. they just bought that problem for 50 bucks. can i keep it, dad? why do you think i got it for you? how much was it? never mind how much it was. you didn't steal it, did you? no. nice carnival, huh? yes, it is. mr. forbes was very nice to me when i seen him this afternoon. he said you don't have to worry anymore about your job. john said that, huh? i guess that's the least he could say now. besides, mr. forbes gave me $10. $10 for what? he thought we might have a real nice time at the carnival. i thought maybe we could eat here tonight at the carnival, dad. well, maybe we will. come inside and see the death car. only 50 cents. three shots for 50 cents. all right, folks, come on, gather around, you only get three shots for half a rock now. come on, step inside. come on and shake the angel-cake out of your blood. come on, let's see how strong you are. step up, come on, sir. it may be the last chance you'll ever have to see that death car. - well, let's see, what do you say? - come on, that way. come on in, sir, come on in, now. come on, 50 cents, only 50 cents. three shots for 50 cents. come on, come on inside. come on! yeah! whoa! whoa! whoa! only three shots for 50 cents. thank you very much. who'll be next? step right up, sir! step right up! thank you, sir. roll your sleeve up a little higher so the ladies can see that pretty tattoo. this may be modern man's last chance to strike back at the industrial revolution, so watch this man go. you don't have to worry about that car no more. you couldn't tell it from a plate of pizzas. you didn't talk to anybody about it, did you? who? me? how would i talk? after all, we're kind of partners now. you know what i mean? no, what do you mean? i mean, i wouldn't want to mention that busted headlight. except a man my age, he's got to be practical. yeah, i suppose that's true. you said you'd take care of me. you told me you would. listen, john, i never said a word to a soul. all right, pop, carnival's over. you better come with us. you fellas are kidding, huh? yeah, that's right, pop. we're playing a game. the same as you were wednesday night, when you ran over mrs. forbes on mosley road. i'm telling you fellas, i was out at his house. we had some drinks and we watched a show. no, pop, you got there after mrs. forbes left. you saw her walking along the shoulder of the road, and then knocked her off like a 10 pin. he did it! he killed her! he didn't give away a $500 crate for 50 bucks, pop. not so that some crazy kids could whack it into junk. we checked with the boys at the college. i'm telling you, he hated her! you've got to listen to me! we're not checking into mr. forbes' love life, pop. the fact of the matter is he didn't have a broken headlight hidden in his house. at least not one that matched the glass we found on mosley road. come on, pop. kitty! kitty! kitty! did you hear dad? was he calling me? well, i'm not sure, he might have been. he's been a good husband to me, dad has. we ate out tonight, the two of us. i want to thank you for the $10, mr. forbes. that headlight you asked me about today. i never asked him why he had it hid. i get so nervous at night, when i can't find dad. would you take care of me? i'm sorry to say that honest alfred's cold war surplus store has been forced to close. our buyers just didn't keep up their monthly payments, and it was rather difficult for us to get in touch with them after they got into orbit. here's news from a more successful entrepreneur, after which i shall return. by the way, those of you who witnessed tonight's crime will be glad to learn that the party who perpetrated it has been justly punished. i refer not to the recent commercial, but to john forbes' murder of his wife. when i last heard, the person responsible for the commercial was still at large. the big ones always get away. next week, i shall be back with another story. until then, good night."
0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,"too hot? a little. ah. why don't you specify a lower temperature? no, no, no, no. coffee should be a little too hot to drink right away. why? it, uh, slows down the experience gives you time to savor the taste. ah, yes... taste. odo, i know you don't need to eat, but did you ever try it anyway? once. not long after i was first able to assume the humanoid form. and? and since i don't have taste buds it was very unsatisfying... not to mention messy. messy?! i'd rather not talk about it. major kira. how nice to see you again. tiron. you left quark's last night, just when i was about to buy everyone another round. i was devastated that you didn't say good-bye and we were having such a pleasant conversation. as i recall, you were the one doing all the talking. well, in that case, you have me at a disadvantage. you know all about me and i know next to nothing about you. uh... perhaps i should be going. oh, no. stay. this is tiron, a business associate of quark's. this is odo... my lover. well... you're a very lucky man. i'm a lucky woman. yes... we're both very lucky. and you make a most... interesting couple. so, mr. odo, what is it that you do? i'm chief of security on this station. oh. a station this size it must be a very challenging job. i hope you're well compensated. oh, money doesn't matter. all we need is each other. isn't that right... sweetheart? yes... sweetheart. you see, money isn't everything. oh, no, but it can buy everything. well, i'm afraid i must be going. good-bye. oh, good riddance. thank you, odo. wish you'd been around last night. i better get back to ops. see you later, sweetheart. commander's log, stardate 48423.2. despite the continuing threat posed by the dominion i've convinced starfleet that we must continue our exploration of the gamma quadrant. i've run a preliminary analysis of our sensor sweeps and the second planet in the kylata system is definitely m-class. i wish we'd had time to beam down to the surface and take a closer look. yeah, but i'd hate to have run into a jem'hadar patrol while we were down there picking flowers. fortunately, there's no sign of any dominion activity in this sector. and let's hope it stays that way. i'm picking up very unusual gravimetric distortions in the trialus system. any idea what's causing them? it's hard to tell at this range. let's take a closer look. the system's coming into visual range. on screen. the gravimetric distortions are intensifying but they don't seem to be coming from the star itself. but where else could they be coming from? there aren't any planets in this system. there are now. the planet seems to have settled into a stable orbit. but where did it come from? could the entire planet have been cloaked? if it was, there should be residual ionization traces but i'm not reading any. commander, we're being scanned. the beam is coming from a settlement on the southern hemisphere. i'm reading approximately 30 humanoid inhabitants. they seem to be the only humanoids on the planet. they're hailing us. open a channel. i'm commander benjamin sisko of the federation starbase deep space 9. i am seltin rakal of meridian. we were studying the star system when your planet appeared. i expect it must have come as something of a surprise. well, you could say that. it seemed to come out of nowhere. not nowhere, commander but from a dimension that intersects with this one. i could explain more in detail, if you're interested. we were just about to sit down for first meal. why don't you join us? we'd like that. i just need to know your planet is not going to disappear in the middle of dessert. don't worry. we'll be here for a while. it's good to be together around this table again after so long. what's more, we're fortunate to have visitors to share first meal with us. i was admiring... your markings. are they decorative? no. are yours? no. if you don't mind my asking... how far down do they go? all the way. ah. you're not eating, commander. i guess my curiosity is bigger than my appetite. i hope we can satisfy both. hmm. well, you were saying meridian emerged from a dimension that intersects with this one? yes. you see, our planet has a dual existence. it shifts between this dimension and another. what causes these shifts? well, we're not entirely sure. deral has been studying the phenomenon. with only limited success, i'm afraid. my theory is that the dimensional shifts are caused by fluctuations in meridian's quantum matrix-- fluctuations that are somehow triggered by our own sun. what's it like, this dimension of yours? it's hard to explain. it's... without form. we exist as pure consciousness. and meridian? it becomes non-corporeal as well but when we return to this dimension everything is just as we left it-- the buildings, the trees, even our bodies. are you saying that when you return here it's as if no time has passed? we only age when we're in corporeal form. sounds like this other dimension has its advantages. yes... but we always look forward to this existence and its many pleasures. oh, here, let me help you with that. the trick is to scoop out the pulp and eat the thin layer inside the rind. here, try some. it's delicious. especially if you've been looking forward to it for 60 years. 60 years? mm-hmm. huh. that's a long time between meals. a glass of andorian ale. done so soon? you were barely in the holosuite ten minutes. there was no reason for me to stay the full hour. i understand. it's a very... effective program. on the contrary, i found it to be quite dull-- boring, boring, boring! i'm sorry to hear you say that but if you're asking for a refund, forget it. the contract specifically says that satisfaction is not guaranteed. but... for a valued customer such as yourself i'll make an exception and allow you to try a different program... no extra charge. let's see. something a little bit more... unique? oh, i have just the thing-- ""a picnic with the pleasure goddess of rixx."" i can even provide real food, for a small fee, of course. i don't like picnics, quark, and the food here is abominable. forget the food. believe me, you've never had a picnic like this one. what i want is not in your catalog. well, tell me what it is and i'll order it for you. it may take some time, but, if it exists, i'll get it. that's just the point, quark. the program i want doesn't exist. not yet, anyway. a custom program... it'll be expensive. oh, for that kind of money, you can move into a holosuite. now, what is it you want? i want... major kira. kir... what are you going to do with kira in a holosuite? no... don't tell me. i don't want to know. can you do it? it isn't going to be easy. i'll have to get her into the holosuite and record her image, and she hates holosuites. spare me the details. do we have a deal or do i take my business elsewhere? consider it done. now, i'll just keep this... payment on delivery and not a moment sooner. don't disappoint me, quark. when i walk into that holosuite and i see kira standing there... i'd better believe it's really her. leave it to me. mm-hmm. the things i do for money. just beyond that forest there's a garden with a small pond. it sounds lovely. it is. deral, our scans show that there are only about 30 of you on this entire planet. well, there were never many of us. we're the descendants of an expedition that was stranded here millennia ago. and your population hasn't increased since then? it did for a time but over the last few centuries, our numbers have dwindled. you see, we only reproduce when we're in humanoid form and our time here keeps growing shorter. in 12 days, meridian will shift back to its non-corporeal state. and remain there for the next 60 years. eventually, we will only be here for a matter of minutes. when that happens, meridian will be too unstable to successfully shift back to the other dimension. and then what happens? the planet and all its inhabitants will cease to exist... in either dimension. we deeply appreciate your offer of help, commander. if there is a way to stabilize the dimensional shifts we'll do everything we can to find it. that's all we can ask. aha. here you go. do you want to play vajhaq with us? maybe later. deral and i are beaming up to the defiant. we're going to run a series of helio-seismic scans on the meridian sun. i'll join you. good luck. dabo! quark. i got a message that morn wanted to see me. i'm afraid you just missed him. really? so soon? would you come with me, please? listen up, everyone. i have wonderful news. it's my pleasure to announce that my one-millionth customer just walked through the door. and here she is, ladies and gentlemen major kira nerys. quark! i don't have time for this. why don't you make him your one-millionth customer? but, major, that would be dishonest. that never stopped you before. but this is a special occasion. an event like this only happens once in a bar owner's lifetime. let me tell you about your prizes. you mean, i won something? of course, you won something. it's part of the celebration. i never won anything before. well, now you have. congratulations. are you really serious about this? my customers are my livelihood, major. this is a chance for me to give something back to them. now, let's see what we have for you. a bottle of kandora champagne, vintage 2368-- that's a very good year. these are good for five free spins at the dabo wheel. and last but not least one free hour in a holosuite with the program of your choice. wait... a visit to a holosuite? offer good today only. but that's perfect. right this way. it's ensign quintana's birthday. he'd love a free visit to the holosuite. but, major, what about you? oh, you know how i feel about the holosuites, quark but, uh... thanks for the champagne. these are the defiant's sensor readings when we first entered the system. take a look at the spectral scan. it indicates that your sun was giving off modulated gamma bursts right before meridian appeared. my people have no record of that phenomenon. that's not surprising, since meridian was in a non-corporeal state when it occurred. gamma activity would seem to indicate an anomaly in your sun's fusion cycle. let's find out for sure. chief, i want you to send a probe into the sun's corona to scan the core. it'll take a minute to modify the shield configuration. how do modulated gamma bursts cause a dimensional shift? do you always do that when you're concentrating? do what? bite your lower lip. i guess i do. probe's ready, commander. target it to these coordinates and launch. shields are holding. it's going to be a while before the probe starts sending back any telemetry. well, i'm sure you have things you need to do. not really. what a coincidence. neither do i. this isn't turning out exactly the way i planned. what do you mean? you've barely spoken a word since we left the settlement. i don't know if you noticed or not but seltin didn't seem too happy to see us leave together. well, she'd probably prefer that i was... walking with keshara or renar. you see, ever since my wife died everyone's been wondering when i was going to find myself another companion. why haven't you? i guess i was waiting for the right woman to fall out of the sky. that doesn't happen too often. it only had to happen once. don't worry about seltin. after all, we both know this is just a... harmless little walk. absolutely. with a brief stop to climb a tree. come on. don't tell me in eight lifetimes you've never climbed a tree? that's how i know i'm afraid of heights. well, don't worry. i won't let you fall. this is one of my favorite views. it's hard to believe that it all might be gone in two weeks. i hope not. so do i. we better climb down. oh, it's as beautiful as you described. i knew you'd like it. try one. mmm! that's wonderful. i knew you'd like that, too. you know me pretty well for someone who just met me. i'm glad you noticed. i can't remember the last time i did this-- stroll through a garden, climb a tree eat fresh berries by a pond. what comes next? i think i'm starting to remember. how are the calculations coming? i'm checking them now. they're the same as before. there's nothing to indicate the gamma bursts are causing the quantum fluctuations. then something else must be triggering the dimensional shifts. whatever it is, we'll find it. sisko to dax. go ahead, commander. good news. we've been able to get the probe down another thousand kilometers into the sun's corona. we picked up some additional telemetry. i'll download it to you. thank you, chief. if all that fresh air and sunshine start getting to you you're welcome to come back up here to the defiant. we're managing just fine. i'm sure you are. sisko out. don't you want to take a look at the new telemetry? i'd rather sit here and look at you. how about this? we work for a few more hours and then we go back to your room and count each other's spots. oh, can i go first? we'll see. take a look at the fusion reactants in the core. they're out of balance. that's right, and the imbalance is building toward a cascade reaction on the quantum level. that's what's triggering the dimensional shifts. and if we can stabilize that reaction... we can keep meridian here longer. oh, jadzia! i've got to get this to commander sisko and chief o'brien. and then we can count each other's spots. these security protocols look fine, odo. just let me know... odo, move out of there. you're ruining my shot. odo... oh, uh, major... uh, why is quark trying to take a holo-picture of you? looks to me like he's pointing at both of us. true, but every time i stand in front of you he seems to get very upset. where are you going? uh-oh. what do you think you're doing, quark? - nothing. - hah! then what's this? oh, you mean this holo-imager. i was just recording an image of the promenade to send home to my mother. hah! you're trying to take a holoscan of me and i want to know why. of you? not at all. you just happened to get in the frame. hah! will you stop doing that? not until you start telling the truth. you want the truth? i'll tell you the truth. i was trying to get an image of you for a special holosuite program i'm designing. oh, i can just imagine what kind of program that would be. i'm sure you can, but you'd be mistaken. the fact is, i'm working on a simulation of the station's operations center. people want to know what goes on up there and they want to imagine themselves fending off a cardassian attack or facing a fleet of jem'hadar ships. naked, i assume. isn't there some petty thief you can harass? just you. what do you say, major? give the public what they want. they're not asking for much-- just the chance to work side by side with you. oh, they want to work with me? well, then let them apply to the bajoran military academy. that way, i can be sure everyone in ops is wearing their uniform. is that a no? well, let me put it another way-- if i ever catch you pointing a holo-imager at me again you will end up eating it. definitely a no. jadzia. i've been looking for you. you found me. i have. good news-- it's going to work. we'll be able to equalize the time between dimensional shifts. oh, jadzia, that's wonderful. do you know what i'm going to do? i'm going to build a house right here. nothing extravagant. just big enough for two. deral, i... i know what you're thinking. you're thinking this man that just met me is talking about building a home for us. i realize you have a life on deep space 9 but now, you'll have a place here as well... for when you visit. i won't be able to visit for a while. it's going to take a long time to stabilize the sun's cascade reaction. how long? meridian is going to shift in five days. jadzia... we'll see each other again. in 60 years. i want you with me now. that's what i want, too, but there's nothing we can do. yes, there is. i can leave meridian and go back to the alpha quadrant with you. if you'll have me. what do you think? deral! we've been looking for you. commander sisko told us the great news. i can't thank you enough for all you've done. i'm glad we were able to help. the next time meridian returns here we'll have 30 years for our people to get to know each other better. i need to discuss something with you. of course. i've called a meeting. now that we have a future again we need to start planning for it. and you need to make some decisions as well. that's what i want to talk to you about. the person you need to talk to is keshara. she's not going to wait for you forever, you know. i was going to speak to her as well. i'm glad. think of it, deral-- people can start having families again. eventually, we may have to expand the settlement. as you can see, jadzia we have a great deal of planning to do. well, i think i've kept the others waiting long enough. come, let's get started. you'd better go inside. i'll meet you back at the ship. you know, the person i feel sorry for is quark. he always thought that you and he were made for each other. i don't suppose he'll be letting you win at tongo anymore. what are you talking about? he doesn't let me win. come in. deral. well, it's done. i told seltin and the others that i'm leaving meridian. oh, what did they say? they asked me not to go. seltin feels the settlement can't afford to lose anyone. what did you tell her? i told her i understood her concern but that i've made up my mind. so, what were you two talking about before i interrupted? not me, i hope. well, actually, i was just telling jadzia that, uh, not as good a tongo player as she thinks she is. tonga? it's a game, and i'm very good at it. well, we'll find out on tuesday night. and i want you there to see for yourself. i'm going to clean you and quark out. jadzia, i have to go. but you just got here. there are some things i need to take care of before we leave meridian. do you need any help? no, i... i just have to say good-bye to some people. i'll see you later tonight. tiron, i was just thinking about you. and i was thinking about you, and your reputation as a man who can get anything for a price. stop. you're embarrassing me. i'll embarrass you even more if you don't get me my program. not to worry. is that it? no. it's a high-level decryption protocol. and i'm using it to get the final information i need for your program. it cost me dearly. if it works, it's worth whatever price you paid for it. i was hoping you'd say that. i'll put it on your bill. fine. just get me my program. i'm leaving in two days. you'll have it, and i assure you it'll be well worth the wait. i'll stake my reputation on it. you already have. now... where to begin, hmm? you wanted to see me? yes. someone has been illegally accessing the station's personnel files-- your file, to be exact. mine? they've downloaded your voice print, your retinal scan even your psychiatric profile. i've managed to trace the data path back to its source. well, let me guess-- quark. was there any doubt? oh, with all this information he'd have no problem generating a holo-image of me. so, shall i arrest him or would you prefer to do it yourself? no, i have a better idea. can you spare a few hours? i'd like to prepare a little surprise for quark. you see, the key to tongo is to confront when you're sure you're in a better position than the other players. and if your cards match the roll of the dice then you win. deral... go on, i'm listening. you haven't heard a word i've been saying, have you? i'm sorry. i just have so much on my mind. you don't want to leave meridian, do you? i said i would and i will. i know what you said, but what do you want? to be with you. but you're worried about your people. there are so few of us, jadzia and now that meridian has a future again, they need me. then you have to stay. and lose you? no. what if you didn't have to lose me? what if i stayed here with you? i wish you could, but that's not possible. your molecular structure wouldn't survive the dimensional shift. we could use a transporter buffer to match my quantum matrix to yours. but how do you know that's possible? because i discussed it with julian after you left my quarters. jadzia... are you sure you're willing to do that? it's the only way we can be together and i don't want to lose you either. come in. benjamin, i was just finishing up my request to starfleet for my leave of absence. i bet this is the first time anyone has requested a 60-year leave. you'll be sure that it gets to them? if you're sure that this is what you really want. what i really want is for you to say that you're happy for me. i guess i just need to know that you have thought this thing through. if curzon had told me he wanted to go off with some woman he just met i would have tried to talk him out of it, too. and you would have been right. he fell in love with someone new every other week. but i'm not curzon. no... and i've never seen jadzia do anything without thinking it through first. i am happy for you it's just... i'm going to miss you, old man. you've been my friend for two lifetimes. i can't imagine what it's going to be like not having you around. and leaving deep space 9 is the hardest thing i have ever done but i know it's right. besides, after eight lifetimes as a humanoid existing as pure consciousness might be interesting. next time we see each other i'll probably be a great-grandfather. good. then i can call you ""old man."" i'll look forward to it. now, i believe we agreed i'd be paid on delivery. i haven't seen the merchandise yet. you know, quark if this program is as good as you claim i might just purchase it from you to use at home. you have your own holosuite? just a little present i bought myself. his very own holosuite. hmm. it's good to have money. i've been waiting for you. quark! i will ruin you for this, quark! you mean you didn't like the program? i don't know how, i don't know when but i will ruin you. wait! what about my money? another satisfied customer, quark? how do you feel? pretty good, considering i spent six hours having my molecules scrambled in the transporter. i, um... i don't know what to say. that's a first. according to deral's calculations the dimensional shift should occur within the next 47 minutes. do you think you'll be done overhauling the station by the next time i see you? i doubt it. tell quark i'll be back to collect the three strips of gold latinum he owes me with 60 years' interest. energize. i was beginning to think you were having second thoughts. no, just saying good-bye. you missed last meal. i saved you some of these. thank you. jadzia, i just wanted you to know how happy we are you've decided to join us. thank you. everyone's beginning to gather. it's almost time. is there anything i need to do to prepare? not that i can think of. what if i just hold onto you? after all, we're not going to be together again like this for a long time and... i was just getting used to this. we'll still be together, jadzia... in a way you can't even imagine. there she goes. good-bye, jadzia. something's wrong. commander, i'm reading intense seismic activity throughout the planet's crust. it better shift soon or it's going to tear itself apart. jadzia. i'm picking up some kind of singularity in the planet's quantum matrix. it's interfering with the dimensional shift. it's functioning almost like an anchor. commander, it's dax. her presence there is destabilizing the matrix. sisko to dax. get her out of there, chief. i thought you'd like to know that meridian shifted normally once we beamed you away. ah... good. jadzia... i'm sorry. benjamin, don't. there's nothing you can do. uh, i just need some time. just 60 years or so."
1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"[theme music] if a bucket of paint falls on a man's head, that's funny. if the bucket fractures his skull at the same time and kills him, that's not funny. it's tragic. and yet if a man falls into a sausage machine, and is sold in the shops at so much a pound, that's funny. it is also tragic. so why is it funny? i don't know. but what i do know is that somewhere within this very difficult area lies the secret of all black comedy. the play you're going to see now is one of those blackish comedies. and thanks to the presence of two famous stars, it's come out a good deal funnier than i was ever able to make it on paper. [music playing] lady turton, who ran her husband's newspaper empire as aggressively as she ran his house in norfolk, didn't know that sir basil had invited an extra guest for the weekend, john bannister. gently. it's irreplaceable. jelks. milady. lady turton: what is going on? basil! basil. have you gone out of your mind? hello, my dear. what on earth is this tradesmen's van doing at the front? it's my latest acquisition. quite wonderful. basil. what will my guests think? really, basil, you've no style, no style at all. [music playing] this way. [bells toll] here. [car horn honks] evening, jelks. jelks: oh, good evening, sir. who else we got for the weekend? hardly anyone, sir. yourself and miss carmen la rosa, and a young friend of sir basil's, i believe, sir. the young chap blocking the drive. very possibly, sir. good looking, is he? presentable? bit of young blood? i have no idea, sir. you will find lady turton in the library, sir. thank you. send up my bags, will you? i'll change first. [soft music playing] isn't she beautiful? thank you. thank you. ah, you made it. good. well, what do you think? she's just arrived. i like it. she looks better than when we saw her last in the sale room, don't you think? no comparison. oh, i realize i paid over the odds. but we couldn't let her go to dusseldorf, could we? anyway, i had to have her. she fills a real gap in my collection. i like the way he's used the natural grain of the wood. uh, don't tell lady turton that. she hates what she calls art talk. major haddock: can't imagine what he was doing, young idiot. ah, a young man in a sports car. parked his pedal car all over the drive. i, uh, blasted him with my horn. jelks tells me he's basil's guest. hmm. i say, does he ride? oh, we'll have to see. it is basil's guest. he's bound to be a drip. well, now. i take that back. my dear, may i introduce john bannister? we happened to meet at southerly's. oh, basil haunts that place. every honest penny i earn, he spends on art. how do you do? how do you do, lady turton? oh, natalia, please. basil, do get this presentable young man a drink. come. jelks: allow me, sir. carmen, john. carmen la rosa. - how do you do? - [inaudible] are you horsey? not really, no. oh. then we won't have anything to say to each other. what do you do? i'm an art historian. [carmen gulps] oh my god, how awful for you. jelks, get me another martini. i've just met an art historian. [major haddock guffaws] oh, i think you've met jack, major haddock. in a way, yes. how do you do? evening. stupid place to leave a car. i was admiring the view. don't we all? basil, for god's sake, take our guest upstairs. i cannot stand tweeds after 6:00. i can't wait to see you in a black tie. [music playing] there's an admired view of the garden, sir. bathroom in here. beware of the flush, sir. it's quite powerful. oh, thank you. dinner at 7:30, sir. thank you. don't bother with the, uh-- no bother, sir. that catch is rather tricky. i seem to have got the better of it, sir. there's hardly anything to hang up. i just threw in a few things. quite, sir, just a weekend bag. look, really, i'd rather you didn't. it's, um-- do you play bridge, sir? yes, as a matter of fact, i do. ah, well, then you will be doubly welcome here, sir. believe me. they play a lot of bridge, do they? yes, sir. and poker, and gin rummy. sir basil prefers bridge. i see you favor the modern approach to evening dress, sir. what? snap on, snap off. it, it's a bit creased. you laundered it yourself, sir? it's drip dry. quite. i can't wear manmade fabrics myself. i find the static electricity it generates inconvenient. one tends to give off blue flashes in the dark. that will be all, jelks. oh, but your pumps, sir. pumps? your evening footwear, sir. they may require polish, possibly. no. no, they're fine, really. as you will, sir. i'll just leave you to it, then. thank you. thank you, sir. yes, of course. i never accept emoluments, sir. no tips? if i might offer a little further advice, sir? yes? it's simply that her ladyship does somewhat tend to overbid her hand. thank you, jelks. oh, one further point, sir. at dinner. - yes? her ladyship's right foot doesn't always seem to know what her left foot is doing. that will be all, jelks. i sincerely hope so, sir. lady turton: so what exactly do you specialize in, as an art historian? uh, renaissance. basil used to call me his memling madonna. but i always saw myself more like that. the telephone, milady. oh, what a bore. who is it? the editor of the sunday globe, milady. [sighs] i am a slave to basil's inheritance. now his father, what a magnificent man he was. basil, wasn't your father a magnificent man? yes, dear. very forthright. like you. mmm, brilliant. built an international newspaper empire out of the coarse fishermen's gazette. such animal magnetism, even on his deathbed. but does his son take after him? well. the editor is waiting, milady. he needs to know how many nudes you require for the front page of the northern edition, milady. thank you, jelks. i shall tell him to think big. amazing woman. one for the book, eh? yes. major haddock: tell me, what do you think of basil's art collection? a load of rubbish? quite the reverse. major haddock: oh. i don't know what you chaps see in it. well, for a start, it must be worth millions. really? well, that's put the fear of god into him. oh, basil. haven't you finished eating yet? he is the slowest eater in the world. nibble, nibble, nip. thank you, jelks. tell cook the poached salmon was abominable. with pleasure, milady. i know how she values your opinion. splendid [inaudible]. i feel very replete. well, what's it to be tonight? gin rummy? liar dice? stripped poker? bridge. one spade. three clubs. three hearts. no bid. three no trumps. - no bid. - no bid. no bid. lady turton: must you always bid three no trumps, basil? it makes the game so dull, so, so unadventurous. not if one wins, dear. what's the idea, man? i didn't ask for another scotch. no, sir, but as things are looking, you may well need one, sir. are you still losing? hand quad score, sir? no, you may not. in fact, jelks, you can go to bed. this is our last hand. very good, milady. mr. bannister and i are 1,200 up, jelks. how very gratifying, sir. good night, sir. no go. it's all yours. we overbid, natalia. i've told you before. oh, jack. no post-mortems. you know i can't stand post-mortems. basil, since winning's obviously worn you out, i suggest you go to bed, too. i am rather tired, dear. oh, we'll settle in the morning, right? [bell tolls] [door handle rattling] as a house guest, mr. bannister, you leave a lot to be desired. do i? beating your hostess at bridge? jack's furious. and then locking your door. [clicks tongue] such ingratitude. besides, i have a key to every bedroom in this house. all 47 of them. 47? striped pajamas? i'm cold-blooded. oh? oh. and a bow. how sweet. how old-fashioned. just, uh, think of this is your bread-and-butter letter, darling, written in advance. [both moan] jelks! forgive me, milady. i thought i heard an intruder. you are the intruder, jelks. could i be of any service to you, sir? um, no, i'm-- go away, jelks! hearing strange sounds, i took the precaution of alerting sir basil, milady. as a butler, jelks, you'd make a perfect baby-minder. i hope i've been of some service, sir. i suppose so, yes. if i might suggest it, a chair braced firmly under the door knob is quite the best deterrent. her ladyship has been known to sleepwalk before dawn. good night, jelks. good night, sir. [music playing] [music playing] when my father died, i was taken rather by surprise. up until then, i'd lived a very quiet bachelor life. then suddenly at 40, i seemed to have become enormously eligible. young ladies appeared from nowhere. oh, i bought that head last march. john: a frank? yes. and then natalia appeared, and literally swept me off my feet. all the others were rather miffed. she is very striking. oh, and a wonderful head [inaudible],, isn't it? though, i must say, she has rather changed the tone of our various publications. but the cash does roll in. who is for a gallop? we're coming. jack! let her go. oh! [lady turton screams playfully] did you sleep well last night? yes, eventually. jelks told me he thought he heard an intruder. false alarm. quite. jelks is very loyal. lady turton: jack! you will ruin my [inaudible]. you are insatiable. saddle horse and away! oh, i love this place, every inch of it. major haddock: yoinksy, yoinksy, yoinksy. lady turton: oh, look. this is basil's new masterpiece. isn't it ghastly? major haddock: watch the dickey bird. take one like this. oh, that's very good. tally-ho! shall we go down? it's very pleasant here. [camera clicks] major haddock: oh, yes, brilliant. just like those things at the seaside. how is it? oh, it's bloody marvelous. idiot. got you. how now, my proud beauty? [both moan] natalia finds everything so amusing. jack, i'm stuck. you can't be. lady turton: i am. oh, rubbish. what goes in must come [inaudible].. jack! do something. oh, flatten your ears back. i am not a horse, damn it. oh, dear. ow! ow! ah! ahhh! ow! what is it? natalia's stuck. well, well, get something quickly. butter. lard. anything. i got my fist stuck in a jar of boiled sweets once. couldn't get it out. finally i broke the jar with a hammer, and told my mother it fell off the shelf by mistake. i suppose we ought to help, really. i suppose so, yes. quite. cigarette? virginia, this side. turkish, that. i don't, thank you. i do. i think a turkish. [groaning] what are you doing? better take the jacket off. all right. yes. yes. come on, girl. no! oh, jack, i, i can't. i can't. ow! what a stupid thing. it's not funny. no. well, we'll just have to wait for carmen. oh, god. now look who's here. basil, get me out of here! what's the matter, dear? isn't it obvious? stuck her head through the blasted hole. can't get it out. how odd. just for a lark, you know. quite. a bit of fun, as it were. lady turton: basil, don't be such a damn fool. well, it's pretty obvious we'll just have to break up this, um, lump of wood. surely not. no, petroleum jelly should do the trick. ah. you thought of it already. allow me. good. oh, you're not going to smother me in that muck. basil! keep still, dear. ow! no! oh. oh, basil. [sobbing] oh, it's revolting. can't hurt, dear. if anything, rather soothing. [lady turton groans] that's right, on the ears. plenty on the ears. oh, how dare you. oh, this is so humiliating. oh, basil. oh, look at you. you're enjoying this, aren't you? you beastly little rabbit of a man! i reckon my old [inaudible] would get her out. [inaudible] that's the answer. poor maddie. try now, a good strong pull from the hips. [lady turton groans] oh, i must look ghastly. to [everyone groans] it's no go. we will stay to the right. you take the left leg. you, too. come on. now, you take the left. that's right. both of you. that's right. up. now, ready, steady, go. lady turton: ow! put me down! [music playing] let me down! you! hit my husband for me! i'm sure he's doing his best, lady turton. traitor! no! perhaps we should call the fire brigade. oh, and have them see me looking like this. ah, jelks. an unusual occurrence, sir. quite. i presume it is the ears that are the main obstruction, sir. could well be. they do tend to swell in moments of excitement. jelks? milady? please. do something constructive. we are considering ways and means, milady. i said so. chop the damn thing up. chop up a masterpiece? no question, man. all right, basil. come on. get on with it. her ladyship is right, sir. no time like the present, i always say. the saw or the axe, sir?

(dog snarling) it didn't work. louise. louise... make it go away. i hate you! i wish you were dead! (screaming): no! no! no. stop it. stop it. stop it! (whispering): i can't. i can't. where will i send you? i don't know where to send... come. come on. come home. (barks) (sighs) (birds chirping outside) (door opening softly) (door closing) where the hell do you think you're going? away, jack. away from you. is that so? think i'm just going to let you leave after what you did to me? you sent your little friend away, remember? and now i got a score to settle with you, little lady. you leave, and i'm coming after you. no, you won't. (dog barking) louise simonson-- driven by pain and anger into the desperate regions of the human heart, only to discover the preeminence of her own personal power. an act of recognition that reverberates in and out ofthe twilight zone."

""boffed""? did you just say ""boffed""? it's the type of thing he would have said. i mean, hell, it's not like i was doing anything else. well, i guess that's one way to deal with unrequited love, huh? all love is unrequited, stephen. all of it. - you're late. - no, no, no. you're early. i am never premature. oh, well, that is a surprise, given what i've heard. i'm sure it's a matter of perspective, really, but for a narn... ...two minutes must be a long time. so if you go the duration, it's an accomplishment. but for the centauri, hours can go by before you even get to the good parts. londo. - you're late. - i'm sorry. i'm sorry. it was just that... you know, this is a matter of state business. i think we should... oh, yes, yes, of course. g'kar, go on ahead. we'll join you shortly. oh, g'kar, when we are en route to earth... ...i will give you some ideas how to deal with your little problem. - what problem? - oh, no, it's nothing. we are developing a very strange relationship, i think. at times, i find i rather enjoy it. it doesn't matter. what is it, vir? i received a message from homeworld just before i came here. the regent is ill. they want you to come home. what can i do? i am not a doctor. it's much more than that, londo. they say the regent will leave us early in the coming year. when that happens, the royal court has decided... ...that we need your voice to guide us. you're going to be emperor, londo. isn't that wonderful? yes, vir, wonderful news. - londo, i thought you... - come, we really should hurry. otherwise we'll have to put up with a cranky narn all the way to earth. hello, captain. i hope you don't mind my stopping by to visit. i told the staff we were such good friends... ...like holmes and watson, rebo and zooty. fire and water, snake and mongoose. this will let us speak privately for a few minutes... ...before they decide it's more than ordinary interference. you never come at anyone straight out, do you, mr. bester? mr. garibaldi told me what you did to him. used him to uncover a plot against the psi corps. well, i'm sure mr. garibaldi believes... ...l'm responsible for a lot of things. like the murder of william edgars. so tell me... ...what happened to those vials that were stolen from his safe? you know, the ones with the anti-telepath virus. i don't know what you're talking about. but if there were such a thing... ...steps would be taken to destroy the virus... ...but we'd keep the antidote around just in case someone else came up with it. what about his wife, lise? i have no information about her. she's no longer any concern of mine. as for the rest... ...it's mr. garibaldi's word against mine... ...unless you'd like to bring in a telepath... ...to scan him, prove that what he's saying is true. of course, to be admissible in an earth court... ...the teep would have to be a member of the psi corps. you really think you've got it all covered, don't you? almost. except for one thing. i want to know if my lover... ...was one of the telepaths you used to disable the fleet in your little war. because if she was... ...and if she was killed because of it... ...you have to understand... ...that you will not leave this room alive. i find it amazing that you think that threats still mean anything to me. ""do this, or you're a dead man""? death: been there, done that. not a threat, captain, simply a statement of fact. i can have half a dozen sharpshooters cover this building at every exit. as soon as you poke your head outside, they'll put a bullet through it. you know what the difference is between you and me, bester? you use people because you like it... ...and if someone gets hurt in the process, well, that's life. using telepaths... ...to take over ships from the other side was the hardest decision i ever made. i had franklin go through their files, pick out the ones that were single... ...no families, who were almost certainly incurable. carolyn is single. she has no family. the only thing we ever had was each other. i know. i know what it's like to lose someone... ...only to find her, then lose her a second time. i wouldn't wish that on anyone, not even you, as much as i might want to. now, we selected 30 telepaths for that job, 30 out of 100. carolyn's still back at babylon 5. she'll be transferred here as soon as things settle down. thank you. oh, don't thank me yet. we're not done. see, i know you. even with clark gone, you'll keep moving your telepaths into positions of power. and then when the time is right, you'll try and take over the government. you're delusional, captain. oh, you'll wait a few years until things quiet down. and then you'll start a war between the telepaths and normals. and in the end, mr. bester, you will lose. we'll see. assuming you make it that far. see, mr. garibaldi is finishing up some personal business on mars. once it's done, i imagine he'll turn his attention to you. and to tell you the god's honest truth... ...l'd rather face those sharpshooters of yours than what he'll do when he finds you. i don't know exactly how he plans to settle the score, but i... i'm sure it'll be creative, colorful and extremely unpleasant. - where is she? - i don't know what you're talking about. no? then maybe i'm just gonna have to explain it to you again. now, her name's lise hampton. married to one of the richest guys on mars. she got into trouble. she went to the mars mafia, tried to bribe her way off the planet. she didn't make it. i figure they got a little greedy... ...decided to hang on to her until they could exchange her for credits. - i don't know what you're talking about. - really? you're the best black-market accountant on mars. if somebody wanted to launder money so it couldn't be traced, they'd come to you. - i can't... - give me a name, max! give me a name, and i'll let you walk out of here with your spine in one piece. they'll kill me. well, then you better decide what you prefer. now, do you want to die fast... ...or do you want to spend the rest of your life eating all your meals through a straw? - hello, delenn. - ambassador. i suppose i should say emperor, but you... you have heard that already? i've just found out myself. there is little that doesn't reach me these days. g'kar, londo, please sit. have you heard from sheridan? not since he turned himself over to his people. the other ambassadors from the league of non-aligned worlds will be here shortly... ...but i wanted you to be the first to see this. obviously, we will need your support. your governments have considerable influence with the league worlds. are you sure you want to do this, delenn? yes, i think it's the only way. i see nothing amusing in this situation, londo. no, no, you're right. there isn't. it's just that... ...l'm so rarely in the presence of living history. it thins the atmosphere, makes you giddy. you realize that you are quite mad for even considering this? perhaps. - please, come in. - yes, do please, come in. delenn has a fascinating proposal for you all. i hope you have brought a change of underwear. you will need it after you read this. - captain. - general, i am tired of sitting here. if you're going to press charges, please do so. we've finished our deliberations. the president's waiting outside. she'd like to speak to you, assuming you have nowhere else to go. no, no, please. ten-hut. as you were. well, captain, you caused quite a stir. half of earthforce wants to give you a kiss on the cheek and the medal of honor. the other half wants you taken out and shot. as a politician, you learn how to compromise... ...which by all rights means i should give you the medal of honor... ...then have you shot. i confess the idea had a certain appeal... ...when i mentioned it to the joint chiefs a few hours ago. sit. yes, ma'am. i'll give it to you straight, captain. president clark was out of control. many of us wanted to move against him, but the time was never right. with all due respect, ma'am... ...while you were waiting, innocent civilians were dying. there were issues of planetary security to consider. to look weak or disorganized would be to invite an invasion. we couldn't take that risk. his people were everywhere. he would have known instantly if we were up to something. ironically, by breaking away, you were the only one who could move against him... ...without his knowing what you were up to. that's why he was obsessed with you. babylon 5 was outside his control. so, yes, you saved some lives. i'm not here to argue ethics with you, captain. right or wrong, you led an insurrection against your own government. that's mutiny at best... ...treason at worst. so morally, i was right, but politically, i'm inconvenient. inconvenient doesn't even begin to cover it. now we have to clean up the mess. we can do that with or without your help. what do you want me to do? i've scheduled a press conference for tomorrow morning. i want you there. the event will be covered on isn. you will explain that you did what you did for the good of earth... ...but your conscience does not permit you to remain in earthforce any longer. you'll tender your immediate resignation... ...and i'll see to it you will retain your military pension with full honors. and i'll guarantee amnesty for your officers and crew... ...who served under you during this crisis. but i want you gone. and if i refuse? you'll be dishonorably discharged... ...court-martialed and brought to trial. same for lvanova and the rest of your staff. and i'll make sure that the military tribunal... ...is stacked with generals from the ""shoot him"" category. don't make the mistake of assuming that this is a conversation. it isn't. you have no other options. the bitch of it is that you probably did the right thing. but you did it in the wrong way. in the inconvenient way. and now you have to pay the penalty for that. i know it stinks... ...but that's the way it is. so you tell me... ...which way do you want it? will you put the amnesty for my crew in writing? then i'll resign. it's about time. get in here. - did you tell him we got her? - yeah. so how much is it worth to them to get her back alive before i have...? what's going on over there? what the hell is that thing? bring it on over here. that's all, folks. what the...? lise. lise. lise. - lise. lise, where are you? - here! i'm in here! lise, back away from the door. oh, baby, come on. are you all right? i'm okay. i knew you'd come for me, michael. come on, we got to get out of here. come on. we're entering earth's space, delenn. delenn? it is done, lennier. the others have voted on our proposal. when we are finished... ...they will talk about this day for 100 years. i only wish... i wish marcus could be here to see it. i will confess that i got used to seeing him walking on the path beside us. he was a part of us. but as long as we speak his name, he will always be a part of us. he followed the path of his heart. how many of us can say that? his life before he came to the rangers was not a happy one. he blamed himself for the death of his brother, so many others. perhaps... perhaps saving lvanova was the only way he could find peace. delenn... ...did they tell you what lvanova said at the end? ""all love is unrequited."" yes, they told me. she's wrong, of course. of course. continuing our coverage of breaking events in the fall of president clark's regime... ...we go now to the presidential suite in earth dome. fellow citizens of earth... ...honored guests... ...i have come before you today to commemorate those... ...who have taken part in this recent struggle. who fought as they believed they had to fight. their choice was an unenviable one. follow the orders of your superior officer... ...in acts that violate your conscience... ...or rise up in opposition. both sides have risked much and suffered greatly... ...but in the end, the battle they fought was the same. to protect and preserve an earth... ...they could proudly call home. caught in the center of this particular whirlwind... ...was a man of great integrity... ...honor and courage. but his task was a difficult one... ...but he executed it with care... ...to preserve the lives of his fellow officers. despite what you may have heard... ...in his heart, he never left us. i give you captain john j. sheridan. thank you, madam president. as a young man... ...i joined earthforce... ...because i wanted to be part of something bigger than i was... ...something that i could believe in. and that belief carried me through the mars riots, the minbari war... ...and the battles that have brought us here today. everything i did i did out of love of earth and love of duty. but what happens when those two are no longer the same thing? now, the time i spent on babylon 5... ...i learned about choices and consequences and responsibility. i learned that we all have choices, even when we don't recognize them... ...and that those choices have consequences... ...not just for ourselves, but for others. and we must assume responsibility for those consequences. i and my fellow officers... ...had to choose between what we were told was right... ...and what we believed was right. and now i take full responsibility for those decisions. i love earth. and now for my love of earth... ...i find i must walk away from my love of duty. my presence would be a constant reminder of what has divided us... ...instead of that which brings us together. and for that reason... ...and president luchenko's generous offer of amnesty... ...for all those who served under me... ...l'm announcing my resignation from earthforce. i do this in the hope that those who fought on both sides... ...will put aside their disagreements... ...and come together in a new spirit of cooperation. for we are all children of earth. thank you. to commemorate this very special day... ...the league of non-aligned worlds... ...asked to address this gathering. ambassador. for many years... ...all of us here have prized our good relations with earth. you have shown through your example... ...that strength comes from a multitude of voices... ...brought together in common cause. humans form communities. in that spirit, we have voted to dissolve the league of non-aligned worlds... ...and create a new alliance... ...based on mutual cooperation and respect. an alliance born in the diverse voices of many worlds... ...joined by their desire to build a better future... ...and their decision to voluntarily recognize a common authority. ambassador. this new alliance will help less-advanced worlds improve their conditions. it will encourage better relations between our races and promote free trade. above all, it will work to create peace. central to this process is a group of humans and minbari... ...trained to work together... ...and dedicated to the higher principles of duty, honor and peace. they have been entrusted with the most advanced fleet of ships in existence... ...now that the first ones have left us. among my people, they are called the anla'shok. among your people, they are called the rangers. they come in peace, and will stay only where they are invited to stay. they will help protect you from raiders and invasion by other races. they will work with your military to strengthen your borders... ...but understand that they will do so equally and fairly. if you plan a war of aggression against your neighbors... ...the rangers will hear about it, and so will your neighbors. if other worlds in the alliance... ...choose to intervene on behalf of those being attacked... ...the rangers will provide the information but will not intervene directly. their goal is to create the peace, not enforce the peace. this is a political and economic alliance... ...not one based on military strength. the gains you will achieve by working peacefully with other races... ...far outweigh anything you might achieve by force. the alliance recognizes your sovereign right... ...to govern your own people by your own will... ...but membership in the alliance means that you will honor a code of conduct... ...in your relations with other worlds... ...or risk losing all the things we stand to give you. finally, each member race will be able to contribute volunteers to join the rangers... ...thereby assuring their independence and fairness. all of us have agreed to recognize the independent authority of the rangers. madam president, honored guests... ...i now invite you to join the new alliance. you may decline if that is your wish. we will leave in peace and honor your decision. if you accept... ...we believe it will signal a new age of peace and prosperity. the invitation to join your new alliance is tempting, ambassador... ...but many of our generals are skeptical about your claims to neutrality. i fully understand, madam president. no one in this room is more suspicious of these things than i am. no race more prideful than the centauri. but we are tired of war... ...and believe that this will help to create peace between us. peace is a concept. if i'm going to sell this to my generals and the public... ...l'm going to need something a little more tangible. then you will have it. in the past, we have kept many of our technological advances to ourselves. in a gesture of good faith... ...we will show you how to use energy fields to create gravity in your ships... ...eliminating the need to manufacture slower, less-efficient ships... ...that rotate to create gravity. as a space-faring race dependent upon trade with other worlds... ...l'm sure you see the advantage in this. it's tempting. if... if we decide to pursue this... ...who should we negotiate with? - you? - no. the three of us make up the advisory board of the new alliance. we have a duly elected president, as you do. and where can i find this president? - you?! - funny thing about retiring... ...you no sooner pick out the places you want to go on vacation... ...than someone comes at you with a job offer. where's the certificate of amnesty? oh, that. i gave copies of that to the reporters outside... ...and the original is someplace safe. you knew this was coming the whole time, didn't you? the main thing was to protect my crew from retaliation. as for the new job, well... ...i was hoping the league worlds would pull it together, but you never know. i guess the war finally taught them that we are better together than apart. we've been building this thing up for months, bit by bit... ...making them rely more and more on the rangers and each other. but if they decided against the alliance... ...or if they wanted somebody else, well, i was fine with that too. general. john, there is someone here you may want to see. hey, dad. - are you okay? - i'm fine, son. - yeah? - yeah. as soon as you got out, they started being real nice to me all of a sudden. they figured out they were on the wrong side, and there'd be hell to pay. oh, you bet. - how's mom? - they never got near her. she's with friends in minneapolis. i hear you're going to be my daughter-in-law. yes. - well, welcome to the family. - thank you. it's been a while since i had a place where i truly belonged. captain... mr. president... ...president luchenko is waiting for you, sir. thank you. mr. president? - it's a... - another long story. well, there will be plenty of time for stories later. all the time in the world. good evening. we begin our broadcast tonight with a special report... ...providing continuing coverage on the unfolding babylon 5 story. president susanna luchenko met today... ...with representatives of the newly formed interstellar alliance. in a historic move, earth has agreed to join forces with the new alliance. in the same press conference... ...the newly elected president of the interstellar alliance, john sheridan... ...had this surprising revelation. now, in order to join the alliance... ...the rights of the colony worlds must be respected. if a majority of their population votes for independence, they must be freed. later this afternoon, president luchenko will sign an executive order... ...declaring mars a free and independent world. obviously this will have to be ratified by the senate. - so? - so. have you decided yet whether you're going back to babylon 5? no, not yet. i mean, zack's got things under control. i'm really in no rush to make up my mind... ...and i haven't had a vacation in five years. i think i'm due at least a few days. you know, i'm gonna need someone to help me run edgars industries. oh, boy, we do that... ...they're gonna say that i married you for your money. let them. then i'll tell them the real reason. oh, yeah? and what's that? let me tell you something. don't. don't. don't do that to me. no, no, no. come on. the sun is almost coming up. i have got to get some sleep eventually. in related babylon 5 news, in one of his last acts as an officer in earthforce... ...captain john sheridan promoted susan ivanova to the rank of full captain. citing the death of a close friend and personal reasons... ...captain ivanova has asked for and received a transfer... ...to one of the new warlock-class destroyers for a one-year shakedown cruise. in a statement issued a few hours ago, captain ivanova said only: ""i need to decide where my heart belongs before the rest of me can follow."" after the press conference in earth dome this morning... ...sheridan and delenn left for babylon 5. it's rumored that they were married in a private ceremony... ...aboard one of the white star ships. sources tell isn they will head up the newly formed alliance from babylon 5... ...until more permanent facilities can be located in tuzanor... ...on the minbari homeworld. off. so... ...how does it feel to make history? you do not make history. you can only hope to survive it. - g'kar, you are a depressing person. - thank you. and stop eating that. you don't even know what it is. something called rice. yes, and if it were very good... ...do you think they would have been standing there throwing it at people? as marriage ceremonies go, the humans are very strange indeed. still, they are quite a couple, aren't they? yes, they are. almost makes you wish that you could peek in on them... ...see how it's going. g'kar, the artificial eye that dr. franklin gave you... ...where is it? it was the end of the earth year 2261... ...and it was the dawn of a new age, for all of us. it was the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. the next 20 years would see great changes... ...great joy and great sorrow. the telepath war, the drakh war. the new alliance would waver and crack... ...but in the end, it would hold... ...because what is built endures... ...and what is loved endures. and babylon 5... babylon 5... ...endures.

0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"good evening, and thank you for being so prompt. i detest being kept waiting. i thought you might be interested in this collection of gift selections. they range from conventional to rare. here is the ever popular revolver. it is an excellent means of establishing credit in a strange city. it is equally useful in the removal of unwanted or unsightly persons. here is a jar of poison mushrooms for those smart alecks who know toadstools when they see them. here we have a weapon that is primitive but effective. it is guaranteed to be 50% painless. you, see, it takes two men to operate it and the one at this end doesn't feel a thing. and for the hausfrau whose aim with the family china is not what it use to be, here is a very handsome item, an exploding cream pitcher. says on it, ""god bless our happy home."" as for tonight's story i won't tell you whether or not any of these weapons are used. you'll have to watch and see. i did think i had an example of a blunt instrument to show you. ah, yes, what could be more blunt than the following? honey, we've been through this before. why not? look, are you going to do it or not? i can't do it, janice. i can't. why not, stan? why can't you? it's just not right, that's all. please, stan. you said you'd do anything for me. you promised. two lemonades, fifty cents. well, it just so happens i didn't order lemonade. the lemonade's all you're getting. no alcoholic beverage under 21. it's legal. see. oh, that. well, it just so happens i'm over 21. jannie. this place makes me sick. come on. come on, i'll take you home. we don't belong here. where do we belong, in kindergarten? too young for this, too young for that. stan, take me away from this town, aunt mae, that awful house. i can't stand it anymore. i'll just die, that's all. what's the use of harping on all that, jannie? lt'll just make it tougher now. your aunt mae is not so bad. maybe her house is a little old fashioned, but you don't if you'd just give me a chance to get set i told you i can't wait. besides it wouldn't be any different with you. you don't want to live. you just want to wait. for pete's sake, jannie, i'm only 18. that's true. you know, come to think of it you're really dance with me, stan. i'm too young for you. then i'll just find somebody else who isn't. honey, let's go. jan. janice, come on. come on, everybody let's give the little girl a big hand. please, let's go. hi. you know something? you're good. i've been around a lot. i know when something's good. so do i. i'm not kidding. you're going home before don't paw me! i don't like it! he makes me sick. what's your name? mine's janice. tex. thanks, i think i will. i'm not allowed to smoke at home. you're pretty and you're honest too. it's a combination you can't find too often. it's easy to be honest with strangers. look, maybe you shouldn't hang around here. you know, like your boyfriend said you could get in trouble. not unless i wanted to. you're not from around here, are you, tex? no, i'm not from anywhere in particular. i just sort of move along from there to here and do whatever suits me, like now. sounds lovely. take me with you. what? now wait a minute, sister. you got the wrong guy. you see, i live with this perfectly awful aunt and i you wouldn't have to care about me, or anything like that. i just need an escort so i can learn how to find looks to me like you already know how to do that. i'm gonna check out of here before i get into trouble. you're afraid of me. well, like you said, strangers can be honest. i sure am, doll baby, so long. you don't have to run. i'll go. anyway, stan's waiting outside for me. how do you know? he always waits. is that what you like, somebody to wait for you? i would, if it were you. well, so long, stranger. it still smells of dinner. jan. i'm sorry it turned out to be such well, anyhow. i'm sorry. good night, jan. don't you want to kiss me? you'll wake aunt mae. did you really mean it about letting me kiss you? why not? i like being kissed. oh, janice, i don't understand you take me away. please take me away. if you don't i swear i'll get somebody who will. i can't stand it. darling, don't. it'll be all right. everything will be all right. janice? is that you? you've got to go. aunt mae is a terror about things like this. and don't you dare tell her where we were tonight, either. she doesn't mind when you're with me, darling. she trusts me. she's not so bad. i guess i know her better than you do. janice! coming, aunt mae. take it easy, honey. everything's gonna be okay. i thought you'd be asleep. you haven't even been to bed. i'm sort of glad. oh, i had such a dreamy evening. i feel like talking. where were you tonight? you know. i was with stan. you like stan. we ran into a bunch of kids and we all drove out oh, it was just dreamy out there. and then we all drove back to mr. pierson's and had sodas. i was a pig. i had two. thank goodness it doesn't show. you're lying! you were at the wooly bear, that cheap road house. whatever you were drinking, it wasn't soda. who told you? mr. pierson phoned. he had something for me. he was closing up. he hadn't seen you all evening. that doesn't prove i was at the wooly bear either. no. i called there myself. why do you do these things? why do you lie? sometimes it's easier, i guess. what an awful thing to say. you ought to be ashamed you see i just told you the truth and you don't like that either. what do you want from me? i want you to be nice. nice! how corny can you get! janice, don't be fresh! i'm just being honest again. besides, i don't see what you're so upset about anyway. i didn't do anything really bad. i just wanted a little fun. and i was with stan. why don't you get angry at him? stan loves you. it's easy to do the wrong thing when you love someone. you've wrapped him around your finger the way you try but it won't work. you're my sister's child and i've got my responsibilities. i know. i know. i just don't understand you. i've tried. lord knows i've tried but you always want whatever you haven't got. i had everything i wanted once. everything shiny and beautiful and grand. not like this smelly house. not like you. i want to go back where i belong! janice, janice, this is where you belong. that other house, it wasn't yours. your mother and father were only servants there. they lived in the gardener's cottage. that's where you were born. that lady in the chiffon was not your mother. you know all this. why do you make up these stories? i remember such a beautiful party once. with flowers and silver dishes and candles. they invited me. they wanted me. what happened? why did everything have to change? they still wanted me! i know they did! it's your fault, you took me away! it's your fault, don't you see? stop! you're acting like a baby! i never heard of such nonsense. get up off that floor! you make me sick! janice! janice, come back here! this minute! do you hear? just where were you going, may i ask? i want the truth. back to the wooly bear if you must know. well, you're not. not tonight. not ever. i tried to love you. maybe i didn't find the right way. but it's still my job to see that you grow up properly. whether you like it or not! don't try anymore. let me go somewhere, anywhere, away from here. please. someday you can go anywhere you like. but right now you're going to bed! no. don't. why can't you leave me alone? just leave me alone! you waited for me this time. maybe. i'm glad. i'm very glad. i am too. i guess. pretty late for you to be out, isn't it janice? hi, matt. not necessarily. i just felt like a lemonade, that's all. i'll bet there's one sitting in your aunt mae's so, why don't you run along home where you belong? go on. shoo! and don't think i won't check up on you later. mighty pretty girl. mighty young too. you just passing through? maybe you better keep right on going. i waited for you this time. well, you shouldn't have. don't you like me? yeah. i like you. well, here we are. tex, take me with you, just as far as the next town. now, look... i won't be any trouble, honest. are you kidding? come on give ol' tex it's really been awfully sweet of you to walk me home and i do appreciate it and i had a wonderful time. i'm sorry i can't invite you in but aunt mae would be furious. she's asleep upstairs. you understand, don't you? well, couldn't i come in for just a minute? well, gee, honest i'd love to your aunt mae won't mind. come on, we'll be real quiet. well, if you promise not to make any noise. she's probably asleep. don't make a sound. can't see a thing. follow me and be quiet. in here. i like it in the dark better, baby. you don't have to whisper in here. aunt mae can't hear us. besides she wouldn't do anything to you. she sure must be a dilly, your aunt. you know what's the matter with her? she's good. she's so good she makes you sick. yeah, i know about people like that. they just kill you with kindness. and when your back's turned, they stick knives in it. i'm not like that. you know something? i don't know what you're like. you're funny. you're funny, too. maybe that's why i like you. maybe. it's a pretty nice place you got here. why're you so set on leaving? would you like to live here permanently? no. not any place. i like visiting. it's a lot safer. did you have a nice, kind family who stuck knives yeah. they weren't very kind about it. you don't look scared anymore, so i think i'll blow. come here, tex! this minute! this very minute! who do you think you're talking to? kneel down so i can look at you. is that what you make stan do? who cares about stan? i like you better. now, look, baby. don't fool with me. i'm not, tex. i like you. besides i'll get you a drink. you stay here. i thought i told you to stay out of here. i just wanted to help you. say, what's eating you anyway? you were going to leave! i know you were! you can't leave yet, don't you see? look, it's still a free country. but that policeman, he said he was coming by here what if he caught you leaving? well, so what? we're very well chaperoned. there's always your aunt mae upstairs. yes, of course. but... besides, you haven't had your drink yet. you know something, you really are a kid. help! help! oh, thank goodness. oh, it's horrible. what happened? who did this? he's inside. he would have killed me. he tried to. you wait here. now, look. now, look, wait a minute. get in there. what happened? how'd this happen? stay there. what happened? he followed me home. oh, i should have listened to aunt mae. he wouldn't go away. i was afraid he'd wake aunt mae. oh, no. so, i gave him some milk but then... but then he tried to kiss me and everything. no, that's not... oh, it was horrible. and then i screamed. no! and aunt mae came down. officer, that's not true. shut up. go on, janice. he killed her. i didn't do it, i swear it! look, you've got to listen to me! you've got to listen to me! she must have planned it this way. this is matt. i'm gonna need some help. i got a murder on my hands. why, you little... look, you can't do this! jan. oh, darling, where were you? i needed you so. i've been walking around. i didn't know what to do. you see, i came back. i wanted to tell you that i changed my mind. i wanted to take you away. but you were gone back to... to get him, i guess. she was lying there. where you left her. i didn't want to kill her. it's just that... she wouldn't leave me alone. well, she had me fooled. after all anyone who would bludgeon her elderly aunt and now while i'm briefly away i'd like to show you still another lethal weapon if used in large quantities one of these can bore a person to death. when the dosage is as limited as that there's no danger. after all a one minute commercial never hurt anyone. we have another play prepared to show you next week. i hope you'll join us then. good night."
0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"it's been a week since our return to ds9 but the celebration continues. we're still at war, and the station is now the hq of the ninth fleet. that, plus our position by the wormhole, makes ds9 one of the most tempting targets in the quadrant. but for now, at least, the war seems very far away. morning. good morning. - morning, major. - good morning, captain. how i missed hearing you say that. how i hated saying ""good morning, dukat"". i can imagine. what's on the agenda? u.s.s. potemkin has completed repairs and is rejoining the fleet later today. exeter, sutherland and agaki have submitted resupply requests and there are 1,000 messages from starfleet command awaiting ""your eyes only"" attention. anything else? - general martok is in your office. - i'll start with him. i thought you would. have i mentioned that it's good to be home? once or twice. - you knew about this, didn't you? - i had a pretty good idea. - and you did nothing to stop it. - no. in fact, i recommended you for the position. allow me to congratulate the new supreme commander of the ninth fleet. do you have any idea of the paperwork a supreme commander has to do? you're welcome. may i arrange quarters for you on the station? no, i'll keep my flag aboard the rotarran. it's cramped but at least i'll feel like i'm still at war. by the way, i'd like worf to continue as my intelligence officer. i don't see any problem with that. he's the only officer i know who can never get enough work. at least if he's busy he'll stop going on about this wedding of his. there were times on the rotarran he nearly drove me mad. until his son arrived, it was all he could talk about. then alexander was all he could talk about. the man is nothing if not single-minded. i haven't met worf's son yet. what's he like? he's a fine boy. dedicated, eager. he has the heart of his father but he's not the best soldier i've ever seen. when he ordered the system back on line, i thought he meant the hydrostatic system, so... you engaged the pumps with the check valves open? he did. i flooded the entire deck with hydraulic fluid. it took three days to clean it up. it still smells like burnt dog hair. remind me to keep you away from the defiant. the rotarran's crew thinks of me as a good luck charm. you know, the more mistakes i make, the safer they feel. i hope the ya'vang's crew does too. the ya'vang? i got new orders this morning. the battle cruiser ya'vang took heavy losses in their last engagement so most of the rotarran's crew are being transferred there, including me. - more bloodwine? - why not? no. not for me. handsome young man. he must get his looks from his mother. - what do you want? - have you reconsidered my offer? we are not getting married in this bar. the ceremony will take place on the klingon homeworld after the war. worf, let's do it here, this week, before alexander leaves. - perfect. i'll make the arrangements. - wait. i thought we had agreed. we did, but i'd hate alexander to miss his dad's wedding. it would mean so much to him. besides, it may be a long time before you see him again. what's going on? our wedding plans have changed. we are getting married here on deep space 9 and i would like you to be my tawi'yan. sword-bearer. it's sort of like a best man. me? really? oh, that's great! i'll put that on your tab. it doesn't leave much time but there isn't much left to do. worf's been planning the ceremony for three months. he has everything figured, even the colour of my shoes. no offence, but it seems like this wedding's all about what worf wants. habitat ring, section 51 gamma. what about you? a traditional klingon wedding is what worf's wanted since he was a boy. it probably has something to do with being raised by humans. regarding klingon tradition, worf is very sentimental. worf? all men are sentimental. they just cover it up with scowls and clenched jaws. there are times worf literally gets misty-eyed talking about klingon rituals. so that's why you're letting him plan the wedding? mostly, but the truth is i've been through five trill ceremonies and i'm a little bored with it. is it me or did odo just try and avoid us? i didn't notice. we've been avoiding each other since the dominion left. i think we're both afraid of talking about the occupation. what do you mean? to tell the truth, it's nothing i want to talk about right now either. thank you for coming. as you probably know, jadzia and i will be married here in six days. there's nothing so romantic as a wedding on ds9 in spring. with the neutrinos in bloom. by tradition, a klingon man spends four nights before his wedding on a mental and spiritual journey called kal'hyah, ""the path of clarity"", accompanied by his closest male friends. you cannot imagine the experience. four long nights filled with song and fellowship. a time of unbridled pleasures. are we talking about a bachelor party here? it is a similar ritual. - sounds good to me. - me too. count me in. we will meet in the holosuite tomorrow at 2100 hours. i advise you all to get plenty of rest. four nights at a klingon bachelor party. just think of it. - thank god keiko's not here. - i wonder what dax will be doing. she will be taking a different journey... with my wife. your wife? by marrying worf, dax will join the house of martok. since its mistress must approve all marriages, sirella will spend the next four days evaluating jadzia. my lady. you've put on weight and your hair is going grey. my deterioration is proceeding apace. i thought you would be in your grave by now. i shall endeavour to die this year, if possible. allow me to present captain benjamin sisko, commander of deep space 9. captain, may i present the mistress of the house of martok, my wife and the mother of my children, sirella, daughter of linkasa. welcome to deep space 9. thank you, captain. where is she? jadzia's quarters are in the habitat ring, section 25 alpha. shall i escort you? it's quite far away. i'll find my way. if you'll excuse me. magnificent, isn't she? are those real var'hama candles? yes, i travelled to kronos, captured three targs in the hamar mountains, sacrificed them at dawn, came back to the station, had quark boil their shoulders into tallow. then i spent two days moulding them into candles with my hands. - i was just asking. - you were criticising. again. relax. she's not going to reject a prospective daughter because her var'hama candles were replicated. come in. what is he doing here? - i meant no disrespect. - then leave. your worthiness to join our house will now be judged according to the traditions of my family. - i am prepared, my lady. - i doubt that. a klingon woman would find it difficult to gain my favour. for an alien it will most likely be impossible. i like a challenge. i will not have my authority challenged by you. that's not what i meant. if you cannot say what you mean, say nothing. the evaluation begins in the morning. have the traditional meal prepared before i arrive. and in the future, if you cannot trouble yourself to make real var'hama candles, try not to use such obvious fakes. you never told me your wife opposed my marriage. she is a woman of strong convictions. she believes that by bringing aliens into our families, we risk losing our identity. - that is a prejudiced, xenophobic view. - we are klingons, worf. we don't embrace other cultures, we conquer them. those who wish to join us must honour our traditions and prove themselves worthy of the crest of a great house. - jadzia is worthy. - of course she is. she's an honourable woman and a formidable warrior. you should say that to sirella. that's not a good idea. i don't want her to think i'm interfering in her domain. perhaps i should speak with her. coming from me, it would not seem like a challenge. i wouldn't do that if i were you. why? well, um... the truth is... she doesn't like you that much either. - me! - don't let that bother you. i had every right to bring you into the family and she's accepted that there's nothing she can do about it. how comforting. and they say that you have no sense of humour! i could do without the heat. can't say much for the decor either. well, it can't be all fun and games. there must be some sort of ritual we have to go through before the party. there is going to be a party, isn't there? you're asking me? i can barely say my name in klingon. prepare yourselves, my friends, for a journey you won't soon forget. these are ma'stakas. what uh... what do we do with them? at the end of the wedding ceremony you'll use them to attack worf and dax. don't you know anything? the tradition dates from kahless and lukara who were nearly killed by molor's troops moments after they were married. until the ceremony, keep these with you at all times. - i trust this combat is non-lethal. - it is a symbolic attack only. - that food is not to be eaten. - then what is it for? it is there to tempt us to break our fast. fast? there are six trials on the path to kal'hyah. this is the first, deprivation. we now begin a fast until the wedding. that's four days away. it is a short time i know, but we must make the best of it. - what are the other five trials? - blood, pain, sacrifice, anguish... ...and death. - sounds like marriage. - how do you know? it is time to begin. more flowers on the banister. we're ready with the banner. raise it! you're up early. i thought writers slept late. not always. i sold my first book today. - how much did you get for it? - it's just a figure of speech. the news service is publishing my stories about life under dominion rule. - and they're not paying you? - no. my sympathies. the first round of drinks is on the house. - really? - no. it's a figure of speech. i want to tell my dad. is he still in the holosuite? oh, yeah. they're still up there. - what are they doing? - it's a klingon bachelor party. you're a writer. use your imagination. alexander. grandma? guess again. - we're still on the...? - the road to kal'hyah, day 500. maybe we should turn down the heat, for alexander's sake. no, it's ok. ...i just need some water. you don't want to push yourself too hard. turning down the heat might be a good idea. the whole point is to push yourself to the limits of endurance. i will. i want to travel the entire path to kal'hyah. - stoke the fire again! - as you wish. of course, we cannot expect you non-klingons to have the same stamina as us. if you wish to quit, no one will think any less of you. - who said anything about quitting? - not me. - i like the heat. - that's the spirit. again. i've done it three times already. you continue to rush through the ceremony, your body position is poor, and the placement of the braziers on their pedestals is sloppy. - do you know how heavy they are? - a klingon woman would not complain. you wouldn't make a klingon woman do it three times. true. she'd have done it right first time. end this now, jadzia. go back to your own people. they will tolerate your weaknesses and your failings in a way that a klingon family never will. in our house, you would always be an alien, an outsider. at best, you'd be an object of pity but you'd never be accepted, never an equal, because you can never truly be one of us. the second dynasty ended when general k'trelan assassinated emperor reclaw. for the next ten years, the empire was ruled by a council elected by the people. modern-day klingon historians refer to this as ""the dark time."" but it's interesting that this first and only experiment in klingon democracy actually produced several reforms... - you are straying from the saga. - am i? your task is to recite the complete chronicle of the women in my family. i thought i'd give you a broader historical perspective. i am familiar with klingon history. now, return to the story of my 23rd maternal grandmother, shenara, daughter of emperor reclaw in the second dynasty. well, that's where we run into a little problem. you see, i did some research: when emperor reclaw was killed, all members of the imperial family were put to death, including shenara. when the third dynasty was founded ten years later, a new group took the titles and names of the original imperial family to create the illusion of an unbroken line. so the woman that you think of as your 23rd maternal grandmother isn't related to you at all. your real ancestor's name was karana, a concubine living outside the imperial stables. my grandmother's name was shenara. that may be what's been passed down but it has no basis in fact. but who cares about facts? the chronicle says you have imperial blood and that's what we'll keep telling everyone. - continue with the saga. - my pleasure. major, is it true dax is having a party? - news travels fast. - is it by invitation? i'm sure you're welcome. tell nog the same goes for him. i hear congratulations are in order to our newest published author. thank you. - what was that about? - nothing. there they go. they look so serious. it's an act. they don't want us to know what they're up to. like what? it's a klingon bachelor party. use your imagination. now begins the trial of blood. let rivers flow from our veins. who will be first? i did not expect it to be you, doctor. - neither did i. - do not worry. the pain will last for only a moment. isn't that great? all right! he's unbelievable. lieutenant manuele atoa from the starship sutherland. - i've never seen anything like that. - neither have i. let's get something to eat. a woman of many talents. shame she's about to waste them all on that walking frown she calls a fiancé. she's too good for him. i always said so. are you jealous? - there's no profit in jealousy. - that's not a denial. - it's not to be quoted. - don't worry. so, when did you first realise you had these feelings for dax? wait... - miles? - yeah? it's working. i've had a vision about the future. i can see it so clearly. what is it? i'm going to kill worf. i'm going to kill worf. that's what i'm going to do. i can see it clearly now. i'm going to kill him. kill worf. kill worf. kill worf. i've been getting complaints about the noise. someone mentioned a fight. there was a scuffle between morn and a bolian but they worked it out. how long will this... party continue? this party will continue until further notice on the personal authority of the first officer, who happens to be me. - you're in a good mood. - well, it's a good party. - well... - odo... odo... i think we have a lot to talk about. - i agree. - so let's talk. - now? - haven't we put it off long enough? enjoy yourselves. let's find someplace a little quieter. yahoo! thanks for the show. - thanks for getting me a day off. - captain shelby owed me a favour. actually, he owed me several. how would you like to have another two days off? two? what do i have to do? just give me something fun to look at for the rest of the evening. - anything else? - i'll let you know. you! leave her or i'll cut your head off and hang it from my belt. i'll take care of this. - you weren't invited. - it is time for the bre'nan ritual. - i'm busy. - busy acting like a risian slut. i'll only ask you to leave once. you will come with me and perform the bre'nan ritual to my satisfaction or i will cancel your wedding. ladies, please. why is everyone standing around? the party's just getting started. play something! double raktajino, extra sweet. - what time is it? - 10:30 hours. come on. wrong door. excuse me, sir. jadzia we need to... - you're mad. - i am concerned. yeah, well, i'm hung over. can we talk later? we have a very serious problem. sirella has cancelled the wedding. she doesn't waste time, does she? she said you attacked her. she pulled a knife. you are forbidden to join the house of martok. so i won't be invited to the family picnics. i'll live. i cannot believe you're taking this so lightly. - do you hear that? - what? it sounds like voices. - hi. - hi. - is the party over? - you could say that. it's 10:30. - in the morning? i'm on duty. - so am i. - it was a great party. - thanks. - we must deal with the situation now. - stop yelling. my head hurts. go to sirella and beg her forgiveness. i don't beg. - you're allowing your pride to blind you. - look who's talking. you want me to crawl just so you can have your traditional wedding. this is about more than just tradition. we have embarked on a spiritual journey that will bind us together through this life and the next. you can't turn back. maybe you're on a spiritual journey, but i just want to get married. so why don't you go back to sweating and bleeding with your friends and when you're done, meet me in benjamin's office and he'll perform the ceremony. if that is your attitude... ...perhaps sirella was right about you. there should be no wedding. that's fine with me. - what's going on? - the wedding's off. off? why? she says it's because he's a pig-headed, stubborn man who puts tradition before everything. he says it's because she's a frivolous emotional woman who refuses to take him or his culture seriously. - you see the problem. - they're both right. exactly. well, there's only one thing for it. dinner. i'll get the menu. enter. worf... you've made a grave error. perhaps. - do you still love her? - of course. however, in this case, that may not be enough. anyone can see we are hopelessly mismatched. she is a trill, i am a klingon. she has had five marriages. this would be my first. when she is laughing, i am sombre. when i am happy, she is crying. she plays tongo with the ferengi bartender. i can barely stand him. she mocks everything... ...while i take everything seriously. she is nothing like the woman i thought i would marry. we are not accorded the luxury of choosing who we fall in love with. do you think sirella is anything like the woman i thought i'd marry? she is a prideful, arrogant, mercurial woman who shares my bed far too infrequently for my taste. and yet... ...i love her deeply. we klingons often tout our prowess in battle, our desire for glory and honour above all else. but how hollow is the sound of victory without someone to share it with? honour gives little comfort to a man alone in his home... ...and in his heart. one steak with mushrooms, baked potato and sour cream. i should've had that. one double altair sandwich, no mustard, two bowls of linguini, bajoran shrimp with extra cheese. one loaf of mapa bread. - and the kava juice? - they're squeezing it. - unless you want replicated. - we'll wait. what do you think you're doing? - the wedding's off. - it's back on. worf is apologising to jadzia at this very moment. quark, take it all away. no food for those on the path to kal'hyah. no refunds for those on the path to kal'hyah as well. sorry. father, what happened? she refused to change her mind. the wedding is still off. - where is she? - in her quarters. i'll go talk to her. just.. keep them away from the food. come in! save your breath. worf's gone too far. now it's over. he wanted me to go crawling on my hands and knees to sirella to beg her forgiveness. beg her! me! i was once the federation ambassador to the klingon empire. i negotiated the khitomer accords before worf was born. curzon negotiated the accords! i've got news for you: you're not curzon anymore. what the hell does that mean? you can't expect to be treated like him just because you carry his memories. to her, you're just a young woman marrying into her family. if it means you have to kiss her boots, that's what you have to do, and you knew that. the moment you chose to marry worf you knew sooner or later you'd have to show her the respect she's due. this is worf's fault. worf and his traditional klingon wedding. he may have let this wedding go to his head, but you are 356 years old. compared to you, worf is just a kid. if you can't abide by klingon traditions, you never should have let yourself fall in love with him in the first place. and you are in love with him. i wasn't looking to fall in love. i was perfectly happy by myself. i had friends, a career, adventure... then one day, this klingon with a bad attitude walked into my life and the next thing i know, i'm getting married. after 356 years and seven lifetimes... ...i still lead with my heart. you know, that is what i've always loved about you. i think that's why worf loves you too. whatever happened to that young, callow ensign i used to know? the one who used to turn to me for advice all the time? you know, the one with hair? i grew up. i guess it's time i grow up, too. with fire and steel did the gods forge the klingon heart. so fiercely did it beat, so loud was the sound, that the gods cried out, ""on this day we have brought forth ""the strongest heart in all the heavens. ""none can stand before it without trembling at its strength.” but the klingon heart weakened, its steady rhythm faltered and the gods said, ""why have you weakened so? ""we have made you the strongest in all of creation.” - and the heart said... - ""i am alone."" and the gods knew they had erred. so they went back to their forge and brought forth... another heart. but the second heart beat stronger than the first and the first was jealous of its power. fortunately, the second heart was tempered by wisdom. ""if we join together, no force can stop us."" and when the two hearts began to beat together, they filled the heavens with a terrible sound. for the first time, the gods knew fear. they tried to flee, but it was too late. the klingon hearts destroyed the gods who created them and turned the heavens to ashes. to this very day, no one can oppose the beating of two klingon hearts. not even me. worf, son of mogh, does your heart beat only for this woman? yes. will you swear to join with her and stand with her against all who oppose you? i swear. jadzia, daughter of kela, does your heart beat only for this man? yes. do you swear to join with him and stand with him against all who would oppose you? i swear. then let all present know that this man and this woman are married. - now? - not yet. - now? - patience. my lady. welcome to the house of martok... ...my daughter. now, doctor!"

- fine, fine. i'll have a reception committee there to meet you. good, i'll be looking forward to it. kirk out. - scotty, you have the com. - aye, sir. spock, mccoy, we're beaming down. standard equipment. the horizon's contact came before the non-interference directive went into effect. they must have interfered with the normal evolution of the planet. it will be interesting to see the results of the contamination. we don't know there is contamination. the evidence is only circumstantial. well, what was the state of the lotian culture before the horizon came? the beginnings of industrialisation. horizon reports indicate the lotians are extremely intelligent and somewhat imitative. so we're going down to recontaminate them. if the damage has been done, doctor, we are here to repair it. let's not argue about it, let's go study it. energize. - fascinating. - this is like coming home. home was never like this. i've seen pictures of the old days that looked like this. interesting, captain. passers-by are carrying, i believe, firearms. okay, you three, let's see you petrify. sir, would you mind explaining that statement, please? i wanna see you turn to stone. put your hands over your head, or you ain't gonna have no head to put your hands over. space, the final frontier. these are the voyages of the starship enterprise. its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. what's this? that's a weapon. be careful with that. a heater, huh? hey, the boss will love that. now, look, we were asked to come down here by a mr. oxmyx. - he said... - i know what he said, bud. he said some of the boys would meet you. - okay, we're meeting you. - those firearms are not necessary. - you trying to make trouble? - who, me? don't give me those baby blue eyes. - what? - i don't go for that innocent routine. sir, does everyone here carry firearms? i never heard such stupid questions in my life. well, since this oxmyx asked us down here, - don't you think we should see him? - all right, get moving. down the street. krako's getting more gall all the time. - is this how you greet all your guests? - it happens, pal. - that man's dead back there. - well, we ain't playing for peanuts. what's the matter, you guys never saw a hit before? sir, there are several questions i would like to ask. ask the boss. i don't know nothing. get moving. that's the contamination you're looking for. yes, but the horizon crew wasn't composed of cold-blooded killers, and they didn't report this culture in this state either. what happened? hey, kalo. hey, when's the boss gonna do something about the crummy streetlights around here, huh? a girl ain't safe. yeah, and how about the laundry pickup? we ain't had a truck by in three weeks. - write him a letter. - i did. he sent it back with postage due. listen, we pay our percentages. we're entitled to a little service for our money, huh? get lost, will you? some people got nothing to do but complain. is this the way your citizens do business? their right of petition? they pay their percentages, and the boss takes care of them. hit that button. - yeah? - got them, boss. no sweat. all right, bring them in. which one of you guys is the captain? it depends. make yourself a drink, captain. it's good stuff. i distill it myself. - no, thank you. you're mr. oxmyx? - that's me, pal. this is my first officer, mr. spock, dr. mccoy. doctor, huh? put the chopper down, kalo. these guys are our guests. pick up a cue, captain. go ahead. you gotta excuse my boys. can't be too careful around here these days. yes. judging from what we've seen so far, i agree. they call you the boss, mr. oxmyx. the boss of what? the boss of my territory. i got the biggest in the world. you know, there's one thing wrong with having the biggest. there's always some punk trying to cut you out. that's why you can't be too careful. - you're the government here? - what government? like i told you, i got the territory and i run it, that's all. but there are other bosses, other territories? yeah, sure. maybe a dozen or so. not counting the small fry. but then they get burned anyway, as soon as i get around to it. does that include, if i may ask, a gentleman called krako? - how do you know about krako? - he hit us, boss. okay. you hit him back, you hear? hard. i'll take care of it. captain? doctor? - gangsters. - chicago mobs. published in 1992. - where'd you get this? - hey, hey, wait a minute. - that's the book. - i know it's a book. the book. they left it. the other ship, the horizon. this is the contamination, captain. astonishing. an entire culture based on this. you said they were imitative and the book... - no more cracks about the book. - did they leave any other books? yeah, sure. some textbooks on how to make radio sets and stuff like that but... look, i brought you down here so you could help me, not for you to ask me questions. after that, i'll answer anything you wanna know. what is it you want? well, i was thinking. you feds must have made a lot of improvements since that other ship came here. you probably got all kinds of fancy heaters up there. so here's the deal. you give me all the heaters i need, enough tools so i can knock off all those punks all at once. then i'll take over, and all you have to do - is deal with me. - let me get this straight. you want us to supply you with arms and assistance so you can carry out an aggression against your neighbours? what aggression? i gotta make some hits. i want you to help me hit them, that's all. fascinating, but quite impossible. mr. oxmyx, my orders are quite explicit. under no... i ain't interested in your orders. from now on, you're gonna take orders from me. i'm gonna give you just eight hours to give me the things i want. if i don't have those tools by then, i'm gonna call up your ship and have them pick you up... ...in a box. is that understood, pal? hey, boss. this here's a heater, and i don't know what this is. - well, let's see how this thing works. - don't do that. you could knock out the side of the building. that good, huh? all you have to do is give me about 100 of these fancy heaters, and we'll have no more trouble. out of the question. captain kirk, i usually get what i want. what's this thing? - all right, burn them! - now, hold it. it's a communication device. how does it work? it's locked onto my ship's system... kalo, take them to the warehouse and put them in the bag. - keep a sharp eye on them, you hear? - in the bag, boss. come on. hey, you. in the ship up there. - hey, you in the ship. - scott here. who's this? this is bela oxmyx. i got your captain and his friends down here. you wanna see them alive, you'll send me down a hundred of these fancy heaters you got, and some troops to show me how to use them. am i to understand that you're holding the captain and his party? you heard right, pal. i'm gonna give you just eight hours to get me the goods i want, or i put the hit on your friends. you understand? i don't know. lieutenant hadley, check the language banks and find out what a... heater is. one book on the gangs of chicago did all this. - it's amazing. - they evidently seized upon that one book as the blueprint for an entire society. - as the bible. - in old chicago, conventional government almost broke down. the gangs nearly took over. yeah, well, this oxmyx is the worst gangster of all. we may quarrel with mr. oxmyx's methods, but his goal is essentially the correct one. this society must become united or it will degenerate into total anarchy. if this society broke down as a result of the horizon's influence, then the federation is responsible, and we've got to do something to straighten this mess out. spock, if you could get to the sociological computers, do you think you could find a solution? unfortunately, i do not have access to my computers, nor are these gentlemen likely to permit it. yeah. well, i've got an idea about that. gentlemen, gentlemen... this... this card game is a kid's game. - you think so, huh? - oh, yes, yes. - i wouldn't waste my time. - who's asking you? on beta antares iv, they play a real game. it's a man's game, but of course, probably a little beyond you. it requires intelligence. listen, kirk, i can play anything you can figure out. take the cards, big man. - show us how it's played. - captain, i am familiar with the culture on beta antares iv. - spock. spock. - i don't know of any game... of course, the cards on beta antares iv are different, but not too different. - name of the game is called fizzbin. - fizzbin? fizzbin. it's not too difficult. each player gets six cards, except for the dealer, the player on the dealer's right who gets seven. - on the right? - yes. the second card is turned up, except on tuesday. on tuesday. oh, look what you got, two jacks. you got a half-fizzbin already. - i need another jack. - no, no, if you got another jack, - why, you'd have a shralk. - a shralk? yes, you'd be disqualified. no, what you need now is either a king and a deuce, except at night, of course, when you'd need a queen and a four. - except at night. - right. oh, look at that. you got another jack! how lucky you are! how wonderful for you! now, if you didn't get another jack, if you had gotten a king, why, then you'd get another card, except when it's dark, - when you'd have to give it back. - if it were dark on tuesday? yes, but what you're after is a royal fizzbin, but the odds in getting a royal fizzbin are astron... spock, what are the odds in getting a royal fizzbin? i've never computed them, captain. well, they're astronomical, believe me. astronomical. now, for the last card, we'll call it a kronk. - you got that? - what? i'll get it. spock, find the radio station. uhura is monitoring the broadcasts. cut in and have yourselves beamed up to the ship. - surely you're coming? - i will, - but i'm bringing bela oxmyx. - jim, you can't... bones, this mess is our responsibility. you have your orders. let's go. hold it! - okay, pally, we're going for a ride. - if you don't mind, i'd rather walk. listen, pally, this could either be a taxi or a hearse. you know what i mean? i'm beginning to get the idea. you do that very well. now, how are you with primitive radio equipment? very simple. amplitude modulation transmission. i simply adjust the frequency, throw this switch, and the enterprise should answer. that was the jailbreakers with their latest recording on request time, brought to you by bang-bang, the makers of the sweetest little automatic in the worl... - fascinating. - and very simple. well, let me see. enterprise, this is mr. spock. lieutenant uhura here, mr. spock. mr. spock, what are you doing on this frequency? a very long and complicated story, lieutenant. notify the transporter room. two to beam up, these coordinates. so you're the fed, huh? - well, well, well. - and you? krako. jojo krako. i'm the head of the whole southside territory. hey, i'm glad to see you. would you mind telling me how you even know who i am? sit down, kirk. i've got all of bela's communications bugged. he can't make a date with a broad unless i know about it. well, i guess you wanna know why i brought you here. you wanna make a deal. hey, i like that. that is sharp. - that's sharp, eh, zabo? - sharp, boss. that's right, a deal. i want you to help me. let me guess. you want... you want heaters, and then you'll want troops to teach them how to use them. and then you'll attack the other bosses and take over the whole planet. - then we'll sit down and talk, right? - wrong! i know bela. he didn't offer you beans. now, me, i'm a reasonable man. you give me what i want, and i'll cut you in for, say, a third. skimmed right off the top. well, what do you think? i got a better idea. this planet has to be united. now, you know that, bela knows that. let's sit down. you, me, bela. discuss this whole matter, contact the other bosses, and talk about it like reasonable men. you watch it, kirk. the book tells us how to handle things. you make hits. somebody argues, you lean on him. you think we're stupid or something? no, no, no, i don't think you're stupid, mr. krako, i just think your behaviour is arrested. i've never been arrested in my whole life! now, listen, pally, i know how to get what i want. you wanna live, don't you, kirk? you bet you do, but after i get through with you, you're liable to be sorry unless you come across. hold him here. tell cirl the knife to sharpen up his blade. i just might have a job for him. unless you come across with the heaters. i'm sorry, krako. no deal. that's too bad. put him on ice. - well? - futile, doctor. no specifics. there is no record of such a culture based on a moral inversion. - you mean you're giving up? - no, doctor. i'm merely saying the computers can offer us no logical, rational, factual way - out of our current dilemma. - mr. spock. mr. oxmyx is making contact from the surface. on audio, lieutenant. mr. oxmyx, this is mr. spock. hey, how'd you get back up there? - irrelevant, since we are here. - oh, yeah. i tell you, you better come on back down. krako's put the bag on your captain. why would he put a bag on our captain? kidnapped him, you dope. - he'll scrag him too. - if i understand you correctly, that would seem to be a problem. look, you guys got something i want. i can help you get your captain back. then we can talk about the deal i want. i'm afraid i find it difficult to trust you, mr. oxmyx. what's to trust? business is business. we'll call a truce. you come on down. my boys will spring kirk, and then we'll talk about giving me a hand. you will show no further hostility? i'm a businessman, pally. what do you say? since we must have our captain back, i accept. we shall arrive in your office within ten minutes. spock out. you mean you're gonna trust him? if we are to save the captain without blatant, forceful interference on this planet, doctor, we must have the assistance of someone indigenous. we are therefore forced to trust mr. oxmyx. help me! help! help me! help! mr. scott, though we hope to avoid interference, i suggest you set one of our phaser banks on a strong stun position. aye, sir. now you're beginning to make sense. i trust we shall not have to use them, but it is best to be prepared. energize. - you know what to do. - don't worry, boss. they can't do nothing till they're through sparkling. just the same, you be careful. they'll have heaters on them. now, you watch this. ship's log, mr. spock reporting. incredible as it seems, dr. mccoy and i are once again prisoners of the chief criminal boss of a society patterned after old earth gangsters. pick up many more of these, i won't need your cooperation. mr. oxmyx, i understood we had an arrangement, a truce. i was hoping you'd think that, dummy. we're trying to help you, oxmyx. nobody helps nobody but himself. sir, you are employing a double negative. i fail to see why you do not understand us. you yourself have stated the need for unity of authority on this planet. - we agree. - yeah, but i gotta be the unity. cooperation, sir, would inevitably result... the most cooperative man in this world is a dead man. and if you don't keep your mouth shut, you're gonna be cooperating. drop the guns. drop them. move down there. hey, captain, you got away from krako. you know, that ain't easy. you were supposed to report to the ship. we did, captain. the situation required our return. it may be just as well. - find out anything from the computer? - nothing useful. logic and practical information do not seem to apply here. you admit that? to deny the facts would be illogical, doctor. then you don't mind if i play a hunch? i'm not sanguine about hunches, captain, but i have no practical alternative. what are we gonna do now, jim? well, now that we have bela, i'm gonna put the bag on krako. now, listen, you... say, that's nice material. - it ought to be. it cost a bundle. - get out of them. - hey! - i said... - just a minute. - you too! get out of the clothes. nobody's gonna put the bag on me anymore. wheels, mr. spock. a fliver, captain. key in the ignition, turn the ignition on... and nothing happens. where's the starter? there's the starter. yeah. interesting. - gears. - yes, gears. oh, i believe they had a device known as a... a clutch. a clutch, captain. perhaps one of those pedals on the floor. i kind of like this. i may get one myself. captain, you are an excellent starship commander, but as a taxi driver, you leave much to be desired. it was that bad? now, that could be a bit of a problem. if they were inside where they wouldn't be seen, we could stun them with our phasers, but not out here. if we can get close enough to them, we should be able to render them harmless with a reasonable rapidity. they don't look like the trusting type. - it's a hit, ain't it? - i beg your pardon. you're gonna hit somebody. can i watch? - young man, run along and play. - where'd you get them ears? - young man... - you gonna hit krako? out here? you open up and you'll be scragged from every window on the street. i can fix it for you. young man, this is likely to be quite hazardous. - if i were you... - hold on, spock. - out of the mouths of babes... - who are you calling a babe? - i'm calling you a babe. - calling me a babe? yeah, i'm calling... i'm calling you a babe, but there's nothing personal. sit down. you know a way we could get close to them? - sure. - how? - what's in it for me? - what do you want? a piece of the action. you do not even know what the action is going to be. i figure it's gotta be a thick percentage, - or you wouldn't be trying to hit krako. - logical. all right, young man, we'll guarantee you a piece of the action if we can pull this thing off. - is that a contract? - done. - what do we do? - you'll know what to do. and that! and how do you like that? and that! think you can gang up on me, huh? what are you, chicken? come on, why don't you gang up on me? i'll cut off your head and throw it in your face! now, take that and that! and that! and how do you like that and..? daddy, daddy, i hurt myself. - daddy, daddy, i hurt myself. - that's it. let's go. what's the matter? hurt yourself? - i want my daddy. - cute kid, ain't he? - sure is. - daddy! - i want my daddy! - sonny! - i want my dad. - sonny. - what's the matter? - wait. what have they done? what have they done to you? what have you done? a piece of the action. no one can see. put your phaser on stun. well, ain't this nice? i was wondering how i was gonna get you back, and here you deliver yourself. who's your friend with the ears, kirk? i think you've got it reversed, mr. krako. i ain't, pally. put down your heaters. captain, i believe that perhaps it would be wise to do as he says. i just heard the sound of... the sound of a machine-gun bolt being pulled back. mr. krako, i don't... so this is the fancy heater, huh? - how does it work? - i'm trying to tell you, mr. krako, that this is bigger than you, oxmyx or anyone. the only thing i want you to tell me is how it works. well, can you trust all your men? of course i can. well, one of these could make a man a pretty big boss, you know. i either trust them or they're dead. let's go in here and talk about it. now we got no busy little eyes to worry about. how does this work? all right, krako, we don't have time to show you how to play with toys. toys? what do you think we're here for, to get a cut of your deal? forget it. that's... peanuts to an outfit like the federation, right? unquestionably. - right? - right. now, look, krako, we're taking over the whole ball of wax. and you cooperate with us, and maybe we'll cut you in for a piece of the action. a minuscule... a very small piece. - how much is that? - that's... we'll figure it out later. i thought you guys had laws. no interference. who's interfering? we're taking over. - check? - right. the planet is being taken over by the federation, but we don't wanna come in here and use our muscle. you know what i mean? that ain't subtle. so, what we do is we... we help one guy take over the planet. he pulls the strings, and then we pull his. hey, you, sit down. - what's your cut? - what do you care, as long as you're being cut in? of course, there's always bela oxmyx. all right, it's a deal. call your ship, bring down your boys and whatever else you need. - kirk to enterprise. - enterprise. scott here. all right, scotty, we made a deal with krako. - we did, sir? - yeah, we're ready to make the hit. we're taking over the whole planet as soon as you get ready. do you think that's wise, sir? sure, we can trust krako, but we don't have any choice. you know what i mean? he's standing about 12 feet in front of me, all ready to be our pal. of course, scotty, i'd like to show him the ship, just to show him that we're... we're on the level, but you know how it is. aye. i know, indeed. scotty, we'll need phasers to equip every one of krako's men. we'll need advisors and troops to back him up on the hit. - you got all that, scotty? - aye, captain. captain, we're preparing everything. it'll be ready when you give the word. you may begin, mr. scott. acknowledged, captain. you mean you're gonna start sending down your boys now? not exactly. - right? - check. how..? how'd i get here? what..? what happened? you, you must be that scott fellow that kirk was talking to. i wanna know what happened! it looks like we put the bag on you, doesn't it? - i got rights! - you got nothing. you mind your place, mister, or you'll... you'll be wearing concrete galoshes. you mean cement overshoes? aye. - must we? - it's faster than walking. - but not as safe. - are you afraid of cars? not at all, captain. it's your driving that alarms me. spock, i've got the hang of it by now. go on. oh, not again. hey, wake up. you all right? hey, you guys, come in here! the feds snatched krako. i never seen anything like it. they're gonna move in unless we stop them now. yeah? how? bela's mixed up in this somehow. i got a sneaking hunch they're gonna hightail it back to his territory. and you know what we're gonna do? we're gonna hit his place. where are they? knowing krako, he'll probably send them back on a blotter. wrong again, oxmyx. - jim. - knock it off, sawbones. i wanna talk to this creep. now, listen, i'm getting tired of playing patty cake with you penny-ante operators. what do you mean, a penny-ante operator? you're a penny-ante operator. sit down. all right, spocko, cover him. listen, sweetheart, the federation's moving in. we're taking over. you play ball, we'll cut you in for a piece. if you don't, you're out. all the way out. do you know what i mean? yeah. sure. why didn't you say so in the first place? all you had to do was explain it to me. kirk to enterprise. enterprise. scott here, sir. - you got krako on ice? - aye, he's here. mad enough to chew neutronium, but behaving himself. okay, baby, cool him until i flag you. flag me? keep him there until i send for him. we're gonna make some old-style phone calls from this locale, so you locate the man on the other end of the blower - and give him a ride to his flop. - what? find the man at the other end of the phone, and transport him to these coordinates. can do, sweetheart? can do, captain. - standing by. - now, you. get on the blower and call the other bosses. i sure don't know what you think you're talking about. get with it. i'm giving the orders here. hello. hello? - scotty. - scott here. - guess who. - lock in and energize. yeah, you bet your life i've got a lot of nerve. what are you gonna do about it? i'm coming over there with a couple of my boys and we... mother... - hey, captain, that ain't bad. - yeah. i would advise youse to keep dialling, oxmyx. all right, you know what to do. we hit bela's place and nobody comes out alive. all right, let's go! all right. all right. all right! all right! now, the federation's taking over whether you like it or not. you people, you've been running this planet like a piecework factory. from now on, it's gonna be under one roof. you're gonna run it like a... like a business. and that means, you're gonna make a profit. yeah. and what's your percentage? i'm cutting the federation in for 40 percent. - you got any objections? - yeah. i hear a lot of talk, but all i see here is you and a couple of your boys. i don't see no federation. listen, they got a ship. i know, i was there. wait a minute. wait a minute. - tepo's got a point. all we see is them. - right. what? couple of your boys? i'm not gonna believe my eyes... hang on a minute, hang on a minute. quiet! just a moment. let me say something. i only saw three guys on that ship. maybe there ain't no more. there are over 400 guys there. that's your story, buster. hey, that's my boys, they're making a hit on this place. - my boys will put you down. - wanna bet? keep moving. one move out of you two guys and i'll drill him. give me the hardware. hey, that's great, krako. now we got hostages again. we can make a deal with the feds. are you kidding? this one's all mine. from now on, nobody's going no place. i'm gonna be the big boss in this here territory. now, wait a minute, wait a minute. get that heater down. don't you wanna take a look at what you're gonna fight? i already seen it. you're nothing, fed. all right, but at least let me call my ship one last time - and say goodbye. - well, all right. go ahead. don't get smart. hello, scotty, this is kirk. enterprise. scott here, sir. scotty, put the ship's phasers on stun. fire out bursts in a one-block radius around these coordinates. right away, sir. scott out. gee, that's some trick. - hey, did you see that? - they're not dead, just knocked out for a while. but they might just as well have been that way if we wanted them to. okay, okay, kirk. so we get the message. now, what was this syndicate deal you were talking about? he... he was talking about a percentage. - i was talking about both. - okay. a syndicate makes sense to me. i'm a peaceful man at heart, but i'm sick and tired of all these hits. i hit krako. krako hits tepo. tepo hits me. there's too many bosses. we can't get anything done. i was thinking, if there was just one, maybe somebody like you as the top boss, then we can get things done. hey, bela. no, no, no. the federation can't get connected with a small-time operation like this. no, i was thinking, bela, you would be the top boss. krako, you'd be his lieutenant. i don't want any trouble from the rest of you, because you'll have to answer to the federation. we'll be back every year to collect our cut. hey, look, you figure maybe 40 percent's enough? yeah, i think 40 percent's sufficient. it's reasonable. it sounds reasonable. that sound reasonable to you? it's reasonable, mr. oxmyx. let's break out some of your drinking stuff and celebrate the syndicate. gentlemen, you two have been brooding - ever since we returned to the ship. - brooding, captain? brooding, mr. spock. a sombre emotional state. now, do you wish to continue it or are you going to discuss it? captain, i am neither brooding nor sombre. but i do have reservations about your solution to the problem of the lotians. yes. i understand that. you don't think it's logical to leave a criminal organisation in charge. highly irregular, to say the least, captain. i'm also curious as to how you propose to explain to starfleet command that a starship will be sent each year to collect our cut. yes, that's a very good question, mr. spock. i propose that our cut be put into the planetary treasury and used to guide the lotians into a more ethical system. despite themselves, they'll be forced to accept conventional responsibilities. isn't that logical? all right, bones, in the language of the planet, what's your beef? well, i don't know how serious this is, jim, and i don't quite know how to tell you. well, go ahead. - but in all the confusion, l... - go ahead, tell me. - i think i left it in bela's office. - you left it?

(laughs) you actually start obsessing over the tiniest little details, like the thickness of the wedding invitation paper because, i mean, god knows you need something to fucking talk about! so, everybody, this is helen. helen, jonas. - hi. - hi. and everyone! (all) - hi! - help yourself. jonas was just explaining why relationships are a sham. are they? shit! they're like going to the theatre, ok? you pay loads to go and ultimately you are wasting your entire night, so, when someone asks you, ""did you have a good time?"", you both say, ""yeah! yeah, it was great."" the problem is the more that you pay and the longer it goes on, the more you're, ""oh, yeah, we loved it!"", you know, ""we love being together and never fucking anyone else"" ""and only just having one other person"" ""to share our real thoughts with for our entire lives, yeah, it's great!"" would you say you loved her, though? i just think we just really fancied each other and that was what it was. you know what it's like early on. you know, we were just, i don't know, we were just two tools in the tool shed that just fit together really fucking well. i mean, still, by the end, i'd be like, ""go on, honey, you go up,"" ""i'm just going to watch a little bit more of the news"" and i'd find myself, you know, watching redos of, like, hot times in earlier relationships! easy! i'm just saying, there's a beautiful woman upstairs, you know, waiting to have sex with me. what, right now? (they laugh) she's upstairs, you know, waiting to have sex with me and i'm sat downstairs watching redos of, like, some hot times with some hot girl that i just picked up in some place and i'm fucking pulling myself off. i mean, seriously? oh, come on... come on, guys. i mean, we all scroll through the grain rifling through our greatest hits for a little bit of filth now and then, surely? not me. helen doesn't have a grain! - oh, wow! - wow! no shit! was that a political thing? no, no, i was gouged about 12 months ago. jesus, was that painful? total agony. but on the plus of that, i don't remember it that clearly. there's a scar on here. yeah, can i, er...? yeah, that feels quite nice. yeah, that feels quite nice. (they chuckle) yeah, no brain damage, clearly! well, my sight held on fine, so... so, who took it then? stolen to order, as far as they could tell, probably to some millionaire chinese perve. really?! yeah. is that for real? yeah, and none of it was encrypted, so... so, they saw the lot! the thing is, after i was gouged i didn't have one for a few days and then just kind of, liked it. it's cool. that's cool. i mean, because more people are... i mean, now, right? like, going grainless? i believe it's huge with hookers. i mean, no offence! (they laugh) no, no, it's ok. sure, i... well, i'm pretty boring. one man is a time. boo! serial monogamist. i'm a serial monogamist. i'm staying faithful to my cornflakes right now! (laughs) well, i think it's an interesting choice, going grainless. it's a brave choice. i'm sorry, but i... i couldn't do it. uh-huh. ok, i was going to play some redos from the fraser o days. (all) yay! stuff from last night, depressing and fun. you know half the organic memories you have a junk, just not trustworthy. colleen works in grain development. with half the population you can implant false memories, just by asking leading questions in therapy. you can make people remember getting lost in shopping malls they never visited, getting bothered by paedophile babysitters they never had. i'm just happier now. tape rewinding 'ok, great, liam, this has been, this has been really great, erm...

'wow, it's only, it's early to call it a night.' 'do fancy a quick one down the pub?' 'oh, we've got to get back, 'rescue jodie from the paedophile babysitter! '(laughs)' 'yeah.' 'but why don't you come back to ours, for a nightcap if you want?' see? it was obvious i didn't want him to come, i was being polite to a moron. if you really don't want to come, you can get rid of him. hey, hey! hey. well, actually, what time is it? it's midnight. shit, it's quite late, time's gone on.

'i'm imagining a chillum and a big knob.' '(laughs) no, it was like dormouse.' 'big deal, big heart-breaker?' 'no, it was just a week.

- it's a horga'hn. a risian fertility symbol. displaying one to the locals indicates you're seeking jamaharon. - what's jamaharon? - i'll show you later. look. they like each other. i think i'm going to be sick. all right. i'm going. me too. - going? where? - i'm going to change. you don't think i'm going to beam down to risa dressed like this, do you? that's a good idea. when in rome... i can't believe we finally made it! - well, enjoy your vacation. - hm. we will. time to test these babies out. ladies... - you seek jamaharon? - i seek whatever you've got. all that is ours is yours. i'll take it. aren't you uncomfortable in uniform? starfleet uniforms are designed for comfort even in extreme environments. you look out of place. i mean, look around you. isn't it beautiful? it is an artificial paradise maintained by an elaborate weather control system. in its natural state, risa is a rain-soaked, unstable jungle. maybe so but the only dark cloud i see around here is you. - i'm not here to admire the scenery. - if you say so. - i guess we should just go home. - well, maybe... - i would not be so hasty. - the scenery has improved? a few months ago i was commanding the defiant on a scouting mission. we encountered a protostar cluster, a swirling mass of colour set against a background of glowing clouds and burning sky. it was the most beautiful thing i'd ever seen. until now. i've got to take you on vacation more often. dax, is that you? arandis, i was wondering if you were still here. i have even been promoted. i'm chief facilitator for the temtibi lagoon. - worf, this is arandis. - a friend of curzon's. she and curzon spent a lot of time together on his last trip here. we had a wonderful time... until i killed him. killed him? death by jamaharon. i suppose there are worse ways to go. trust me, he died happy. - he was such a sweet old man. - i'll take your word for it. it's so good to see you again, dax. your new host is very attractive. i'd like to think so. you haven't aged a day. risa's been very kind to me. - let me show you around. - maybe later. of course. - all that is ours is yours. - thanks. we have everything we need. - that wasn't very nice. - why? - is there something of hers you want? - arandis was curzon's lover, not mine. - i hope you remember that. - you're angry about captain boday. if i am angry, it is because you do not take our relationship seriously. do we have to start arguing again? if you were a klingon, we would already be married. - i'm not a klingon. - that is no excuse. i have been loyal to you and i expect you to be loyal to me. - i have been, but you can't run my life. - i'm not trying to. then i'm going to have a big glass of icoberry juice. that is a mistake. you are allergic to icoberry juice. it makes your... spots itch. - but i like the taste. - fine. have as much icoberry juice as you like. but it is still a mistake. but it is my mistake to make. go up to our room, put on your bathing suit and we'll go for a swim in the lagoon. as you wish. enter. i hope i'm not disturbing you. i am pascal fullerton of the new essentialists movement. i'm not familiar with it. we're dedicated to restoring the traditions of the federation. this is a statement of our principles. but if you'd like to hear more we're holding a rally later. - on risa? - what better place? this world revels in the self-indulgence that's eroding federation society. we intend to shut it down. - i wish you'd stop reading that. - i would not dismiss fullerton. his analysis of federation history is insightful and disturbing. what's disturbing is that you're still in uniform. it would not hurt you to read this. the truth is not everyone can be a dabo girl. you have to be able to wear the clothes and believe me, that's not easy. you have to be able to calculate odds in your head very quickly and most importantly, you need a very supple wrist... like this. dabo. ...end of the federation since the day it was founded. - oh, hi. - leeta, what a surprise. care to join us? we're about to take a reyamilk soak. maybe later. worf. worf! - that was not dr bashir. - it's none of our business. are you defending her actions? i am not defending anything but it's not my business or yours. let's take in the sights. i cannot. the essentialists are having a rally and i plan to attend. you're kidding. you're not kidding. don't they have anything better to do? you underestimate the power of fullerton's message. the plot thickens. and you were worried about julian. why are he and leeta not together? i don't know but don't jump to conclusions. i'm sure there's an explanation. this place is a bad influence on people. - here for the show? - i would not call it a show. really? i find mr fullerton very entertaining. he's determined to discourage people from coming here. risa receives millions of visitors every year. all of them leave happy. i don't see how one man can change that. kahless fought off an entire army and he was only one man. fullerton has been here for a month. no matter how many speeches he gives, the water's still warm and the wind still smells sweet. but who are we to discourage him? that's right. take a good look. i can only imagine what you must think of me - a middle-aged, ponderous academic, sweating under the hot risian suns, wasting his time telling you things you don't want to hear. but you know what i see when i look at you? children. pampered, spoiled children. the citizens of the federation now believe that they are entitled to... i may be wrong, but didn't he just insult us? if you want food, you get it from a replicator. if you want amusement, you go to a holosuite. and if you need protection, you call for starfleet. but someday... you're going to have to learn to take care of yourselves, because if i see you as helpless children, then how do you think the borg see you? or the romulans or the klingons or the dominion? these empires look at the federation and they see a prize - a prize that we have forgotten how to protect. and if we don't change our ways, they're going to take it from us. mr fullerton has quite a flair for the dramatic. - does he really believe that? - i think he does. ...the kind of hard work that built the federation in the first place. or we can lie here napping in the sun until we wake up with jem'hadar guns to our heads. the choice is ours. heaven help us if we make the wrong one. what are you talking about? this sounds like nonsense. the klingons wouldn't have attacked had they not believed the federation vulnerable. since the changeling was discovered on the high council most of my people continue to call for war because they think they can win. - this has nothing to do with risa. - you cannot be certain of that. i've spent lifetimes defending the federation and i deserve a vacation every now and then. julian? there you are. i am so glad we came here. i'm having a wonderful time. i told you this was just what we needed. - something wrong? - it's nothing. you two dishonour each other with your actions. do you know what he's talking about? you mean... we didn't tell you why we came here? - this is the rite of separation. - it's an old bajoran custom. when a couple separates they spend days celebrating their parting. it's a way to remember all the good times and to seek out new opportunities. a very wise and ancient culture. i don't think i've completely gotten you out of my system yet. i know exactly what you mean. excuse us. we have a few... details to work out. terminating a relationship should not be taken so frivolously. not every relationship has to end like a klingon opera. no. just the ones that are important. stay where you are. on three. one, two... wait. that's enough. well... i hope we've proved our point. - the power cells are empty. - we won't harm anyone. i don't understand. you think you're safe here in this ""paradise” of yours, but you're not. what if we had been jem'hadar or klingons or romulans... you'd be dead now. even you starfleet officers were lulled into a false sense of security. if you could be taken unaware, what chance do the rest of us have? the sad truth is the galaxy is a hostile place. forget that even for a moment and you risk losing everything. just something for you to think about while you wait for your desserts. demonstration's over. move along. i have the authority to arrest you for what you just did. that would be a waste of time. the risians won't prosecute. they don't have the courage. believe me, i wish they did. what did you think of our little demonstration? i cannot condone what you have done. maybe not but i do think you understand it. i don't know about you, but it's past my bedtime. we need to talk. - about the essentialists? - no. about us. i suppose you have another list of things i'm doing wrong. i did not say you were doing anything wrong. it's just that... some of your behaviour... what about my behaviour? you are too impulsive. you act without thinking. - you have no self-control. - you think i need you to control me? jadzia, you are my par'machkai. everything you do reflects on me. i'm sorry if i embarrass you. i just need to know that you take this relationship as seriously as i do. and i just wish you'd relax a little and let yourself enjoy what we have. worf, i'm not going to change who i am. nor am i. well, at least we agree on something. - why don't we go to bed? - you go. i will be there shortly. this place looks a lot better than it did last night. the risians aren't as lethargic as the essentialists would like to believe. they are wrong about many things. what mr fullerton could use is a little jamaharon. no, a lot of jamaharon. i'd buy him a horga'hn myself if i thought he'd take it. he's not the only one that could use some cheering up. - i've had better vacations. - better than risa? i've never known a klingon who had a tougher time enjoying himself. that's no reason for you not to have a good time. risa is famous for its diversions. i wish it were that simple. - it was for curzon dax. - yeah. and i can tell there's more than a little curzon in you. - he loved this planet. - and risa loved him. why don't i help you clean up? all that is ours is yours. our paths have grown apart. what was one is now two. the time for sharing is over. may the prophets guide you toward the path of happiness. and may they walk with you always. - that's it? - that's it. - what were you expecting? - i was expecting fireworks. where's the anger? the name-calling? the irrational accusations? i never would have been a witness if i'd known you were going to be so civil. - it's disgusting. - i think it was admirable. no recriminations, no hurt feelings. i've never felt this good about the end of a relationship. i agree. now i can be honest about my feelings. what... does that mean? it's just... in the past few months i've been... thinking a lot about another man. let me get this straight. while you were still dating julian you were fantasising about someone else? - i'd rather not discuss it now. - you might as well tell me who it is. yes, do tell. it's... me? your brother. rom. - my brother rom? - his brother rom? he's so cute. and very sexy. - ""cute""? - ""sexy""? rom? here. you need this more than i do. - doesn't the clay feel good? - wonderful. now pour your emotions into it. begin to mold it. - feel the texture in your hands. - i do. i feel it. i really do. i knew you'd get it. - dax. - worf! worf! i'm tired of giving speeches. it's time we took action. - we have - the raid on the solarium. - it'll be forgotten by tomorrow. mr worf? you want to make people leave risa... i think i know a way. i probably would have reacted the same way worf did. i know arandis is curzon's lover, but if i'd walked in on the two of you... - figuring you out isn't easy. - i like that about her. so do i. it's why i chased after her so long. would you two please stop talking about me like i'm not here. it's also the reason why i stopped chasing her. you're too much work. worf is the one who's too much work. what you need is a ferengi. maybe but what i want is worf. why? because he has the courage of a berserker cat and he has the heart of a poet. - and the brain of a pigheaded idiot. - yeah, sometimes. jadzia... - any luck? - i'm afraid not. none of the staff can find him but i'm sure he'll turn up. no sense waiting around here for him. i say we take some floaters and go skinny-dipping in the hot springs. i never thought i'd say this but i'm with quark. - what was that? - great. just what we needed. i thought it wasn't supposed to rain here. it's not. something must be wrong with the weather grid. may i have your attention, please. the weather grid is experiencing a malfunction but we'll be able to repair it soon. no. you won't. - you're responsible for this. - i authorised it but it was not my idea. - it was mine. - are you serious? he's serious. did you take control of the weather grid? the grid has been deactivated. it will take three or four days to restore the system to normal. the inhabitants of risa and their guests will experience the planet's natural weather cycle. and that means rain, and plenty of it. but why are you doing this? because risa is an illusion created by weather control systems, industrial replicators, seismic regulators. if the federation is going to survive, we'll have to stop wasting our time with toys and get back to the essentials. i'm beginning to think there's no hope for that man. or for you, either, mr worf. commander, with all due respect, are you out of your mind? i think you will find me quite rational. as rational as klingons get, anyway. - this is wrong. - i disagree. if federation citizens cannot handle bad weather, how will they handle a dominion invasion? i have seen drier days on ferenginar and we have 178 different words for rain. right now, it's glebbening out there. and that's bad. why don't you take your horga'hn and go find some company? have you taken a good look at the risians lately? they're more depressed than the guests. i'm organising a game of hoverball. would you like to join us? - in the rain? - no, on one of the indoor courts. indoor hoverball. that's just wrong. - i'll play. - good. that makes one. having trouble keeping the guests happy? i've never heard so much complaining. nobody came here to sit around in the rain. it's not just the weather. people are complaining about everything - the rooms, the entertainment, the food. - what's wrong with the food? - nothing, as far as i can tell. but the guests say it just doesn't taste right. it's the humidity. it dampens the food, makes everything mushy. trust me. there's no word for ""crisp"" on ferenginar. maybe mr fullerton was right. maybe we have forgotten how to deal with adversity. the guest population has declined by 30% in the last three days. the guests that have stayed are taking what you say seriously. - it's a start. - one that you can build on. you're leaving? i have had my fill of risa. mr worf, you've been an inspiration to us all. - good luck. - thank you. do you have the uplink to the weather control grid? right here. by tomorrow, the weather grid will be restored and no one here will remember this ever happened. but i intend to send a message they won't forget. you must be feeling good. the weather's terrible, the guests are miserable and more people are leaving risa every day. their response proves my point. i see. ruin the vacations of a few hundred thousand people to bolster the moral fibre of the federation. i do not expect you to understand. i understand... even better than you do. what you did had nothing to do with risa or the essentialists or even the federation. it's about you and me. - you give yourself far too much credit. - doll? you think i'm irresponsible, frivolous... that i care more about pleasure than i do commitment. what do you think is going on between me and arandis? you know what i think. that's right. i do. and you know what? you're wrong. did it occur to you to ask me about it? or.. trust, just a little? a klingon woman would not give grounds for suspicion. how would you know? curzon spent more time with klingons than you. you may have lived among my people but you are not a klingon. i am. maybe so. but you're not like any klingon i've ever met. what happened to you, worf? you're a paragon of klingon honour and discipline but when it comes to the klingon passion for life, the exuberance, the enjoyment of the moment, you are constantly holding yourself back. - why? - that is not the issue here. i think it is. - i do not wish to lose you. - then talk to me, please. you know from the age of seven i was raised by humans on gault. it was a sparsely populated world, no more than 20,000 inhabitants. it often seemed as though everyone knew everybody else. but one thing was for certain - everybody knew me. i was the klingon child, the uncontrollable one. i was the biggest, strongest, most fearless child on the planet. i fought hard, played hard, did as i pleased. what changed? when i was 13, i was captain of my school soccer team. we had made the championships, and i was determined to win. near the end of the second half with the score tied, my team got a corner kick. the ball sailed up high. i and one of my opponents, a human boy named mikel, leapt up to head the ball. he had position, but i was determined to score. i remember laughing with excitement as i threw myself at him. goon. the next thing i knew, the ball was sailing into their goal. i roared with triumph and turned around to mikel to gloat, only to find him lying in the grass bleeding. our heads had collided when we both went up for the ball. i had not felt the impact but i had broken his neck and... he died the next day. - it was an accident. - which only makes it worse. compared to klingons, humans are fragile creatures. i realised at that moment, to live among them, i must practise restraint. that must have been difficult for you. at first. in time, it became a part of who i was, who... i am. you're still afraid that if you lose control... someone i care about might get hurt. that explains a lot. but you have to realise there are some things in life you can't control and one of them is me. but what you can do is trust me. i care about you, worf, and i would never do anything to hurt you. nor would i do anything to hurt you. who knows? i may have more self-control than you give me credit for. that felt like an earthquake. - so did that. - the essentialists. you should see them all run. they've finally realised that the party's over. increase the feedback. there won't be a building left standing on risa. it might be a good idea to head to the spaceport. or at least get out of this room. very well. - i think our work is done here. - the uplink. give it to me. i suggest you all get off this planet as soon as possible. i have no wish to see you harmed. give us the uplink or the only person who will be harmed is you. - i thought you were one of us. - perhaps i was for a time. but the federation will survive the dominion, the borg and people like you. you're turning your back on the federation. don't you see? overindulgence, lack of self-control - they'll destroy everything we hold dear and you will be responsible. you say that we must return to traditional values. i agree, but one of those values is trust. it is essential that we remember that. don't you walk away from me. i will do as i please. i am on vacation. figures. the weather improves the day we leave. i can't wait to get home. not that i didn't enjoy myself. i'd better go find bashir. he brought a horga'hn to breakfast and that's the last i saw of him. i hope the two of you enjoyed risa and will come again. i did not think that i would be welcome. you still have a lot to learn about our people. i never got a chance to say goodbye to curzon dax. you're not saying goodbye to me either. i'll be back. and risa will be waiting. what do we do now? now we watch the suns set. i have a better idea. why don't we go swimming? i... didn't bring a bathing suit. i won't tell if you don't. english"

[clicking tongue] poor norman. he's just out of hospital. i got my leader writer to attack the horror of street violence today. shows you the value of sympathy, jerry. norman has now agreed to stock my newspapers. yeah, he was a toughie. i thought the slashed tires would be enough. i'm not interested in details. is that all? it's what we agreed. yeah, but-- but i had to pay the heavier bit extra. that's your miscalculation. i'll tell you what. i'll settle for that receipt. what receipt? for the garage business. you'd have got five years if i hadn't refunded the money you stole. yes, i know, gb. and-- and i'm very grateful. but that receipt is as a good as a confession, you see. of course it is. how could i possibly employ you for these little services-- [phone rings] --if i don't have some sort of a safeguard? you can trust me. [chuckle] paula. gb (voiceover): it was our 10th anniversary. hello, frank. why haven't you invited me? you'd be sicker of the table.

[door opens] [door closes] gb (voiceover): paula was excellent value for money. i gave her a house, a horse, a ferrari, and a clothes account. she graced my table and shared my bed. although after a time, we mutually deleted sex from the agreement. success depends on logic, not love or sentiment. frank: you wouldn't miss it. 10,000 for six months. gb: what do i get for it? be logical, frank. your firm's finished. you couldn't repay me. i could. i can sell up if i can keep the business going. i've cooked the books. the auditors are in. come on, frank. i'll give you something. you will? i have an excellent five-star brandy that will make you feel much better. [attendees laughing] [sigh] [birds chirping] frank's killed himself. i expect that will be the verdict. i must see if there's a good obituary in the ""herald"" tonight. how much did he try and borrow last week? 10,000. is that all? you haven't got the slightest twinge of conscience. no. he was lucky for a time, but he was weak, a gambler. he would've killed himself eventually. why should he do so with my 10,000 pounds? you are a bastard. so you said when you married me. i, um, also said you were the most thoroughly sensible man i know. logical. logical. [loud revving] gb (voiceover): i congratulated myself on my calmness. but it was followed by a wave of anger such as i had never known. i remembered when i was 11. my father told me mother had left home forever to live with another man. i didn't employ a private detective. he might have inhibited my future actions. i said nothing while i considered the problem logically. paula had broken our agreement. she no longer gave value for money. [beeping] divorce, no punishment. she might even welcome it. disfigurement. i couldn't divorce a scarred woman without incurring censure. there was only one solution. fresh problem. i would be the obvious suspect. fag? gb: fag. hello, gb. this is an honor. come to inspect the stock? i'll give you a good trade-in. 14 [inaudible]. is that reliable? reliable? of course it's reliable. it's just been serviced. where can we talk? [metallic clanking, engines  rumbling] it's a bit like the wholesaler. no problem. i want someone to do a proper job.

[hangs up] gb (voiceover): i couldn't stand being in someone else's hands. [laughter and music playing] i decided to confront paula, force her to give up her lover. but that weekend, we had another glittering party. [phone rings] she hadn't told me she had invited her lover. peter! peter simpson, my husband. a smashing place you've got here. come in. it's through here, peter. ah, anna. i've forgotten i'd invited him. he hunts. he's a [inaudible]. i believe i've come across him. he's a bit of a bore, but i thought i'd pay him some attention. after all, they've never advertised with you, have they, darling?

[door opens and closes] the night the deadline was passed, i came home. gb: paula? hello. [yawn] what a day. i've been working so hard for you. got you some advertising space with peter simpson. what do you think of that? what's wrong? wrong? you look as if you've seen a ghost. oh, it's just some business deal. i'm beginning to wonder if i haven't been swindled. [chuckle] swindled? you? i don't believe it.

0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"woman: how's your blog going? yeah, good. very good. you haven't written a word, have you? you just wrote ""still has trust issues"". and you read my writing upside down. you see what i mean? john, you're a soldier, and it's going to take you a while to adjust to civilian life, and writing a blog about everything that happens to you will honestly help you. nothing happens to me. man: what do you mean, there's no ruddy car? he went to waterloo, i'm sorry. - get a cab! - i never get cabs! - i love you. - when? get a cab! woman: my husband... was a happy man who lived life to the full. he loved his family and his work, and that he should have taken his own life in this way is a mystery and a shock to all who knew him. yes, yes! taxi! (whistles) - i'll be back in two minutes, mate. - what? - i'm just going home to get my umbrella. - you can share mine. two minutes, all right? she still dancing? yeah, if you can call it that. - did you get the car keys off her? - got them out of her bag. where is she? the body of beth davenport, junior minister for transport, was found late last night on a building site in greater london. preliminary investigations suggest that this was suicide. we can confirm that this apparent suicide closely resembles those of sirjeffrey patterson and james phillimore. in the light of this, these incidents are now being treated as linked. the investigation is ongoing, but detective inspector lestrade will take questions now. detective inspector, how can suicides be linked? well, they all took the same poison. they were all found in places they had no reason to be. none of them had shown - any prior indication. - but you can't have serial suicides. well, apparently you can. these three people, there's nothing that links them? there's no link we've found yet, but we're looking for it - there has to be one. (mobiles beep) if you've all got texts, - please ignore them. - it just says ""wrong"". well, just ignore that. if there are no more questions for detective inspector lestrade, i'm going to bring this session to an end. if they're suicides, what are you investigating? as i say, these suicides are clearly linked. it's an unusual situation. we've got our best people investigating. (mobiles beep) - says ""wrong"" again. - one more question. is there any chance that these are murders? and if they are, is this the work of a serial killer? i know that you like writing about these, but these do appear to be suicides. we know the difference. the poison was clearly self-administered. yes, but if they are murders, how do people keep themselves safe? well, don't commit suicide. (whispers) dailymail. obviously, this is a frightening time for people, but all anyone has to do is exercise reasonable precautions. - we are all as safe as we want to be. - (mobiles beep) thank you. you've got to stop him doing that. he's making us look like idiots. if you can tell me how he does it, i'll stop him. john! john watson! stamford, mike stamford. we were at barts together. yes, sorry, yes, mike, hello. - yeah, i know, i got fat. - no, no. i heard you were abroad somewhere getting shot at. what happened? i got shot. are you still at barts, then? teaching now, yeah. bright young things like we used to be. god, i hate them. what about you? just staying in town till you get yourself sorted? i can't afford london on an army pension. you couldn't bear to be anywhere else. that's not the john watson i know. yeah, i'm notthe john watson... couldn't harry help? yeah, like that's going to happen (!) i don't know, get a flatshare or something? come on, who'd want me for a flatmate? (laughs) what? you're the second person to say that to me today. who was the first? how fresh? just in. 67, natural causes. used to work here. i knew him, he was nice. fine. we'll start with the riding crop. so, bad day, was it? i need to know what bruises form in the next 20 minutes. a man's alibi depends on it. text me. listen, i was wondering. maybe later, when you're finished... you're wearing lipstick. you weren't wearing lipstick before. i, er... i refreshed it a bit. sorry, you were saying? i was wondering if you'd like to have coffee. black, two sugars, please. i'll be upstairs. ok. (knock on door) - bit different from my day. - you've no idea! mike, can i borrow your phone? there's no signal on mine. - and what's wrong with the landline? - i prefer to text. sorry, it's in my coat. er, here...use mine. oh, thank you. this is an old friend of mine, john watson. afghanistan or iraq? - sorry? - which was it, in afghanistan or iraq? afghanistan. sorry, how did you...? ah, molly, coffee, thank you. what happened to the lipstick? it wasn't working for me. really? i thought it was a big improvement. your mouth's too small now. ok. how do you feel about the violin? i'm sorry, what? i play the violin when i'm thinking and sometimes i don't talk for days on end. would that bother you? potential flatmates should know the worst about each other. - you told him about me? - not a word. who said anything about flatmates? i did. told mike this morning i must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for. now here he is, just after lunch, with an old friend clearly just home from military service in afghanistan. - wasn't a difficult leap. - how did you know about afghanistan? got my eye on a nice little place in central london. we ought to be able to afford it. we'll meet there tomorrow evening, seven o'clock. sorry, got to dash. i think i left my riding crop in the mortuary. is that it? is that what? we've only just met and we're going to go and look at a flat? problem? we don't know a thing about each other. i don't know where we're meeting. i don't even know your name. i know you're an army doctor and you've been invalided home from afghanistan. you've got a brother worried about you, but you won't go to him for help because you don't approve of him, possibly because he's an alcoholic, more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. and i know your therapist thinks your limp's psychosomatic, quite correctly, i'm afraid. that's enough to be going on with, don't you think? the name's sherlock holmes, and the address is 22 1 b baker street. afternoon. he's always like that. hello. - ah, mr holmes. - sherlock, please. well, this is a prime spot. must be expensive. mrs hudson, the landlady - she's given me a special deal. owes me a favour. a few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in florida. i was able to help out. sorry, you stopped her husband being executed? oh, no, i ensured it. sherlock! mrs hudson, drjohn watson. - hello. come in. - thank you. shall we...? well, this could be very nice. very nice indeed. yes. yes, i think so, my thoughts precisely. - so i went straight ahead and moved in. - soon as we get this rubbish cleaned up. oh. so this is all... well, obviously i can straighten things up a bit. - that's a skull. - friend of mine. when i say friend... what do you think, then, dr watson? there's another bedroom upstairs, if you'll be needing two bedrooms. of course we'll be needing two. oh, don't worry, there's all sorts round here. mrs turner next door's got married ones. oh...sherlock! the mess you've made. i looked you up on the internet last night. anything interesting? found your website. the science of deduction. what did you think? you said you could identify a software designer by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb? yes. and i can read your military career in your face and your leg, and your brother's drinking habits in your mobile phone. how? what about these suicides, then, sherlock? i thought that'd be right up your street. three exactly the same. four. there's been a fourth. and there's something different - this time. - a fourth? - where? - brixton, lauriston gardens. what's new about this one? you wouldn't have come to me otherwise. you know how they never leave notes? this one did. - will you come? - who's on forensics? - anderson. - he doesn't work well with me. - well, he won't be your assistant. - i needan assistant. will you come? not in a police car, i'll be right behind. thank you. brilliant! yes! four serial suicides and now a note. oh, it's christmas. mrs hudson, i'll be late. might need some food. i'm your landlady, dear, not your housekeeper. something cold will do. john, have a cup of tea, make yourself at home. don't wait up! look at him, dashing about... my husband was just the same. but you're more the sitting-down type, i can tell. i'll make you that cuppa, you rest your leg. damn my leg! sorry, i'm so sorry. it's just sometimes this bloody thing... i understand, dear, i've got a hip. cup of tea'd be lovely. thank you. just this once, dear, i'm not your housekeeper. couple of biscuits too, if you've got 'em. not your housekeeper! you're a doctor. in fact, you're an army doctor. yes. any good? very good. seen a lot of injuries, then. violent deaths. well, yes. bit of trouble too, i bet? of course. yes. enough for a lifetime, far too much. - want to see some more? - oh, god, yes. sorry, mrs hudson, i'll skip the tea. off out. - both of you? - impossible suicides? four of them? no point sitting at home when there's finally something fun going on! - look at you, all happy. it's not decent. - who cares about decent? the game, mrs hudson, is on! taxi! - ok, you've got questions... - yeah, where are we going? crime scene. next? - who are you? what do you do? - what do you think? - i'd say...private detective. - but...? but the police don't go to private detectives. i'm a consulting detective. only one in the world. i invented the job. what does that mean? it means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, - they consult me. - the police don't consult amateurs. when i met you for the first time yesterday, i said afghanistan or iraq. - you looked surprised. - yes, how didyou know? i didn't know, i saw. your haircut, the way you hold yourself says military. but your conversation... bit different from my day. ...said trained at barts - so army doctor, obvious. your face is tanned... but no tan above the wrists. you've been abroad, but not sunbathing. your limp's bad when you walk, but you don't ask for a chair when you stand, like you've forgotten about it, so it's at least partly psychosomatic. that says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic. wounded in action, then. wounded in action, suntan - afghanistan or iraq. you said i had a therapist. you've got a psychosomatic limp, of course you've got a therapist. then there's your brother. your phone. it's expensive, e-mail enabled, mp3 player. you're looking for a flatshare. you wouldn't buy this - it's a gift. scratches. not one, many over time - it's been in the same pocket as keys and coins. you wouldn't treat your one luxury item like this, so it's had a previous owner. next bit's easy. you know it already. the engraving? harry watson. clearly a family member who's given you his old phone. not your father, this is a young man's gadget. could be a cousin, but you're a war hero who can't find a place to live. unlikely you've got an extended family, not one you're close to. so brother it is. now, who's clara? three kisses says it's a romantic attachment. the expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend. must have given it to him recently, the model's only six months old. marriage in trouble, then - six months on he's given it away. if she'd left him, he would have kept it. sentiment. no, he wanted rid of it. he left her. he gave the phone to you, so he wants you to stay in touch. you're looking for cheap accommodation, but not going to your brother for help. that says you've got problems with him. maybe you liked his wife or don't like his drinking. how can you possibly know about the drinking? shot in the dark. good one, though. power connection - tiny little scuff marks round the edge. every night he plugs it in to charge, but his hands are shaking. you never see those marks on a sober man's phone, never see a drunk's without them. there you go, you were right. iwas right? right about what? the police don't consult amateurs. that...was amazing. - do you think so? - of course it was. it was extraordinary, quite extraordinary. - that's not what people normally say. - what do people normally say? piss off! did i get anything wrong? harry and me don't get on, never have. clara and harry split up three months ago and they're getting a divorce. and harry is a drinker. spot on, then. i didn't expect to be right about everything. harry's short for harriet. harry's your sister. what exactly am i supposed to be doing here? - sister! - no, seriously, what am i doing here? there's always something. hello, freak! i'm here to see detective inspector lestrade. - why? - i was invited. - why? - i think he wants me to take a look. - you know what i think, don't you? - always, sally. i even know you didn't make it home last night. - er...who's this? - colleague of mine, dr watson. dr watson, sergeant sally donovan. old friend. a colleague? how do you get a colleague? did he follow you home? - would it be better if i just waited...? - no. freak's here. bringing him in. ah, anderson. here we are again. it's a crime scene. i don't want it contaminated. are we clear on that? quite clear. and is your wife away for long? oh, don't pretend you worked that out. somebody told you that. your deodorant told me that. - my deodorant? - it's for men. well, of course it's for men - i'm wearing it. so's sergeant donovan. (holmes sniffs) ooh...i think it just vaporised. may i go in? whatever you're trying to imply... i'm not implying anything. i'm sure sally came round for a nice little chat and just happened to stay over. and i assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees. you'll need to wear one of these. who's this? he's with me. - but who is he? - i said he's with me. aren't you going to put one on? - so where are we? - upstairs. i can give you two minutes. may need longer. her name's jennifer wilson, according to her credit cards. we're running them now for contact details. hasn't been here long. some kids found her. shut up. - i didn't say anything. - you were thinking. it's annoying. got anything? not much. she's german. rache. it's german for revenge. - she could be trying to tell us... - yes, thank you for your input. - so she's german? - of course she's not. she's from out of town, though. intended to stay in london for one night before returning home to cardiff - so far, so obvious. - sorry, obvious? - what about the message, though? dr watson, what do you think? - of the message? - of the body. you're a medical man. - we have a whole team outside. - they won't work with me. i'm breaking every rule letting you in here... yes, because you need me. yes, i do. god help me. - dr watson! - hm? oh, do as he says. help yourself. lestrade: anderson, keep everyone out for a couple of minutes... - well? - what am i doing here? - helping me make a point. - i'm supposed to help you pay the rent. - this is more fun. - fun? there's a woman lying dead. perfectly sound analysis, but i was hoping you'd go deeper. yeah... asphyxiation...probably. passed out, choked on her own vomit. can't smell any alcohol on her. it could have been a seizure. possibly drugs. you know what it was, you've read the papers. well, she's one of the suicides. the fourth...? sherlock, two minutes, i said. i need anything you've got. victim is in her late 30s. professional person, going by her clothes. i'm guessing the media, going by the frankly alarming shade of pink. travelled from cardiff today, intending to stay in london for one night from the size of her suitcase. - suitcase? - yes. she's been married at least ten years, but not happily. she's had a string of lovers, but none of them knew she was married. oh, for god's sake, if you're just making this up... her wedding ring. ten years old at least. the rest of herjewellery has been regularly cleaned, but not her wedding ring. state of her marriage right there. the inside is shinier than the outside, so it's regularly removed. the only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger. it's not for work, look at her nails. she doesn't work with her hands, so what or who does she remove her rings for? not one lover, she'd never sustain the fiction of being single for that long, - so more likely a string of them. simple. - that's brilliant. - sorry. - cardiff? - it's obvious, isn't it? - it's not obvious to me. dear god, what is it like in your funny little brains? it must be so boring. her coat - it's slightly damp, she's been in heavy rain in the last few hours - no rain anywhere in london in that time. under her coat collar is damp too. she's turned it up against the wind. she's got an umbrella in her pocket, but it's dry and unused. not just wind, strong wind - too strong to use her umbrella. we know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight, but she can't have travelled more than two or three hours, because her coat still hasn't dried. so, where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time? cardiff. - that's fantastic. - do you know you do that out loud? - sorry, i'll shut up. - no, it's...fine. - why do you keep saying suitcase? - yes, where is it? she must have had a phone or an organiser. find out who rachel is. she was writing rachel? no, she was leaving an angry note in german! of course she was writing rachel, no other word it can be. but why did she wait until she was dying to write it? how do you know she had a suitcase? tiny splash marks on her right heel and calf not present on the left. she was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand. don't get that splash pattern any other way. smallish case, going by the spread. case that size, woman this clothes-conscious - could only be an overnight bag so we know she was staying one night. where is it? what have you done with it? there wasn't a case. - say that again. - there wasn't a case. there was never any suitcase. suitcase! did anyone find a suitcase? was there a suitcase in this house? sherlock, there was no case! but they take the poison themselves, they swallow the pills. there are clear signs, even you lot couldn't miss them. right, thanks. and...? it's murder, all of them. i don't know how. but they're not suicides, they're serial killings. we've got a serial killer. love those. there's always something to look forward to. - why are you saying that? - her case! come on, where is her case? did she eat it(?) someone else was here and they took her case. so the killer must have driven here. forgot the case was in the car. she could have checked into a hotel, left it there. no, she never got to the hotel. look at her hair. she colour-coordinates her lipstick and shoes. she'd never have left any hotel with her hair still looking... oh... oh! sherlock? what is it, what? serial killers, always hard. you have to wait for them to make a mistake. - we can't just wait! - oh, we're done waiting. look at her, really look! houston, we have a mistake. get on to cardiff. find out who jennifer wilson's family and friends were. find rachel! of course, yeah - but what mistake?! pink! anderson: let's get on with it... - he's gone. - who, sherlock holmes? yeah, he just took off. he does that. - is he coming back? - didn't look like it. right. right... yes. sorry, where am i? brixton. do you know where i could get a cab? it's just, er... well... my leg. er... ...try the main road. thanks. but you're not his friend. he doesn't have friends. so who are you? i'm...i'm nobody. i just met him. ok, bit of advice, then. stay away from that guy. why? you know why he's here? he's not paid or anything. he likes it. he gets off on it. the weirder the crime, the more he gets off. and you know what...? one day just showing up won't be enough. one day we'll be standing round a body, and he'll be the one that put it there. - why would he do that? - because he's a psychopath. psychopaths get bored. - lestrade: donovan! - coming. stay away from sherlock holmes. (phone rings) (phone stops ringing) taxi! taxi... (phone rings) (phone rings off abruptly) (phone rings) (phone keeps ringing) hello? man: there is a security camera on the building to your left. do you see it? who's this? who's speaking? do you see the camera, dr watson? - yeah, i see it. - watch... there is another camera on the building opposite you. do you see it? mm-hm. and finally, at the top of the building on your right. (camera whirrs) how are you doing this? get into the car, dr watson. i would make some sort of threat, but i'm sure your situation is quite clear to you. - hello. - hi. what's your name, then? er...anthea. - is that your real name? - no. i'm john. yes. i know. any point in asking...where i'm going? none at all... john. ok. have a seat, john. you know, i've got a phone. i mean, very clever and all that, but, er... you could just phone me. on my phone. when one is avoiding the attention of sherlock holmes, one learns to be discreet, hence this place. your leg must be hurting you. sit down. i don't want to sit down. you don't seem very afraid. you don't seem very frightening. (chuckles) yes... the bravery of the soldier. bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don't you think? what is your connection to sherlock holmes? i don't have one. i barely know him. i met him...yesterday. mmm, and since yesterday, you've moved in with him and now you're solving crimes together. might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week? - who are you? - an interested party. interested in sherlock? why? i'm guessing you're not friends. you've met him. how many friends do you imagine he has? i am the closest thing to a friend that sherlock holmes is capable of having. - and what's that? - an enemy. - an enemy? - in his mind, certainly. if you were to ask him, he'd probably say his arch-enemy. he does love to be dramatic. well, thank god you're above all that(!) (text message alert) i hope i'm not distracting you. not distracting me at all. do you plan to continue your association with sherlock holmes? i could be wrong... but i think that's none of your business. - it could be. - it really couldn't. if you do move into, um... ...22 1 b baker street, i'd be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way. - why? - because you're not a wealthy man. in exchange for what? information. nothing indiscreet. nothing you'd feel...uncomfortable with. - just tell me what he's up to. - why? i worry about him. constantly. that's nice of you. but i would prefer for various reasons that my concern go unmentioned. we have what you might call a... difficult relationship. (text message alert) - no. - but i haven't mentioned a figure. - don't bother. - you're very loyal veryquickly. no, i'm not, i'm just not interested. ""trust issues"", it says here. what's that? could it be that you've decided to trust sherlock holmes of all people? who says i trust him? you don't seem the kind to make friends easily. - are we done? - you tell me. i imagine people have already warned you to stay away from him, but i can see from your left hand that's not going to happen. - my what? - show me. don't... - remarkable. - what is? most people blunder round this city and all they see are streets and shops and cars. when you walk with sherlock holmes, you see the battlefield. you've seen it already, haven't you? what's wrong with my hand? you have an intermittent tremor in your left hand. your therapist thinks it's post-traumatic stress disorder. she thinks you're haunted by memories of your military service. who the hell are you? - how do you know that? - fire her. she's got it the wrong way round. you're under stress right now, and your hand is perfectly steady. you're not haunted by the war, dr watson... you miss it. welcome back. (text message alert) time to choose a side, dr watson. i'm to take you home. address? er, baker street. 22 1 b baker street. but i need to stop off somewhere first. listen, your boss. any chance you could not tell him this is where i went? - sure. - you've told him already, haven't you? yeah. hey, um... do you ever get any free time? (chuckles) oh, yeah. lots. - bye. - ok. (exhales slowly) - what are you doing? - nicotine patch. helps me think. impossible to sustain a smoking habit in london these days. bad news for brain work. - it's good news for breathing. - oh, breathing! breathing's boring. is that...three patches? it's a three-patch problem. well...? you asked me to come, i'm assuming it's important. oh, yeah, of course. can i borrow your phone? my phone? always a chance that my number will be recognised. it's on the website. mrs hudson's got a phone. she's downstairs. i shouted, but she didn't hear. - i wasthe other side of london... - there was no hurry. here... so what's this about - the case? - her case... - hercase? her suitcase, yes, obviously. the murderer took her suitcase, first big mistake. ok, he took her case. so? it's no use, there's no other way. we'll have to risk it. on my desk there's a number. i want you to send a text. you've brought me here... to send a text. text, yes. the number on my desk. - what's wrong? - just met a friend of yours. - a friend? - an enemy. oh. which one? well, your arch-enemy, according to him. do people have arch-enemies? did he offer you money to spy on me? - yes. - did you take it? - no. - pity, we could have split the fee. - think it through next time. - who is he? the most dangerous man you've ever met and not my problem right now. on my desk, the number! jennifer wilson. that was... hang on. wasn't that the dead woman? yes. that's not important. just enter the number. - are you doing it? - yes. - have you done it? - yeah, hang on! these words exactly. ""what happened at lauriston gardens? ""i must have blacked out. ""22 northumberland street, please come."" - you blacked out? - what? no... no! type and send it. quickly. - have you sent it? - what's the address? 22 northumberland street. hurry up! that's... that's the pink lady's case, that's jennifer wilson's case. yes, obviously. oh, perhaps i should mention - ididn't kill her. - i never said you did. - why not? given that text and the fact i have her case, it's a perfectly logical assumption. do people usually assume you're the murderer? now and then, yes. ok... - how did you get this? - by looking. where? the killer must have driven her to lauriston gardens. he could only keep her case by accident if it was in a car. nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention - particularly a man, which is statistically more likely. so obviously he'd feel compelled to get rid of it. wouldn't have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake. i checked every backstreet wide enough for a car five minutes from lauriston gardens and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed. took me less than an hour to find the right skip. pink. you got all that because you realised the case would be pink? - it had to be pink, obviously. - why didn't i think of that(?) because you're an idiot. no, no, don't look like that. practically everyone is. now, look. do you see what's missing? from the case? how could i? her phone. where's her mobile phone? there was no phone on the body, there's no phone in the case. we know she had one. you just texted it. maybe she left it at home. she has a string of lovers and she's careful about it. she never leaves her phone at home. er... why did i just send that text? well, the question is where is her phone now? - she could have lost it. - yes, or? the murderer... you think the murderer has the phone? maybe she...left it when she left her case. maybe he took it from her for some reason. either way, the balance of probability is the murderer has her phone. sorry...what are we doing? did i just text a murderer? what good will that do? (phone rings) a few hours after his last victim, and now he receives a text that can only be from her. if somebody had just found that phone, they'd ignore a text like that, but the murderer... would panic. - have you talked to the police? - four people are dead, there isn't time. so why are you talking to me? mrs hudson took my skull. so i'm basically filling in for your skull? relax, you're doing fine. - well? - well, what? well...you could just sit there and...watch telly. you want me to come with you? i like company when i go out and i think better when i talk aloud. the skull just attracts attention, so... - problem? - yeah, sergeant donovan. what about her? she said you get off on this, you enjoy it. and i said ""dangerous"", and here you are. damn it! where are we going? northumberland street's a five-minute walk from here. you think he's stupid enough to go there? no, i think he's brilliant enough. i love the brilliant ones. they're all so desperate to get caught. - why? - appreciation! applause! at long last the spotlight. that's the frailty of genius, john, - it needs an audience. - yeah. this is his hunting ground. right here in the heart of the city. now that we know his victims were abducted, that changes everything. because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets, crowded places, but nobody saw them go. think! who do we trust, even though we don't know them? who passes unnoticed wherever they go? who hunts in the middle of a crowd? don't know. who? haven't the faintest. hungry? thank you, billy. 22 northumberland street. keep your eyes on it. he's not just going to ring the doorbell. he'd need to be mad. he has killed four people. ok. sherlock! anything on the menu, whatever you want, free. on the house, for you and for your date. - do you want to eat? - i'm not his date. this man got me off a murder charge. this is angelo. three years ago, i proved to lestrade, at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder, that angelo was in a different part of town, house-breaking. - he cleared my name. - i cleared it a bit. anything happening opposite? nothing. but for this man, i'd have gone to prison. - you didgo to prison. - i'll get a candle for the table. - it's more romantic. - i'm not his date! you may as well eat. we might have a long wait. thanks. people don't have arch-enemies. - i'm sorry? - in real life. there are no arch-enemies in real life. doesn't happen. doesn't it? sounds a bit dull. so who did i meet? what do real people have, then, in their...""real lives""? friends? people they know, people they like, people they don't like... - girlfriends, boyfriends. - yes, well, as i was saying, dull. you don't have a girlfriend, then? girlfriend? no, not really my area. mm. oh, right. do you have a boyfriend? which is fine, by the way. i know it's fine. - so you've got a boyfriend, then. - no. right. ok. you're unattached. like me. fine. good. john, um...i think you should know i consider myself married to my work and while i'm flattered, - i'm really not looking for any... - no, i'm...not asking. no. i'm just saying, it's all fine. good. thank you. look across the street. taxi. it's stopped. nobody getting in and nobody getting out. why a taxi? oh, that's clever. - is it clever? why is it clever? - that's him. - don't stare. - you're staring. we can't both stare. (car horn) sorry... - i've got the cab number. - good for you. right turn, one way, roadworks, traffic lights, bus lane, pedestrian crossing, left turn only, traffic lights. - oi! - sorry. (tyres squeal) come on, john... come on, john. we're losing him! this way. - no, this way! - sorry... police! open her up. (panting) no... teeth, tan. what, californian? la, santa monica. just arrived. - how could you possibly know that? - the luggage. first trip to london, right? going by your final destination and the cabbie's route. sorry, are you guys the police? yeah. everything all right? yeah. welcome to london. er, any problems, just let us know. basically just a cab that happened to slow down. - basically. - not the murderer. - not the murderer, no. - wrong country, good alibi. - as they go. - hey, where did you get this? - detective inspector lestrade? - yeah. i pickpocket him when he's annoying. you can keep that one, i've got plenty at the flat. - what? - nothing, just...""welcome to london."" (sniggers) - got your breath back? - ready when you are. that was ridiculous. that was the most ridiculous thing... i've ever done. - and you invaded afghanistan. - (they laugh) that wasn't just me. why aren't we back at the restaurant? they can keep an eye out. it was a long shot anyway. so what were we doing there? oh, just passing the time. and proving a point. - what point? - you. mrs hudson! dr watson willtake the room upstairs. says who? says the man at the door. (knocking) sherlock texted me. he said you forgot this. ah... er, thank you. thank you. sherlock, what have you done? - mrs hudson? - upstairs. what are you doing? i knew you'd find the case, i'm not stupid. you can't just break into my flat. you can't withhold evidence - and i didn't break in. what do you call this, then? it's a drugs bust. seriously? this guy - a junkie? - have you met him? - john... you could search this flat all day, you wouldn't find anything you could call recreational. - john, you probably want to shut up now. - but come on... - no... - what? - you? - shut up! - i'm not your sniffer dog. - no, anderson's my sniffer dog. anderson, what are you doing here on a drugs bust? - oh, i volunteered. - they all did. they're not strictly speaking on the drug squad, but they're very keen. - are these human eyes? - put those back! - they were in the microwave. - it's an experiment. keep looking, guys. or you could help us properly, and i'll stand them down. - this is childish. - well, i'm dealing with a child. sherlock, this is ourcase. i'm letting you in, but you do not go off on your own. clear? so you set up a pretend drugs bust to bully me? it stops being pretend if we find anything. i am clean! - is your flat? all of it? - i don't even smoke. neither do i. so let's work together. - we've found rachel. - who is she? jennifer wilson's only daughter. her daughter? why would she write her daughter's name? why? never mind that, we found the case. according to someone, the murderer has the case, and we found it in the hands of our favourite psychopath. not a psychopath, i'm a high-functioning sociopath. do your research. you need to bring rachel in to question her. ineed to question her. she's dead. excellent. how, when and why? is there a connection? there has to be. well, i doubt it, since she's been dead for 1 4 years. technically, she was never alive. rachel was jennifer wilson's stillborn daughter, 1 4 years ago. oh, that's... ...that's not right. how... why would she do that? why? why would she think of her daughter in her last moments? yep - sociopath, i'm seeing it now. she didn't think about her daughter. she scratched her name on the floor with her fingernails. she was dying. it took effort, it would have hurt. you said that the victims all took the poison themselves, that he makesthem take it. well, maybe he...i don't know, talks to them. maybe he used the death of her daughter somehow. but that was ages ago. why would she still be upset? not good? bit not good, yeah. if you were dying, if you'd been murdered, in your very last few seconds, what would you say? - ""please, god, let me live."" - use your imagination! i don't have to. yeah, but if you were clever, really clever. jennifer wilson running all those lovers - she was clever. she's trying to tell us something. isn't the doorbell working? your taxi's here, sherlock. - i didn't order a taxi. go away. - oh, dear. they're making such a mess. - what are they looking for? - it's a drugs bust, mrs hudson. but they're just for my hip. they're herbal soothers... shut up, everybody! don't move, don't speak, don't breathe. i'm trying to think. anderson, face the other way. you're putting me off. - what? my face is(?) - everybody quiet and still. - anderson, turn your back. - oh, for god's sake! your back, now, please! - come on, think. quick! - what about your taxi? (shouting) mrs hudson! oh... ah! she was clever. clever, yes! she's cleverer than you lot and she's dead. do you see? do you get it? she didn't lose her phone, she never lost it. she planted it on him. when she got out of the car, she knew that she was going to her death. she left the phone in order to lead us to her killer. - but how? - what do you mean, how? rachel! don't you see? rachel! oh... look at you lot. you're all so vacant. is it nice not being me? it must be so relaxing. - rachel is not a name. - then what is it? john, on the luggage, there's a label. e-mail address. er, jenny.pink@mephone.org.uk. she didn't have a laptop, which means she did her business on her phone. so it's a smartphone, it's e-mail enabled. so there was a website for her account. the username is her e-mail address, and all together now, the password is...? - rachel. - so we can read her e-mails. so what? anderson, don't talk out loud. you lower the iq of the whole street. we can do much more than that. it's a smartphone, it's got gps. which means if you lose it, you can locate it online. she's leading us to the man who killed her. - unless he got rid of it. - we know he didn't. - come on, come on. quickly! - sherlock, dear. this taxi driver... mrs hudson, isn't it time for your evening soother? get vehicles, get a helicopter. this phone battery won't last for ever. we'll just have a map reference, not a name. holmes: it's a start! sherlock... narrows it down from just anyone in london. - it's the first proper lead we've had. - sherlock... where is it? quickly, where? here. it's...in 22 1 baker street. how can it be here? how? maybe it was in the case when you brought it back - and it fell out somewhere. - and i didn't notice it? ididn't notice? watson: anyway, we texted him, and he called back. guys, we're also looking for a mobile somewhere here, belonged to the victim. who do we trust, even if we don't know them? who passes unnoticed wherever they go? who hunts in the middle of a crowd? (text message alert) - sherlock, are you ok? - what...? yeah, yeah... i'm fine. so, how can the phone be here? don't know. - i'll try it again. - good idea. where are you going? fresh air, just popping outside for a moment. won't be long. - are you sure you're all right? - i'm fine. taxi for sherlock holmes. i didn't order a taxi. doesn't mean you don't need one. you're the cabbie. the one who stopped outside northumberland street. it was you. not your passenger. see? no-one ever thinks about the cabbie. it's like you're invisible. just the back of an 'ead. proper advantage for a serial killer. - is this a confession? - oh, yeah. i'll tell you what else... if you call the coppers now, i won't run. i'll sit quiet, and they can take me down, i promise. why? - cos you're not going to do that. - am i not? i didn't kill those four people, mr holmes. i spoke to 'em... and they killed themselves. if you get the coppers now, i'll promise you one thing. i will never tell you what i said. no-one else will die, though, and i believe they call that a result. and you won't ever understand how those people died. what kind of result do you care about? if i wanted to understand... - ...what would i do? - let me take you for a ride. - so you can kill me too? - i don't want to kill you, mr holmes. i'm going to talk to you... ...and then you're going to kill yourself. (door opens and closes) (engine starts) he just got in a cab... it's sherlock. he just drove off in a cab. i told you, he does that. he bloody left again. we're wasting our time! i'm...calling the phone, it's ringing out. (phone rings) (phone keeps ringing) and if it's ringing, it's not here. - i'll try the search again. - does it matter? does any of it? he's just a lunatic and he'll always let you down. and you're wasting your time. all our time. ok, everybody... done here. how did you find me? oh, i recognised you. soon as i saw you chasing my cab. sherlock holmes! i was warned about you. i've been on your website too. brilliant stuff! loved it. who warned you about me? just someone out there who's noticed. who? who would notice me? - you're too modest, mr holmes. - i'm really not. got yourself a fan. tell me more. that's all you're going to know. in this lifetime. why did he do that? why did he have to leave? you know him better than i do. i've known him for five years and, no, i don't. so why do you put up with him? because i'm desperate, that's why. and because sherlock holmes is a great man, and i think one day, if we're very, very lucky, he might even be a good one. where are we? you know every street in london. you know exactly where we are. roland-kerr further education college. - why here? - it's open. cleaners are in. one thing about being a cabbie - you always know a nice quiet spot for a murder. i'm surprised more of us don't branch out. and you just walk your victims in? how? oh... dull. don't worry. it gets better. you can't make people take their own lives at gunpoint. i don't. it's much better than that. don't need this with you. cos you'll follow me. (beep) (continuous beeping) well, what do you think? it's up to you. you're the one who's going to die here. no, i'm not. that's what they all say. shall we talk? bit risky, wasn't it? took me away under the eye of about half a dozen policemen. they're not that stupid. and mrs hudson will remember you. you call that a risk? nah... this...is a risk. oh, i like this bit. cos you don't get it yet, do ya? but you're about to. i just have to do this... weren't expecting that, were ya? oh, you're gonna love this. - love what? - sherlock holmes...look at you! here in the flesh. that website of yours, your fan told me about it. my fan? you are brilliant. you are a proper genius. the science of deduction. now, that... is proper thinking. between you and me sitting here, why can't people think? don't it make you mad? why can't people just think? oh, i see... so you're a proper genius too. don't look it, do i? funny little man driving a cab. but you'll know better in a minute. chances are it'll be the last thing you everknow. ok, two bottles. explain. there's a good bottle and a bad bottle. you take the pill from the good bottle, you live. you take the pill from the bad bottle...you die. - both bottles are of course identical. - in every way. - and you know which is which. - of course iknow. - but i don't. - wouldn't be a game if you knew - you're the one who chooses. why should i? i've got nothing to go on. what's in it for me? i haven't told you the best bit yet. whatever bottle you choose, i take the pill from the other one. and then together... we take our medicine. i won't cheat. it's your choice. i'll take whatever pill you don't. didn't expect that, did you, mr holmes? this is what you did to the rest of them, - you gave them a choice? - and now i'm giving you one. you take your time. get yourself together. - i want your best game. - it's not a game, it's chance. i've played four times. i'm alive. it's not chance, mr holmes - it's chess. it's a game of chess, with one move... ...and one survivor. and this...this... is the move. did i just give you the good bottle or the bad bottle? you can choose either one. no, detective inspector lestrade - i need to speak to him. it's important. it's an emergency. er, left here, please. left here... you ready yet, mr holmes? - ready to play? - play what? it's a 50:50 chance. you're not playing the numbers - you're playing me. did i just give you the good pill or the bad pill? is it a bluff or a double bluff? - or a triple bluff? - it's still just chance. four people, in a row? it's not chance. - luck. - it's genius! i know how people think. i know how people think ithink. i can see it all like a map inside my head. everyone's so stupid, even you. or maybe god just loves me. either way, you're wasted as a cabbie. so... ...you risked your life four times just to kill strangers - why? time to play. oh, i am playing. this is my turn. there's shaving foam behind your left ear. nobody's pointed it out to you. traces of where it's happened before, so obviously you live on your own - there's no-one to tell you. but there's a photograph of children. the children's mother's been cut out. if she'd died, she'd still be there. the photograph's old, but the frame's new. you think of your children, but you don't get to see them. estranged father. she took the kids, but you still love them, and it still hurts. ah, but there's more. your clothes. recently laundered, but everything you're wearing is at least...three years old? keeping up appearances, but not planning ahead. and here you are on a kamikaze murder spree. what's that about? ah... three years ago. is that when they told you? told me what? - that you're a dead man walking. - so are you. you don't have long, though. am i right? aneurism. right in 'ere. any breath could be my last. and because you're dying, you've just murdered four people. i've outlived four people. that's the most fun you can have with an aneurism. no... no, there's something else. you didn't just kill four people because you're bitter. bitterness is a paralytic. love is a much more vicious motivator. somehow, this is about your children. oh... - you are good, in't ya? - but how? when i die, they won't get much, my kids. not a lot of money in driving cabs. - or serial killing. - you'd be surprised. surprise me. - i have a sponsor. - you have a what? for every life i take, money goes to my kids. the more i kill... the better off they'll be. you see? it's nicer than you think. who'd sponsor a serial killer? who'd be a fan of sherlock holmes? you're not the only one to enjoy a good murder. there's others out there just like you, except you're just a man. and they're so much more than that. what do you mean... more than a man? an organisation...what? there's a name that no-one says. and i'm not going to say it either. now, enough chatter. time to choose. sherlock! what if i don't choose either? i could just walk out of here. you can take a 50:50 chance, or i can shoot you in the head. funnily enough, no-one's ever gone for that option. i'll have the gun, please. are you sure? definitely. the gun. you don't want to phone a friend (?) the gun. i know a real gun when i see one. - none of the others did. - clearly. well, this has been very interesting. i look forward to the court case. just before you go, did you figure it out? which one's the good bottle? course. child's play. well, which one, then? which one would you have picked? just so i know whether i could have beaten you. come on! play the game. oh! interesting. so what do you think? shall we? really...what do you think? can you beat me? are you clever enough... to bet your life? (muffled) sherlock! i bet you get bored, don't you? i know you do. a man like you. so clever. but what's the point of being clever if you can't prove it? still the addict. but this...this is what you're really addicted to. you'll do anything... ...anything at all, to stop being bored. you're not bored now, are ya? isn't it good? (gunshot) (gasping) was i right? i was, wasn't i? did i get it right? ok...tell me this. your sponsor. who was it? the one who told you about me, my fan. i want a name. no... you're dying, but there's still time to hurt you. give me...a name. (gasps) a name! now! the name! moriarty! (mouths) (sirens wail) why have i got this blanket? they keep putting this blanket on me. - yeah, it's for shock. - i'm not in shock. yeah, but some of the guys want to take photographs. so, the shooter - no sign? cleared off before we got here. but a guy like that would have had enemies, i suppose. one of them could have been following him, but... we've got nothing to go on. oh, i wouldn't say that. ok. give me. the bullet they just dug out of the wall's from a handgun. a kill shot over that distance, from that kind of a weapon, that's a crack shot. but not just a marksman, a fighter. his hands couldn't have shaken at all, so clearly he's acclimatised to violence. he didn't fire until i was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principle. you're looking for a man probably with a history of military service and... nerves of steel... actually, do you know what? ignore me. - sorry? - ignore all of that. - it's just the, er...the shock talking. - where are you going? i just need to...talk about the...the rent. - i've still got questions. - oh, what now?! i'm in shock - look, i've got a blanket. - sherlock! - and... i just caught you a serial killer... more or less. ok. we'll pull you in tomorrow. off you go. erm...sergeant donovan's...just been explaining...everything. two pills... dreadful business, isn't it? dreadful. good shot. yes. yes, must have been. through that window. well, you'd know. need to get the powder burns out of your fingers. i don't suppose you'd serve time for this, but let's avoid the court case. - are you all right? - yes, of course i'm all right. - well, you have just killed a man. - yes, i... that's true, isn't it? but he wasn't a very nice man. - no. no, he wasn't, really, was he? - frankly, a bloody awful cabbie. (chuckles) that's true, he was a bad cabbie. you should have seen the route he took us to get here. stop! we can't giggle, it's a crime scene. stop it. - you're the one who shot him. - keep your voice down! sorry, it's just, erm...nerves, i think. sorry. you were going to take that damn pill, weren't you? course i wasn't. biding my time. knew you'd turn up. no, you didn't. that's how you get your kicks, isn't it? you risk your life to prove you're clever. - why would i do that? - because you're an idiot. - dinner? - starving. end of baker street, there's a good chinese. stays open till two. you can tell a good chinese by the bottom third of the door handle. sherlock...that's him, that's the man i was talking to you about. i know exactly who that is. so...another case cracked. how very public-spirited. though that's never really your motivation, is it? what are you doing here? as ever, i'm concerned about you. yes, i've been hearing about your ""concern"". always so aggressive. did it never occur to you that you and i belong on the same side? oddly enough...no. we have more in common than you'd like to believe. this petty feud between us is simply childish. people will suffer. and you know how it always upset mummy. iupset her? me? it wasn't me that upset her, mycroft. no. no, wait... mummy? who's mummy? mother. our mother. this is my brother, mycroft. putting on weight again? - losing it, in fact. - he's your brother? course he's my brother. - so he's not... - not what? - i don't know...criminal mastermind? - close enough. for goodness' sake, i occupy a minor position in the british government. he isthe british government, when he's not too busy being the british secret service or the cia on a freelance basis. good evening, mycroft. try not to start a war before i get home - you know what it does for the traffic. so, when you say you're concerned about him, you actually are concerned? yes, of course. it actually is a childish feud? he's always been so resentful. you can imagine the christmas dinners. yeah... no... god, no. i'd better, erm... hello again. - hello. - we met earlier on this evening. oh! - ok. good night. - good night, dr watson. - so, dim sum. - mmm! i can always predict the fortune cookies. - no, you can't. - almost can. you did get shot, though. - sorry? - in afghanistan. there was an actual wound. - oh. yeah, shoulder. - shoulder! i thought so. - no, you didn't. - the left one. - lucky guess. - i never guess. yes, you do. - what are you so happy about? - moriarty. - what's moriarty? - i've absolutely no idea. sir, shall we go? interesting, that soldier fellow. he could be the making of my brother... or make him worse than ever. either way, we'd better upgrade their surveillance status. grade 3 active. sorry, sir - whose status?"
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"why today? do you want to hear me say it? eighteen months since our last appointment. you read the papers? - sometimes. - and you watch telly? you know why i'm here. i'm here because... what happened, john? sher... you need to get it out. my best friend, sherlock, is dead. falls of the reichenbach. turner's masterpiece, thankfully recovered owing to the prodigious talent of mr sherlock holmes. a small token of our gratitude. diamond cufflinks. all my cuffs have buttons. - he means 'thank you - do i? - just say it. - thank you. back together with my family, after my terrifying ordeal. and we have one person to thank for my deliverance, sherlock holmes. - tie pin. i don't wear ties. - shh. peter ricoletti. number one on interpol's most wanted list since 1982. but we got him. and there's one person we have to thank for giving us the decisive leads, with all his customary diplomacy and tact. - sarcasm. - yes. we all chipped in. put the hat on! yeah, sherlock. put it on. just get it over with. boffin""? boffin sherlock holmes - everybody gets one. - one what? tabloid nickname. subo, nasty nick. shouldn't worry. i'll probably get one soon. page five, column six, first sentence. - why is it always the hat photograph? - ""bachelor john watson."" - what kind of hat is it, anyway? - bachelor? what the hell are they implying? - is it a cap? why has it got two fronts? - it's a deerstalker. ""frequently seen in the company of bachelor john watson."" how do you stalk a deer with a hat? what am i going to do, throw it? - ""confirmed bachelor john watson."" - is it like some sort of death frisbee? okay, this is too much. we need to be more careful. it's got? aps. ear flaps, it's an ear hat, john. what do you mean, more careful? i mean, this isn't a deerstalker now. it's a sherlock holmes hat. i mean that you're not exactly a private detective any more. - you're this far from famous. - it'll pass. it better pass. the press will turn, sherlock. they always turn. and they'll turn on you. - it really bothers you. - what? - what people say. - yes. about me. i don't understand. why would it upset you? just try to keep a low profile. find yourself a little case this week. stay out of the news. - that's your phone. - keeps doing that. so, did you just talk to him for a really long time? henry fishguard never committed suicide. bow street runners missed everything! pressing case, is it? they're all pressing till they're solved. put your key in there, please. excuse me, sir. any metal objects? keys, mobile phones? - go through. - thank you. - fancy a cuppa, then, mate? - yeah, why not? gilts at seven. dutch telecoms in freefall. thank you, harvey. what do you say? refuse them all parole and bring back the rope? let's begin. this is an emergency. please leave... sir, i'm going to have to ask you to leave. - sir, there's been a break-in. - not our division. you'll want it. the vault! hacked into the tower of bloody london's security? how? tell them we're already on our way. there's been another one. another break-in. bank of england! sir, security's down, sir. it's failing. - where is it now? - pentonville prison. no! no rush. i'll get it, shall i? - here. - not now, i'm busy. - sherlock. - not now. he's back. that glass is tougher than anything. not tougher than crystallised carbon. he used a diamond. - ready? - yes. let them through. thank you. i've got it. - remember... - yes. - remember... - yes. remember what they told you. - don't try to be clever... - no. and please, just keep it simple and brief. god forbid the star witness in the trial should come across as intelligent. intelligent, fine. let's give smartarse a wide berth. - i'll just be myself. - are you listening to me? - so today, standing outside... - is this the trial of the century... the trial of james moriarty... james moriarty, early today accused of attempting... of attempting to steal the crown jewels. at the old bailey we have reichenbach hero sherlock holmes... would you mind slipping your hand into my pocket? thanks. crown versus moriarty, please proceed to court 70. you're him. wrong toilet. - i'm a big fan. - evidently. i read your cases. follow them all. sign my shirt, would you? there are two types of fans. catch me before i kill again, type a. - what's type b? - your bedroom's just a taxi ride away guess which one i am? - neither. - really? no, you're not a fan at all. those marks on your forearm. edge of a desk. you've been typing in a hurry, probably. pressure on, facing a deadline. - that all? - there's a smudge of ink on your wrist and the bulge in your left jacket pocket. bit of a giveaway? the smudge is deliberate. it's to see if i'm as good as they say i am. oil-based. used in newspaper print. but drawn on with an index finger. your finger. journalist unlikely you get your hands dirty at the press. you put that there to test me. - wow! i'm liking you. - you mean i'd make a great feature. ""sherlock holmes, the man beneath the hat."" kitty. riley. - pleased to meet you. - no. i'm just saving you the trouble of asking. no, i won't give you an interview. no, i don't want the money. you and john watson. just platonic? can i put you down for a no there as well? there's all sorts of gossip in the press about you. sooner or later, you're going to need someone on your side. someone to set the record straight. you think you're the girl for that job, do you? i'm smart. and you can trust me. totally. smart? okay. investigative journalist. good. well, look at me and tell me what you see. if you're that skilful, you don't need an interview, you can just read what you need. no? okay, my turn. i look at you and i see someone who's still waiting for their first big scoop so that their editor will notice them. you're wearing an expensive skirt that has been re-hemmed twice. the only posh skirt you've got. and your nails, you can't afford to do them that often. i see someone who's hungry. i don't see smart. and i definitely don't see trustworthy, but i'll give you a quote, if you like. three little words. you repel me. - a consulting criminal. - yes. your words. can you expand on that answer? james moriarty is for hire. - a tradesman? - yes. but not the sort who'd fix your heating? no, the sort who'd plant a bomb or stage an assassination, but i'm sure he'd make a pretty decent job of your boiler. would you describe him as... - leading. - what? can't do that. you're leading the witness. he'll object and the judge will uphold. mr holmes! ask me how. how would i describe him? what opinion have i formed of him? did they not teach you this? mr holmes, we're fine without your help. how would you describe this man, his character? first mistake, james moriarty isn't a man at all. he's a spider. a spider at the centre of a web. a criminal web with a thousand threads and he knows precisely how each and every single one of them dances. and how long... no, no, don't... don't do that. that's really not a good question. - mr holmes! - how long have i known him? not really your best line of enquiry. we met twice, five minutes in total. i pulled a gun. he tried to blow me up. i felt we had a special something miss sorrel, are you seriously claiming this man is an expert? after knowing the accused for just five minutes? two minutes would have made me an expert. five was ample. mr holmes, that's a matter for the jury. really? one librarian, two teachers, two high-pressure jobs, probably the city. foreman's a medical secretary, trained abroad, judging by her short hair. - mr holmes... - seven are married and two are having an affair with each other, it would seem. and they've just had tea and biscuits. would you like to know who ate the wafer? mr holmes! you've been called here to answer miss sorrel's questions, not to give us a display of your intellectual prowess. keep your answers brief and to the point. anything else will be treated as contempt. do you think you could survive for just a few minutes without showing off? what did i say? i said, ""don't get clever."" i can't just turn it on and off like a tap. - well? - well what? you were there for the whole thing. up in the gallery, start to finish. like you said it would be. sat on his backside, never even stirred. moriarty's not mounting any defence. bank of england, tower of london, pentonville. three of the most secure places in the country and six weeks ago, moriarty breaks in, no one knows how or why. - all we know is... - he ended up in custody. don't do that. - do what? - the look. - look? - you're doing the look again. well, i can't see it, can i? - it's my face. - yes, and it's doing a thing. you're doing a ""we both know what's really going on here"" face. - well, we do. - no, i don't. which is why i find the face so annoying. if moriarty wanted the jewels, he'd have them. if he wanted those prisoners freed, they'd be out on the streets. the only reason he's still in a prison cell right now is because he chose to be there. somehow, this is part of his scheme. mr crayhill, can we have your first witness? your honour, we're not calling any witnesses. i don't follow. you've entered a plea of ""not guilty"". nevertheless, my client is offering no evidence. the defence rests. - ladies and gentlemen of the jury... - ladies and gentlemen of the jury... - james moriarty stands accused... - james moriarty stands accused of multiple counts of attempted burglary. crimes which, if he's found guilty, will elicit a very long custodial sentence and yet his legal team has... chosen to offer no evidence whatsoever to support their plea. i find myself in the unusual position of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly. you must find him guilty. guilty. you must find him guilty. coming back. that was six minutes. surprised it took them that long, to be honest. there was a queue for the loo. have you reached a verdict on which you all agree? not guilty. they found him not guilty. no defence and moriarty's walked free. sherlock? are you listening? he's out. you know he'll be coming after you. sher... most people knock. but then, you're not most people, i suppose. kettle's just boiled. johann sebastian would be appalled. - may i? - please. you know, while he was on his deathbed, bach, he heard his son at the piano playing one of his pieces. the boy stopped before he got to the end. and the dying man jumped out of his bed, ran straight to the piano and finished it. couldn't cope with an unfinished melody. neither can you. it's why you've come. but be honest, you're just a tiny bit pleased. - what? with the verdict? - with me. back on the streets. every fairy tale needs a good old-fashioned villain. you need me or you're nothing. because we're just alike, you and i. except you're boring. you're on the side of the angels. you got to the jury, of course. i got into the tower of london, you think i can't worm my way into 12 hotel rooms? cable network. every hotel bedroom has a personalised tv screen. and every person has their pressure point; someone that they want to protect from harm. easy peasy. so how are you going to do it? - burn me? - that's the problem. the final problem. have you worked out what it is yet? what's the final problem? i did tell you. but did you listen? how hard do you find it having to say ""i don't know""? - i don't know. - that's clever. that's very clever. awfully clever. speaking of clever, have you told your little friends yet? - told them what? - why i broke into all those places - and never took anything? - no. - but you understand. - obviously. off you go, then. you want me to tell you what you already know? no, i want you to prove that you know it. you didn't take anything because you don't need to. good. you'll never need to take anything ever again. very good. because? because nothing, nothing in the bank of england, the tower of london or pentonville prison could possibly match the value of the key that could get you into all three. i can open any door anywhere with a few tiny lines of computer code. no such thing as a private bank account now. they're all mine. no such thing as secrecy. i own secrecy. nuclear codes, i could blow up nato in alphabetical order. in a world of locked rooms, the man with the key is king. and honey, you should see me in a crown. you were advertising all the way through the trial. you were showing the world what you can do. and you were helping. big client list. rogue governments, intelligence communities. terror cells. they all want me. suddenly i'm mr sex. you can break any bank. what do you care about the highest bidder? i don't. i just like to watch them all competing. ""daddy loves me the best!"" aren't ordinary people adorable? well, you know. you've got john i should get myself a live-in one. - why are you doing all of this? - it must be so funny. you don't want money or power, not really. what is it all for? i want to solve the problem. our problem. the final problem. it's going to start very soon, sherlock. the fall. but don't be scared. failing's just like flying except there's a more permanent destination. i never liked riddles. learn to. because i owe you a fall, sherlock. i owe you. excuse me, i'm looking for mycroft holmes. would you happen to know if he's around at all? can you not hear me? yes, all right. anyone? anyone at all know where mycroft holmes is? i've been asked to meet him here. no takers. right. am i invisible? can you actually see me? thanks, gents. i've been asked to meet mycroft holmes. tradition, john our traditions define us. so total silence is traditional, is it? you can't even say ""pass the sugar""? three quarters of the diplomatic service and half of the government front bench all sharing one tea trolley? it's for the best, believe me. they don't want a repeat of 1972. - but we can talk in here. - you read this stuff? caught my eye. saturday, they're doing a big exposé. i'd love to know where she got her information. someone called brook. recognise the name? school friend, maybe? of sherlock's? but that's not why i asked you here. - who's that? - don't know him? - no. - never seen his face before? - um... - he's taken a flat in baker street, two doors down from you. i was thinking of doing a drinks thing for the neighbours. i'm not sure you'll want to. sulejmani. albanian hit squad. expertly trained killer, living less than 20 feet from your front door. well, it's a great location. - jubilee line's handy. - john... - what's it got to do with me? - dyachenko, ludmila. um, actually, i think i have seen her russian killer. she's taken the flat opposite. okay. i'm sensing a pattern here. in fact, four top international assassins relocate to within spitting distance of 221 b. anything you care to share with me? i'm moving? it's not hard to guess the common denominator, is it? you think this is moriarty? he promised sherlock he'd come back. if this was moriarty, he would be dead already. if not moriarty, then who? why don't you talk to sherlock if you're so concerned about him? god! don't tell me. too much history between us, john. old scores, resentments. nicked all his smurfs? broke his action man? finished. we both know what's coming, john. moriarty is obsessed, he's sworn to destroy his only rival. so you want me to watch out for your brother because he won't accept your help. if it's not too much trouble. - excuse me. - sorry. sherlock, there's something weird... - what's going on? - kidnapping. rufus bruhl, the ambassador to the us. - he's in washington, isn't he? - not him. his children. max and claudette. aged seven and nine. they're at st aldate's. posh boarding place down in surrey. school broke up. all the other boarders went home. just a few kids remained, including those two. the kids have vanished. the ambassador's asked for you personally. the reichenbach hero. isn't it great to be working with a celebrity? - it's all right. - miss mackenzie, house mistress. go easy. miss mackenzie. you're in charge of pupil welfare, yet you left this place wide open last night! what are you, an idiot, a drunk or a criminal? now, quickly, tell me! all the doors and windows were properly bolted. no one, not even me, went into their room last night. you have to believe me! i do. i just wanted you to speak quickly. miss mackenzie will need to breathe into a bag now. six grand a term, you'd expect them to keep the kids safe for you. so the other kids had all left on their holidays? they were the only two sleeping on this floor. absolutely no sign of a break-in. the intruder must have been hidden inside some place. show me where the brother slept. boy sleeps there every night gazing at the only light source, outside in the corridor. he'd recognise every shape, every outline. the silhouette of everyone who came to the door. okay! so? so someone approaches the door who he doesn't recognise. an intruder. maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon. what would he do in the precious few seconds before they came into the room? how would he use them, if not to cry out? this little boy, this particular little boy, who reads all those spy books. what would he do? he'd leave a sign. get anderson. linseed oil. not much use. doesn't lead us to the kidnapper. - brilliant, anderson. - really? yes, brilliant impression of an idiot. the floor. he made a trail for us the boy was made to walk ahead of them. - on tiptoe? - indicates anxiety. gun held to his head. the girl was pulled beside him, dragged sideways. he had his left arm cradled about her neck. that's the end of it. we don't know where they went from here. tell us nothing after all. you're right, anderson. nothing. except his shoe size, his height, his gait, his walking pace. having fun? starting to. maybe don't do the smiling. kidnapped children? how did he get past the cctv? if all the doors were locked. he walked in when they weren't locked. a stranger can't just walk into a school like that. anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment. yesterday, end of term, parents milling around, chauffeurs, staff. what's one more stranger among that lot? he was waiting for them. all he had to do was find a place to hide. - molly! - hello. i'm just getting out. - no you're not. - i've got a lunch date. - cancel it. you're having lunch with me. - what? need your help. it's one of your boyfriends, we're trying to track him down. - he's been a bit naughty. - it's moriarty. of course it's moriarty. jim actually wasn't even my boyfriend. we went out three times. i ended it. yes, and then he stole the crown jewels, broke into the bank of england and organised a prison break at pentonville. for the sake of law and order, i suggest you avoid all future attempts at a relationship, molly. oil, john. the oil in the kidnapper's footprint. it'll lead us to moriarty. all the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved. the sole of the shoe is like a passport. if we're lucky, we can see everything that he's been up to. i need that analysis. - alkaline. - thank you, john. - molly. - yes. glycerol molecule. what are you? what did you mean, ""i owe you""? you said, ""i owe you."" you were muttering it while you were working. nothing. mental note. you're a bit like my dad. he's dead. sorry. molly, please don't feel the need to make conversation. it's really not your area. when he was dying, he was always cheerful, he was lovely. except when he thought no one could see. - i saw him once. he looked sad. - molly... you look sad. when you think he can't see you. are you okay? don't just say you are, because i know what that means, looking sad when you think no one can see you. - you can see me. - i don't count. what i'm trying to say is that if there's anything i can do, anything you need, anything at all, you can have me. no, i just mean... i mean... if there's anything you need. it's fine. but what could i need from you? nothing. i don't know. but you could probably say thank you, actually. thank you. i'm just going to go and get some crisps. do you want anything? it's okay. i know you don't. - well, actually, maybe i'll... - i know you don't. sherlock? this envelope was in her trunk. - there's another one. - what? on our doorstep. found it today. yes, and look at that. look at that. exactly the same seal. - bread crumbs. - it was there when i got back. a little trace of bread crumbs, hardback copy of fairy tales. two children led into the forest by a wicked father follow a little trail of bread crumbs. that's hansel and gretel. what sort of kidnapper leaves clues? the sort that likes to boast. the sort that thinks it's all a game. he sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me. all fairly tales need a good old-fashioned villain. the fifth substance. it's part of the tale. the witch's house. the glycerol molecule. what's that? it's used in making chocolate. this fax arrived an hour ago. what have you got for us? we need to find a place in the city where all five of these things intersect. chalk, asphalt, brick dust, vegetation... what the hell is this? chocolate? i think we're looking for a disused sweet factory. we need to narrow that down. a sweet factory with asphalt? no, no, no. too general. need something more specific, chalk, chalky clay. that's a far thinner band of geology. brick dust. building site. bricks from the 19505. there's thousands of building sites in london! - i've got people out looking. - so have i! homeless network. faster than the police. far more relaxed about taking bribes. john. rhododendron ponticom. matches. - addlestone. - what? there's a mile of disused factories between the river and the park. - it matches everything. - come on. come on! you, look over there. look everywhere. spread out, please. spread out! this was alight moments ago. they're still here! sweet wrappers. what's he been feeding you? hansel and gretel. - mercury. - what? the papers, they're painted with mercury. lethal. - the more of the stuff they ate... - it was killing them. it's not enough to kill them on its own. taken in large enough quantities, eventually it would kill them. he didn't need to be there for the execution. murder by remote control. he could be 1,000 miles away. the hungrier they got, the more they ate, the faster they died. neat. sherlock. over here! we've got you, don't worry. right, then. the professionals have finished if the amateurs want to go in and have their turn. now, remember that she's in shock and she's just seven years old so... anything you can do to... - not be myself. - yeah. might be helpful. claudette, i... no, no, i know it's been hard for you, claudette. listen to me. get out! - makes no sense. - kid's traumatised. something about sherlock reminds her of the kidnapper. what's she said? hasn't uttered another syllable. - and the boy? - no, he's unconscious. still in intensive care. well, don't let it get to you, i always feel like screaming when you walk into a room. in fact, so do most people. come on. brilliant work you did, finding those kids from just a footprint. - it's really amazing. - thank you. unbelievable. you okay? thinking. this is my cab, you get the next one. - why? - you might talk. what the hell is this? chocolate? we're looking for a disused sweet factory. gel' out'! problem? nation, this is stunning eveningwear - sent from us here at london... - could you turn that off, please? as you can see, the set comprises of a beautiful... can you turn this off? accompanied by four... hello. are you ready for the story? this is the story of sir boast-a-lot. a footprint, that's all he has. a footprint. yeah, well, you know what he's like, csi baker street. well, our boys couldn't have done it. well, that's why we need him. he's better. - that's one explanation. - and what's the other? sir boast-a-lot was the bravest and cleverest knight at the round table. but soon, the other knights began to grow tired of his stories about how brave he was and how many dragons he'd slain. and soon they began to wonder, are sir boast-a-lot's stories even true? only he could have found that evidence. no. and then the girl screams her head off when she sees him, a man she has never seen before. unless she had seen him before. - what's your point? - you know what my point is, you just don't want to think about it. so one of the knights went to king arthur and said ""i don't believe sir boast-a-lot's stories."" he's just a big old liar who makes things up to make himself look good. you're not seriously suggesting he's involved, are you? i say we have to entertain the possibility. and then even the king began to wonder... but that wasn't the end of sir boast-a-lot's problem. no. that wasn't the final problem. the end. stop the cab. stop the cab! what was that? what was that? no charge. look out! thank you. sherlock! that is him. it's him. sulejmani or something. mycroft showed me his files. a big albanian gangster who lives two doors down from us. he died because i shook his hand. - what do you mean? - saved my life, but he couldn't touch me. why? four assassins living right on our doorstep. they didn't come here to kill me. they have to keep me alive. i've got something that all of them want. but if one of them approaches me... the others kill them before they can get it. all of the attention is focused on me. there's a surveillance web closing in on us right now. so, what have you got that's so important? we need to ask about the dusting. precise details. in the last week, what's been cleaned? - well, tuesday i did your lino... - no, in here. this room. this is where we'll find it. any break in the dust line. you can put back anything but dust. dust is eloquent. - what's he on about? - i don't know. - cameras. we're being watched. - what? cameras? here? i'm in my nightie. - no, inspector. - what? the answer is no. - you haven't heard the question. - you want to take me to the station. just saving you the trouble of asking. - sherlock... - the scream? yeah. who was it? donovan? i bet it was donovan. am i somehow responsible for the kidnapping? moriarty's smart. he planted that doubt in her head. that little nagging sensation you got to have to be strong to resist. you can't kill an idea, can you? not once it's made a home... there. - will you come? - one photograph, that's his next move. moriarty's game. first the scream, then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning. he wants to destroy me inch by inch. it is a game, lestrade, and not one i'm willing to play. give my regards to sergeant donovan. - he'll be deciding. - deciding? whether to come back with a warrant and arrest me. - you think? - standard procedure. should have gone with him. - people will think... - i don't care what people think. you'd care if they thought you were stupid or wrong. no, that would just make them stupid or wrong. sherlock, i don't want the world believing you're... that i am what? a fraud - you're worried they're right. - what? - you're worried they're right about me. - no. that's why you're so upset, you can't even entertain the possibility that they might be right, you're afraid that you've been taken in as well. no, i'm not. moriarty is playing with your mind, too. can't you see what's going on? - no, i know you're for real. - a hundred percent? nobody could fake being such an annoying dick all the time. - sherlock holmes? - yes, sir. that bloke that's been in the press? i thought he was some sort of private eye? - he is. - we've been consulting with him, that's what you're telling me? not used him on any proper cases, though, have we? well, one or two. twenty or 30. - what? - look, i'm not the only senior officer - who did this... - shut up. an amateur detective given access to all sorts of classified information? and now he's a suspect in a case? - with all due respect... - you're a bloody idiot, lestrade. now, go and fetch him in, right now. do it! proud of yourselves? what if it's not just this case? what if he's done this to us every single time? so, i've still got some friends on the force. it's lestrade. says they're all coming over here right now. queuing up to slap on the handcuffs, every single officer you ever made feel like a tit. which is a lot of people. yoo hoo! sorry, am i interrupting? some chap delivered a parcel. i forgot. marked perishable. i had to sign for it. funny name. german. like the fairy tales. burnt to a crisp. what does it mean? i'll go. - sherlock. - excuse me, mrs hudson. we need to talk to you! don't barge in like that. - have you got a warrant? have you? - leave it, john. me? but... sherlock holmes, i'm arresting you on suspicion of abduction and kidnapping. - it's all right, john. - he's not resisting. no, it's not all right. this is ridiculous. get him downstairs, now. - you know you don't... - don't try to interfere or i shall arrest you, too. - you done? - i said it. - first time we met. - don't bother. solving crimes won't be enough. one day, he'll cross the line. now ask yourself, what sort of man would kidnap those kids just so he can impress us all by finding them? - donovan? that's our man? - sir. yes, sir. looked a bit of a weirdo, if you ask me. often are, these vigilante types. what are you looking at? are you all right, sir? joining me? yeah. apparently it's against the law to chin the chief superintendent. bit awkward, this. there's no one to bail us. i was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape. all units to 2-7. - what? - all units to two... ladies and gentlemen, will you all please get on your knees? - now would be good! - do as he says! just so you're aware, the gun is his idea, - i'm just, you know... - my hostage! hostage, yes, that works. that works. so what now? doing what moriarty wants. becoming a fugitive. run. get after him, lestrade! take my hand. now people will definitely talk. - the gun! - leave it. sherlock, wait! we're going to need to coordinate. go to your right. go to your right. everybody wants to believe it. that's what makes it so clever a lie that's preferable to the truth. all my brilliant deductions were just a sham. no one feels inadequate. sherlock holmes is just an ordinary man. what about mycroft? he could help us. if he thinks i want a reconciliation? now's not really the moment. sherlock, sherlock! we're being followed. i knew we couldn't outrun the police. it's not the police. it's one of our new neighbours from baker street. let's see if he can give us some answers. where are we going? we going to jump in front of that bus tell me what you want from me. tell me! he left it at your flat. - who? - moriarty. what? the computer key code. of course, he's selling it. the programme he used to break into the tower. he planted it when he came around. it's a game-changer. it's a key. it could break into any system and it's sitting in our flat right now. that's why he left that message telling everyone where to come. ""get sherlock."" we need to get back into the flat and search. cid will be camped out. why plant it on you? it's another subtle way of smearing my name, now i'm best pals with all those criminals. yeah, well, have you seen this? a kiss and tell. some bloke called rich brook. who is he? too late to go on the record? congratulations. the truth about sherlock holmes. the scoop that everybody wanted and you've got it. bravo. i gave you your opportunity. i wanted to be on your side, remember? you turned me down. and then, lo and behold, someone turns up and spills all the beans. how utterly convenient. who is brook? come on, kitty. no one trusts the voice at the end of a telephone. there were all those furtive little meetings in cafés, those sessions in the hotel room where he gabbled into your dictaphone. how do you know that you can trust him? a man turns up with the holy grail in his pocket. what were his credentials? darling, they didn't have any ground coffee, so i just got normal. you said that they wouldn't find me here. - you said that i'd be safe here. - you are safe, richard. i'm a witness. he wouldn't harm you in front of witnesses. so, that's your source? moriarty is richard brook? of course he's richard brook, there is no moriarty, there never has been. - what are you talking about? - look him up. rich brook, an actor sherlock holmes hired to be moriarty. doctor watson, i... i know you're a good man. don't... don't... don't hurt me. no, you're moriarty! he's moriarty! we've met, remember? you were going to blow me up! i'm sorry, i'm sorry. he paid me. i needed the work. - i'm an actor, i was out of work... - sherlock, you'd better explain, - 'cause i am not getting this. - i'll be doing the explaining. in print. it's all here. conclusive proof. you invented james moriarty, your nemesis. invented him? invented all the crimes, actually. and to cap it all, you made up a master villain. - don't be ridiculous. - ask him, he's right here! just ask him! - tell him, richard. - no, for god's sake, - this man was on trial. - yes, and you paid him. paid him to take the rap. promised you'd rig the jury not exactly a west end role, but i'll bet the money was good. but not so good he didn't want to sell his story. i am sorry. i am, i am sorry. so, this is the story that you're going to publish? the big conclusion of it all, moriarty is an actor? he knows i am. i have proof. i have proof, show him. can you show them something? yeah, show me something. i'm on tv, i'm on kids tv. i'm the storyteller. i'm the storyteller. it's on dvd. just tell him. it's all coming out now. it's all over. just tell them, just tell them. tell him! it's all over... no! no! don't you touch me. don't you lay a finger on me. stop it, stop it now! no, no, don't hurt me. - don't let him get away! - leave him alone! no, no, no, he'll have backup. do you know what, sherlock holmes? i look at you now and i can read you. and you repel me. can he do that? completely change his identity? - make you the criminal? - he's got my whole life story. that's what you do. you sell a big lie. you wrap it up in a truth to make it palatable. it's your word against his. he's been sowing doubt into people's minds for the last 24 hours. there's only one thing he needs to do to complete his game and that's to... sherlock? there's something i need to do. - what, can i help? - no, on my own. you're wrong, you know. you do count. you've always counted and i've always trusted you. but you were right. i'm not okay. tell me what's wrong. molly, i think i'm going to die. - what do you need? - if i wasn't everything that you think i am, everything that i think i am, would you still want to help me? what do you need? you. she has really done her homework, miss riley. there's things that only someone close to sherlock could know. have you seen your brother's address book lately? there's two names, yours and mine. and moriarty didn't get this stuff from me. - john... - so, how does it work, then? your relationship? you go out for a coffee now and then? you and jim? your own brother and you blabbed about his entire life to this maniac? - i never intend... i never dreamt... - this, see, this... is what you were trying to tell me, isn't it? watch his back, 'cause i've made a mistake. how did you meet him? people like him, we... know about them, we watch them. but james moriarty the most dangerous criminal mind the world has ever seen, and in his pocket's the ultimate weapon, a key code. a few lines of computer code that can unlock any door. and you abducted him? to try and find the key code. - interrogated him for weeks. - and? he wouldn't play along. he just sat there, staring into the darkness. the only thing that made him open up... i could get him to talk. just a little. but... in return, you had to offer him sherlock's life story. so there's one big lie, sherlock's a fraud. but people will swallow it because the rest of it is true. moriarty wanted sherlock destroyed, right? and you have given him the perfect ammunition. john. i'm sorry. please. tell him, would you? got your message. the computer code is key to this. if we find it, we can use it, beat moriarty at his own game. - what do you mean, use it? - he's used it to create a false identity. so we can use it to break into the records and destroy richard brook. and bring back jim moriarty again. somewhere in 221 b, somewhere, on the day of the verdict, he left it hidden. - what did he touch? - an apple, nothing else. - did he write anything down? - no. yeah, speaking. what? what happened? is she okay? my god. right. yes, i'm coming. - what is it? - paramedics. - mrs hudson's been shot. - what? how? well, probably one of the killers you managed to attract. jesus. - jesus! she's dying, sherlock. let's go. - you go, i'm busy. - busy? - thinking, i need to think. you need to... doesn't she mean anything to you? you once half killed a man because he laid a finger on her. - she's my landlady. - she's dying, you machine. sod this. sod this. you stay here if you want. on your own. alone is what i have. alone protects me. no, friends protect people. well. here we are at last. you and me, sherlock. and our problem, the final problem, stayin' alive. so boring, isn't it? it's just... staying... all my life, i've been searching for a distraction and you were the best distraction and now i don't even have you. because i've beaten you. and you know what? in the end, it was easy. it was easy. now i've got to go back to playing with the ordinary people. and it turns out you're ordinary, just like all of them. well. did you almost start to wonder if i was real? did i nearly get you? richard brook. nobody seems to get the joke. - but you do. - of course. attaboy. rich brook in german is reichenbach. the case that made my name. just trying to have some fun. good, you got that, too. beats like digits. every beat is a one, every rest is a zero. binary code. that's why all those assassins tried to save my life. it was hidden on me, hidden inside my head. a few simple lines of computer code that can break into any system. told all my clients. - last one to sherlock is a sissy. - yes, but now that it's up here, i can use it to alter all the records. i can kill rich brook and bring back jim moriarty. no, no, no, no, no, this is too easy. this is too easy. there is no key, doofus! those digits are meaningless. they're utterly meaningless. you don't really think a couple of lines of computer code are going to crash the world around our ears? i'm disappointed. i'm disappointed in you. - ordinary sherlock. - but the rhythm... partita no 7. thank you, johann sebastian bach. - then how did you... - now, how did i break into the bank, to the tower, to the prison? daylight robbery. all it takes is some willing participants. i knew you'd fall for it. that's your weakness. you always want everything to be clever. now, shall we finish the game? one final act. glad you chose a tall building. nice way to do it. do it? do... do what? yes, of course. my suicide. genius detective proved to be a fraud. i read it in the paper, so it must be true. i love newspapers. fairy tales. and pretty grim ones, too. god, john, you made me jump. is everything okay now with the police? has, um, sherlock sorted it all out? my god. taxi! taxi! no, no, no, no, police! thanks, mate. thanks a lot. i can still prove that you created an entirely false identity. just kill yourself, it's a lot less effort. go on. for me. please? you're insane. you're just getting that now? whoa! okay. let me give you a little extra incentive. your friends will die if you don't. - john? - not just john. everyone - mrs hudson? - everyone. - lestrade? - three bullets, three gunmen, three victims. there's no stopping them now. unless my people see you jump. you can have me arrested. you can torture me. you can do anything you like with me. but nothing's going to prevent them from pulling the trigger. your only three friends in the world will die. unless... unless i kill myself, complete your story. you've got to admit, that's sexier. and i die in disgrace. of course, that's the point of this. look, you got an audience now. off you pop... go on. i told you how this ends. your death is the only thing that's going to call off the killers. i'm certainly not going to do it. would you give me one moment, please? one moment of privacy. please? of course. what? what is it? what did i miss? you're not going to do it? so the killers can be called off, then, there's a recall code or a word or a number. i don't have to die... if i've got you. you think you can make me stop the order? - you think you can make me do that? - yes. so do you. sherlock, you're big brother and all the king's horses couldn't make me do a thing i didn't want to. yes, but i'm not my brother, remember? i am you. prepared to do anything. prepared to burn. prepared to do what ordinary people won't do. you want me to shake hands with you in hell? i shall not disappoint you. nah. you talk big. nah. you're ordinary. you're ordinary, you're on the side of the angels. i may be on the side of the angels, but don't think for one second that i am one of them. no. you're not. i see. you're not ordinary. no. you're me. you're me. thank you, sherlock holmes. thank you. bless you. as long as i'm alive, you can save your friends. you've got a way out. well, good luck with that. yes, sir. thank you. bye. hello? - john. - hey, sherlock, you okay? turn around and walk back the way you came. - no, i'm coming in. - just do as i ask! - please. - where? - stop there. - sherlock? okay, look up, i'm on the rooftop. god. i... i... i can't come down, so we'll just have to do it like this. - what's going on? - an apology. - it's all true. - what? everything they said about me. i invented moriarty. why are you saying this? i'm a fake. - sherlock. - the newspapers were right all along. i want you to tell lestrade... i want you to tell mrs hudson. and molly. in fact, tell anyone who will listen to you that i created moriarty for my own purposes. okay, shut up, sherlock, shut up. the first time we met. the first time we met, you knew all about my sister. - right? - nobody could be that clever. you could. i researched you. before we met, i discovered everything that i could to impress you. it's a trick. just a magic trick. no, all right, stop it now. no, stay exactly where you are. - don't move. - all right. keep your eyes fixed on me. - please, will you do this for me? - do what? this phone call, it's; um... it's my note. it's what people do, don't they? leave a note? leave a note when? - goodbye, john. - no, don't. sherlock! sherlock. sherlock. sherlock. i'm a doctor. let me come through. let me come through, please. no, he's my friend. he's my friend. please. please, let me just jesus, no... god, no. god. there's stuff that you wanted to say, - but didn't say it. - yeah. say it now. no. i'm sorry, i can't. there's all of this stuff. all the science equipment. i left it all in boxes. i don't know what needs doing. i thought i'd take it to a school. - would you... - i can't go back to the flat again. not at the moment. i'm angry. it's okay, john. there's nothing unusual in that. that's the way he made everyone feel. all those marks on my table and the noise. firing guns at half past one in the morning. - yeah. - bloody specimens in my fridge. imagine, keeping bodies where there's food. - yes. - and the fighting. drove me up the wall with all his carryings on. yeah, listen, i'm not actually that angry, okay? okay, i'll leave you alone to, you know... um... right, you... you told me once... that you weren't a hero um... there were times i didn't even think you were human but let me tell you this, you were the best man and the most human human being that i've ever known and no one will ever convince me that you told me a lie, okay? so... there. i was... i was so alone. and i owe you so much. please, there's just one more thing right? one more thing. one more miracle, sherlock, for me. don't be... dead. would you, just for me, just stop it? stop this."

i am trying to effectuate a successful merger with my husband. fuchsia, i don't have time for this. i've been trying to make this deal work for the last six weeks! and totally ignoring me! you care more about this agency than you do your own wife! well, one thing's for certain, evian. it's time for decisive action. quebec... come into my office, will you? now. i've been keeping an eye on you, quebec. on my work? really? no. on you. have a seat. this isn't about business, is it? no. it's about you. you're like me, quebec. i can tell. you've got an empty void in your lonely life. i do?

the picture is so much better. plus you get hbo and everything. it would really improve the quality of your life. yes. yes! no! leon thinks cable is frivolous. what? cnn, frivolous? c-span, frivolous? the weather channel, frivolous? ha. i think not, and furthermore, would fuchsia hesitate because evian thought something was frivolous? no. or would she take... decisive action. decisive action? yes. oh. hi. i'm abel with the cable. i'm sure you are. ha ha! i mean, hi. come in. i'm glad you're here. tomorrow starts in an hour. what?

no problem. great. great. uh, will it take long? nah. i'll run a line in from the street, do the first installation... bing, bang, boom. the second one usually takes longer, but it's more fun, if you know what i mean. uh-huh. so now, male... into female. input... output... finished. you're all hooked up. got quite a tool there. it's huge. it's not the size of the tool, ma'am. it's how you use it. you certainly know how to use it. how many installations have you done in one day?

oh, my husband, take me. oh, evian. oh. day four, mr. cottontail. vital signs stable, brain waves normal, heart functioning. what did i tell you about coming in when the light's on? only emergencies. oh, this is an emergency. remember this, leon? i wore it on our wedding night. you did? well, not all the time. you did remove it. take a night off, leon. i have something so special planned. i can't. i'm so close. watch tv. read a book or something. i don't wanna watch tv. i want to be with you. you can't. i'm at a critical stage. so am i! janet, look at this. ew! is he dead? no. he's in a condition of thermodynamic stasis. it's never been done before. he's been this way for days. i think i can hold him another week. you care more about holding bugs bunny here than you do about holding me. come on, leon. oh, come on. i'll make you so happy. you'll be so glad. janet, i can't. i can't do this. now look what you've done! you did that on purpose, didn't you? now i have to go to the hospital to get more plasma! oh, leon, please. can't it wait? no. i can't lose him. i need it tonight. you need it! what about me, huh? what about what i need? what about me? door's open. hi. i'm having problems with my reception, abel. i've tried the knobs, but i'm not getting anything. well, i'm pretty good at playing with knobs. maybe you've just got a bad connection. well, then take a look, would you? look at that. you've got snow. you're like me, abel. i can tell. you've got an empty void in your lonely life. i do? you see, you and i, we're like two lost travelers in a dark, loveless, frozen world. nah. i've got plenty of heat in my van. company's good about that. you didn't need to call me. it's simple. your male and female connectors have come unplugged. i hate when that happens. i just need to screw these back together. don't bother. the tv doesn't need to be hooked up. i do. well, your equipment is in perfect condition. i'd like to see you again, abel. i'd like to get more premium channels. i guess you can say i'm cable ready. sure. you've already got the box, i just have to plug 'em in. have anything to say, leon? yeah. what happened to the tv? that's all? i'm on the verge of greatness. back to work. call the tv repairman in the morning. good idea, leon. good idea. what seems to be the problem now, ma'am? vertical hold. how about a rerun of last night's show? i hate reruns. let's think of today more as an encore presentation. what about your husband? don't worry about him. he's at... janet? the front door! oh, god! oh, shit. janet? up here, leon, in the bedroom. what the hell's going on here? who the hell are you? i'm the cable man. i'm just here to check out some of the equipment. you told me to call him. it seems your work's causing some interference. i'd say that's what caused the problem in the first place. didn't you just install cable the other day? but i had to come back. we had to work out some of the kinks. ah ha ha ha! turn that off. what are you doing home in the middle of the afternoon? i've taken a leave of absence from the hospital until this research is finished. oh, that means you'll be here from now on. right. round-the-clock, down in the lab. shit. as soon as i've perfected my anesthetic, i'll be there for you. but right now, i'm just not able. you can say that again. come here. come here. no, no, no, no. come here. see, he'll be down there for hours. we can always tell when he's about to come up because the red light goes off. you can escape through the garden. it's perfect, love. day 7... mr. cottontail remains stable in suspension. cells still normal. evian. take me. here. now. no, fuchsia. there's someone else in my life now. evian! how could that be? you've been locked up in the men's house of detention for 2 weeks. oh, my god... mm, cable. it really has improved the quality of my life. oh. lights out. out through the garden. take your time. bye. bye. how's it going, hon? day 10, janet. mr. cottontail is resting comfortably. i hope you're not too lonely. i'm managing. day 15... subject still normal. the most difficult operation now seems possible. very good. very good, sweetie pie. can you stop an avalanche from thundering wildly down a mountain? no. can you stop a waterfall from crashing... over a cliff? no... yes. yes. ah. yes. oh... yes... yes. yes! oh, yes! i can see stockholm now, the nobel prize! janet! janet! you're going to be very proud of me! i want you, abel. i want your body. give me all of it, every inch of it. i want your body. i want your body, janet. give it to me. yes! give it to me. yes! ohh! give me your body now. give it to me. yes! no... yes! no! take my body. what can i do? what can i do? divorce her and leave her? no. no. that would be too easy. give it to me. yes! i've got to hurt her, hurt her as she hurt me. yes. yes. first on mr. cottontail, now on humans... or should i say... sub-humans? day eight... the subjects appear to be normal. the extended anesthesia is allowing the procedure to far exceed my hopes. the extended anesthesia is allowing the procedure to far exceed my hopes. day 15... subjects in place, should awaken momentarily. hi. hi. how long have we been asleep?

would you like me to? no, i wouldn't. you see what i mean about fears. how about you, lucy? are you afraid, too? i... i think adele's right. i've managed to keep this husband of mine fooled so far, so why take the risk of giving myself away? what makes you think you have him fooled? well, i don't know. have i, darling? maybe you ought to let miles hypnotize you and we'll all find out. shall i? the risk is all yours, my dear mrs. pryor. all right. wonderful! wonderful, darling. i'm willing to chance it if will is. well, how do we start? well, if you're serious, let's get you in a nice, comfortable chair near a light. yes, this one will do. darling, i think you're very brave to do this. i don't know about this. oh, there's nothing to worry about. all i want is your concentration. there. oh, this is going to be wonderful. comfortable? yes. relaxed? completely. good. now... i want you to concentrate on this light. just stare at it. that's right. just the light. it's soft and steady. and it burns, warm and glowing. softly, moving now. slowly, slowly. slowly. floating in space. free of this room as now you are free. free, you and the light and the sound of my voice. can you hear my voice? yes. good. we're alone now, you and i. and whatever i ask you, you must answer truthfully. will you do that? yes. you mean she's hypnotized already? i can't believe it. speak to her. lucy. lucy. lucy. she doesn't hear you or see you. lucy, wake up. i'm afraid she doesn't feel your touch either. let's go back in time. way back, through the years. back to when you were a child. nine years old. you're nine years old now. what school do you attend? miss ewing's classes. and what are you studying there? oh! reading, writing, arithmetic and drawing. and what do you want to do when you grow up? hmm... marry. let's come back to the present. back through the years. five years, 10, 15 years. you're grown-up now, and you are married. you've been married for five years. and your name is mrs. lucy pryor. my name is dora. what is your full name? dora evans, and it please thee, sir. what on earth is she talking about? where do you live, dora? i abide at number 43, king's street, philadelphia. and what year is this? in the year of our blessed lord, 1853. 1800... quiet. dora evans, you live in philadelphia, and this is 1853. tell me, are you married? do you have a husband? i... i beg of thee, sir, pray, do not make me tell. very well. we'll talk about something else. who is the president of the united states? the honorable benjamin pierce. have you ever met him or seen him? oh, indeed. he was here but a short while ago, addressing a convocation of the society of friends on the question of slavery. what do you like to do? you like to sew, you like to work in your garden? oh, i have a lovely garden which doth pleasure me greatly. would you like to show me your garden? my garden? down there, by the elder trees. and my nasturtiums and ferns. and over there, the old mill wheel turns. hmm. and here are my rose arbor. my rose arbor. what about the rose arbor? it was there i made my decision. i took me stealthy to the house and entered the parlor, where sat my good husband. he did not see me enter. i came up behind him and quickly... no! lucy! will! i've never seen anyone dead before. when i came out of the hypnosis and saw will lying there... and you have no recollection of the killing whatsoever? no, they told me later. the thompsons and that dreadful man, miles farnham. one can't commit an act contrary to one's own nature. someone you love, it's not possible. i still can't believe he's dead. believe me, i'm sorry to put you through this, mrs. pryor. but try to understand, it is necessary. there has to be a coroner's inquest, and i must have the facts correct. yes, i understand. you say you became this dora evans? yes, i was wearing strange clothes. i remember i had large hands and there was hate. i felt this hate in her and i couldn't resist. i was drawn to her, dreading something, something she wanted, something she willed me to do. i think that's enough for now. yes. why don't you go along home and try to get some rest, mrs. pryor. i'll let you know when the coroner's inquest is going to take place. oh, it's this way. thank you for your cooperation. well, we've had some odd ones, but this... all right, if you'll come in now, please. mr. farnham, mr. sherman. farnham. how do you do? just there, if you will, mr. farnham. cigarette? thank you. got some news this morning i think might interest you. i put through a call to the philadelphia historical society. it seems there actually was a dora evans. born september 2nd, 1828. married, no children. on june 10th, 1853, dora evans stabbed her husband with a pair of pruning shears. yes, she killed him. is it possible that this dead woman, dora evans, could influence the living? could she actually compel mrs. pryor to kill her husband? obviously, she did. unless, of course, you think mrs. pryor murdered her husband. it's your suggestion, not mine. well, i'm just trying to find out what all this questioning is about. your case, mr. burke, if there is such a case, isn't against lucy pryor. i'm afraid, if anyone's to blame for his death, it's dora evans. and you can't very well try her, now, can you? well, as she's been dead over 100 years, i'm inclined to agree with you. yes. well, if there's nothing else? yes, thank you for your time, mr. farnham. my secretary did get your home address and phone number, didn't he? yes, he did. and if i can help, please call up. i will let you know when the coroner's inquest will take place. goodbye. bye. what do you make of it? it's curious. of course, there's absolutely no case against her. no jury in the world would convict her. no, of course they wouldn't. a professor farnham to see you, ma'am. oh? ask him to come in, alma. hello, mrs. pryor. did i disturb you? i hope not. but i had a sudden impulse to look in and see how you were. won't you sit down? thank you. oh, would you mind if i have a drink? thank you. you know, i had a talk with that burke fellow today after you left. and a fascinating thing came up. did he tell you? tell me what? about dora evans. she actually existed. oh, a long time ago. and it seems that she killed her husband. with, of all things, a pair of pruning shears. that's rather poor taste at a time like this, don't you think? you mean you didn't know about it? professor farnham, unless there is some reason for this conversation... my dear mrs. pryor, i have decided to cut myself in. cut yourself in. on what? let's not pretend anymore, mrs. pryor. you need me. i beg your... please don't argue with me, mrs. pryor. i'm the hypnotist, remember? it's my profession. now, a little judicious searching through any good library, i'm sure most anyone could've come up with a dora evans. ah, but so few would conceive the brilliance of using it as a peg on which to hang a murder. that's a monstrous accusation. but it would be perfect, wouldn't it? i'm the one person who can uphold your story. with my sworn statement, this would never get beyond the coroner's inquest. without it, my dear mrs. pryor, i'm afraid you might find yourself in one of those sordid tabloid trials. alma! alma! professor farnham is leaving. now get out of my house. get out of my house. all right, please. this coroner's board of hennepin county is now in session. the clerk will enter the opening data. convening board is now in session to determine death, cause and circumstance of said will pryor. killed october 13th, 1958, at his residence in glan mallow hill. doctor malcolm edderberry, examining physician. death certificate signed 1:45 am. morning of october 13th, 1958. mr. farnham, this is key testimony you're giving here, since we're dealing in a somewhat mystical area, and you being an accredited... what is this here? meta... metaphysician. thank you. metaphysician. now, this transference, as you refer to it, this exchange of body and spirit with dora evans, is that a possibility? not only a possibility, gentlemen, a fact. i can cite a dozen other instances such as the one that mrs. pryor went through. it was a transitive exchange with a person long deceased. glen, if you don't mind, i'd like to question the witness. well, that's your prerogative. mr. farnham, i'd like you to tell the coroner's board something about this vast experience you've had. specifically, the year 1938, nassau county, new york. i have here a police report of an indictment against a miles john farnham in may of that year on charges of fraud and malpractice. it wasn't proven! i was exonerated. the whole thing was a mistake. i will prove that mr. farnham, or professor farnham as he likes to call himself, is not an accredited hypnotist. and that mrs. lucy pryor was not in a state of hypnosis at the time of the stabbing of her husband. that's not true, she was under hypnosis. i verified that. we have only your word. now, i submit these police reports on the character of this man's word. i disacknowledge his claims of professionalism, and i ask that this case be brought before people's court for grand jury trial. i object to his inference. what does he mean i'm not accredited? it's an inexact science. we don't carry graduation diplomas around in our hip pockets. this lady was under hypnosis. if you don't believe me, if anyone has any doubts, with mrs. pryor's permission, i'll prove it to you right here and now. well, i hardly think that mrs. pryor... no, i don't mind, mr. garson. where do you want me, professor? in that chair, please. would you raise your veil? may i please have complete silence. now, you remember the light in the living room? yes. i want you to concentrate on this light. soft, steady light. warm and glowing. floating in space. free in this room. free, as you are free. you and the light and the sound of my voice. can you hear my voice? yes. you're going back in time now. years are slipping by. what is your name? my name is dora evans. and it please thee, sir. my garden is there by the elder trees. and just here is my rose arbor. it was there i made my decision. i took me stealthy to the house. i submit this lady is in deep hypnosis. you can have her examined by any doctor you may choose to verify this. i guarantee, she is not accountable for any act she performs in this condition. she is under the direct control of the spirit of dora evans. the spirit of a woman dead for over 100 years. i came up behind him and... quickly! hurry up! well, end of a pretty good case against mrs. lucy pryor. come on, darling, just try not to think. we'll get you home and into bed right away. george, get the car, will you? all right. darling, sit there quietly. i'll only be a moment. oh, mr. burke, would you keep an eye on her? i'm going across the street and get some smelling salts. certainly. thank you. may i have a drink of water? thank you. do you have a cigarette? thanks. i needed this. lucy, the car is downstairs, dear. mrs. pryor. there's no one anywhere near us. i've no recording devices, no one can ever verify what you say at this moment. you're free now. free of me and the courts. so just to satisfy my curiosity, did you plan the whole thing? wouldst not thee like to know? what do you think of this? he regressed me and then only brought me halfway back. i... good heavens, everyone's asleep. that last commercial must have hypnotized them. it put the entire audience under. that didn't do any good. since i can't wake you up, i can only leave you with this post-hypnotic suggestion. next week when you awaken, you will feel compelled to tune in again when we promise to bring you another story and three less soporific commercials. good night. subtitles by: drvvr"
1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"this is just a routine checkup. it seems to me she could take my blood pressure with a tire gauge. if you don't care to watch the details of my physical examination, perhaps you would enjoy perusing my doctor's collection of x-rays of prominent personalities. the following is a true and full account and hereby sworn to by me, paul brett, attorney-at-law. some time ago, my records will show the exact date, i was just preparing to leave my office, when my secretary came in with an unusual request. can you take a minute to see a miss cannon? no appointment, no reference. what does she want? who is she? advice, i imagine. she's young and attractive and a lot more tense than she lets on. i thought you just said she didn't have any references. she doesn't. oh. i didn't think mine counted for anything. well, when you get through housecleaning, send her in. will you come in, miss cannon? won't you sit down, miss cannon? thank you for seeing me, mr. brett. i'm afraid i'm urgently in need of legal advice. well, let me give you some right away. lie to anybody you want to, except your lawyer. isn't that a little premature, mr. brett? i haven't told you anything yet. well, you said your name was miss cannon. you are wearing a wedding ring. my maiden name was cannon. if you don't mind, we'll leave it there. this interview seems to be getting off to a bad start. why did you come to see me? i was told you're the best criminal lawyer in town. thank you. now, suppose you tell me what your problem is, we'll decide if we want to proceed. what does a person do if she knows a murder has been committed? well i would say that if for any reason she can't report it to the police, she should confide in her lawyer. before my marriage, i was a private nurse. i had a patient named mary hughes. she was bedridden, and had been that way for several months. naturally, she was inclined to be irritable and demanding. i thought you'd forgotten about my medicine. oh, mrs. hughes, you really didn't think that, did you? you were just hoping i'd forget it. well, you were late with my lunch today. you haven't been eating very much lately. i thought i'd try to make your tray a bit more appetizing. here we are. take this. it's vile. i'll never get used to it. here's your chaser. and your sleeping pills. i'll try to make you more comfortable now. anything else you'll be wanting tonight? yes, my husband. tell him i want to see him. i'll send him right up, mrs. hughes. goodnight. is mr. hughes still in the study? yes, he is, miss cannon. thank you, miss simpson. goodnight. come in. mrs. hughes is waiting to say goodnight, sir. of course. nurse, does she seem any better to you? doctor says she's making progress. good. mr. hughes, i wonder if she mightn't do better with another nurse. why do you say that, miss cannon? your wife doesn't seem to like me and i find that a patient does better if she likes a nurse. if you'd care to change, i'd certainly understand. please, believe me, miss cannon, i know it's been difficult for you. my wife is not an easy patient. - it's not your fault. - but if she'd be happier with another... we've already had two other nurses. no one has done more than you have. i know that and i'm sure that in her heart, my wife knows it too. please, will you stay? of course i will. good. hello, doctor, this is miss cannon. can you come over immediately, sir? - yes, she seems to be in a coma. - mary. mary. i understand, sir. five cc's. - i'll do my best. thank you, doctor. - what's happening? what's happened, nurse? she's had a relapse. the doctor will be over in a few minutes. mary, we're right here. the death of his wife seemed to leave mr. hughes in a state of collapse. he had no other family, so i stayed on until the day after the funeral. miss cannon, i can never repay you for everything you've done. especially this last week for me. this is just a slight token. mr. hughes, i can't accept this. this is for much more than you owe me. miss cannon, you've earned every penny of it, believe me. - no, i couldn't, really. - please. i'd like you to take it. thank you. i hope we don't lose touch with each other completely. thanks again for everything. goodbye, mr. hughes. bye. - alice? - yeah? - do you want an apple? - yeah. how do you like this shade? it's pretty bright. it looks as though your toes are on fire. you know, speaking of painting toes, i think i'm going to paint this apartment. red. well, anything but this hospital white. don't you think we've got enough of that... hello. oh, hello, yes, she's right here. just a minute. your service. hello? yes. mr. gilbert hughes? i have the address. all right, thank you. i can see the apartment's not going to get painted. i hope it's nothing serious. he's was so upset about his wife's death, he probably hasn't been taking care of himself properly. i had a patient like that once, he jumped off a bridge. mr. hughes! then, you're not sick. no. no, not me. won't you please come in? is it your housekeeper, then? - no. - i hope there hasn't been a mistake. my service said that you needed a nurse here. may i? please forgive me for using a subterfuge, but i couldn't think of any other way of asking you. asking me what? well, i have two tickets to a concert this evening. i thought you might enjoy having them. - well... - this is absurd, isn't it? what i really want to say is, would you like to go to the concert with me? yes. wha ? you mean, all i needed to do was ask you? that's all. well, then, shall i pick you up at your place about 7:00 tonight? - will that be all right? - certainly, that'll be fine. well... oh, uh... don't you want my address? i feel like a rat leaving you with all this. why don't you wait till tomorrow when i'm off and can help? don't think i wouldn't, but i have a better offer. - huh. one guess, gilbert hughes. - mmm-hmm. he offered to come and help me today. what's with you two? the way you toss and turn at night, you're making all the motions of a lovesick cow. oh, now really, alice. he's just a lonesome man who needs companionship. oh, don't give me that. a concert is companionship, a dinner is a flirtation, but painting this room, honey, that's love. i think he's serious about you. get out of here or you're gonna be docked an hour's pay. - oh! - oh! hello, mr. hughes. good afternoon. i was just leaving. hail and farewell. i hope i didn't frighten her away. men don't frighten alice. - i see you've started without me. - mmm-hmm. hmm. i like the color. uh, alice picked it up. i want you to wear this because i don't want you to ruin your new suit. oh. how did you know my size? oh, i'm just clever about things like that. well, where do you want me to start? well, i figure this is your territory right over here. there's your paint and your brush. mmm-hmm. it was nice of you to come and help me today. well, i particularly wanted to see you today. i'm... i'm going away. i'm closing the house. it's rather unexpected, isn't it? well, i... i only decided today, but it's... it's been building up for weeks. i just can't stand it any longer. can't stand what? well, living alone in that big house. i spend so much time by myself and it isn't good, so i'm going away. where? i don't know. - how long will you be gone? - well, i... i hadn't thought about it. but, would you consider coming with me? - i mean... - what do you mean? oh! what a terrible mess i've made of it. have you ever received a more ridiculous, clumsy proposal of marriage? hmm? frankly, i really can't say i have. well, when we've finished painting, may i try again? uh-huh. that's a very charming story, mrs. hughes, but it seems to have gotten away from your original point, which was murder. but i haven't finished yet. i believe my husband murdered his first wife. you see, right from the start, i knew she shouldn't have died. she was making progress. well, possibly you have a feeling of guilt. but, then isn't that perfectly normal in any young, dedicated nurse? i did everything possible for her. nevertheless, she died. yes, but nothing you've told me so far proves she was murdered. what evidence have you to support such a conclusion? it began after our honeymoon. the moment we returned to that house, he seemed different. he'd be on guard, watching for something. it's hard to put into words. he was withdrawn, difficult to reach. well, i would like to meet your new boyfriend. i'll tell you what, i'll check with gilbert and let you know about tomorrow night. all right, alice, bye. - who was that? - alice. she wants us to come to a party tomorrow night. oh, you know how i feel about that girl. i've asked you repeatedly not to see her or talk to her. please refuse for both of us. besides, i'd much rather spend our evenings at home. just the two of us. but we haven't been anywhere since we've been back. don't you like our home? yes, of course. but... it would do us good to get out. we don't even go to movies or concerts anymore. aren't you happy here? but, gilbert, you won't let me see any of my old friends. - i really can't go on this way. - why not? i don't understand. - good morning, sir. mail. - good morning, miss simpson. would you like some more hot coffee? no, thank you, miss simpson. thank you. my mail is just ads and bills. i hope yours is more interesting, my dear. it's just a letter from a former patient. we don't write often, but we keep in touch. a man? yes. an elderly man. i like his wife as much as i do him. they just discovered i'm married and they'd like to know what to give me for a present. please tell them you have everything you need, my dear. anything wrong, darling? gilbert? dear? here, baby, drink this, then you'll go back to sleep. yes, i know you took some earlier, but this is doctor's orders. he said you'd have another dose tonight. that's fine. that's fine, mary. see, he shouldn't have given her the medicine. he never did. that was my job. it's a very difficult situation, mrs. hughes. you see, there's only your word for it, that he said anything at all in his sleep. it's gonna be impossible to get confirmation of that. but i'm certain he killed her. that may be true, but... we'd have to have more positive or further proof before we could do anything legally. i can't go on living this way. i can't sleep, he's watching me every minute. why do you suppose he married me? has it ever occurred to you that his marriage to you might have been a kind of insurance policy? what do you mean? suppose there were further inquiries into his first wife's death, you couldn't testify against him. as you know, a wife can't testify against her husband. what am i going to do? does he have any idea at all that you overheard him talking in his sleep? i don't know. but if he ever finds out, he'll kill me. earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, but the spirit has returned to god who gave it. as we have born the image of the earthly, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly, cherishing memories that are forever sacred sustained by a faith that is stronger than death. we commit to the earth all that is mortal of this, our friend, in the hope of the resurrection, and the life of the world to come. my deepest sympathies on the death of your husband, mrs. hughes. thank you. at the coroner's inquest, the verdict was returned that hughes had committed suicide while the balance of his mind was disturbed. mrs. hughes was a rich woman now, and she asked me to act for her in settling up the estate. well, i would say, you have no financial worries for the rest of your life. gilbert did love me. he never intended to harm me. when i think of all the terrible things i said... don't think about that now. why did he kill himself? remorse, probably, over having done away with his first wife. he did, didn't he? well, of course. well, then, i suppose we'll never be able to prove it. no, i suppose not. have you decided what you're gonna do about selling the house? what do you think i should do? well, why don't you take your time and think about it for a while? an important case, hmm? very important. i think. right now i don't really know. all right, i could let my client go to jail. i don't think he'd like that. yeah, but i don't like him coming between me and my wife. all right, then i'll... i'll go sit way on the other side of the room and you can go back to work. you can work now. oh, i'm sorry. no, you're not. you love to demonstrate your power over me. you know what i've discovered this past month since we've been married? mmm-mmm. if you had been born 200 years ago, you would've been hanged as a witch. all right. i'll be a good girl, go up to bed and you can get back to your books. i'll be along in a few minutes. drink this, mrs. hughes. drink it. another dose. drink it. drink this, mrs. hughes, then you can go back to sleep. mrs. hughes, i know you took some earlier, but you have to have another dose. drink it. the foregoing as i've related it is exactly as my wife told it to me. and i know now that she lied. she gave mary hughes the overdose of medicine that killed her. and hughes did not commit suicide, but was poisoned by her so that she could get his money. i have no reason to believe that, having gotten away with two profitable murders, she would stop at a third. now i must not permit either a glance or a word to give me away. for if she ever suspects that i overheard her talking in her sleep she will certainly kill me. mrs. hughes made one fatal mistake. killing her husband and his first wife was one thing, but when she killed a lawyer, the police simply wouldn't stand for it. it's all very reassuring. this is all of tonight's program. next week, we... he'll be back in a minute. ...shall be back with another story. until then, goodnight."

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"{\an8}- who are you? - jim moriarty. {\an8}bye. consulting criminal. i have loved this, this little game of ours. - people have died. - that's what people do! i will stop you. if you don't stop prying... i'll burn you. i will burn the heart out of you. catch you later. no, you won't. sorry, boys. i'm so changeable. it is a weakness with me, but to be fair to myself, it is my only weakness. you can't be allowed to continue. you just can't. i would try to convince you but everything i have to say has already crossed your mind. probably my answer has crossed yours. do you mind if i get that? no, please. you've got the rest of your life. hello? yes, of course it is. what do you want? say that again! say that again and know that if you're lying to me, i will find you and i will skin you. wait. sorry. wrong day to die. did you get a better offer? you'll be hearing from me, sherlock. so if you have what you say you have, i will make you rich. if you don't. i'll make you into shoes. what happened there? someone changed his mind. the question is, who? well, now, have you been wicked, your highness? yes, miss adler. - what are you typing? - a blog. - about? - us. - you mean me. - why? well, you're typing a lot. right, then. so, what have we got? my wife seems to be spending - a very long time at the office. - boring. i think my husband - might be having an affair. - yes. she's not my real aunt, she's been replaced. i know she has. - i know human ash. - leave. we are prepared to offer any sum of money you care to mention - for the recovery of these files - boring! we have this website, it explains the true meaning of comic books, 'cause people miss a lot of the themes. but then all the comic books started coming true. interesting. ""geek interpreter"", what's that? - that's the title. - what does it need a title for? do people actually read your blog? where do you think our clients come from? i have a website. in which you enumerate 240 different types of tobacco ash. nobody's reading your website. right, then, dyed blonde hair, no obvious cause of death except for these speckles, whatever they are. for god's sakes! - what? - ""the speckled blonde""? they wouldn't let us see grandad when he was dead. is that 'cause he'd gone to heaven? people don't really go to heaven when they die, they're taken to a special room and burned. sherlock... there was a plane crash in dusseldorf yesterday. - everyone dead. - suspected terrorist bomb. - we do watch the news. - you said ""boring"" and turned over. well, according to the flight details, this man was checked in on board. inside his coat he's got a stub from his boarding pass, napkins from the flight, even one of those special biscuits. here's his passport, stamped in berlin airport. so this man should have died in a plane crash in germany yesterday, but instead he's in a car boot in southwark. lucky escape. - any ideas? - eight so far. okay, four ideas. maybe two ideas. no, no, no, don't mention the unsolved ones. people want to know you're human. - why? - because they're interested. - no, they're not. why are they? - look at that. one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-five. - sorry, what? - i reset that counter last night. this blog has had nearly 2,000 hits in the last eight hours. this is your living, sherlock, not 240 different types of tobacco ash. two hundred and forty-three. so what's this one? - ""bellybutton murders""? - ""the navel treatment""? there's a lot of press outside, guys. well, they won't be interested in us. yeah, that was before you were an internet phenomenon. couple of them specifically wanted photographs of you two. for god's sake! john. cover your face and walk fast. still, it's good for the public image, big case like this. i'm a private detective, the last thing i need is a public image! hello. i think it's time, don't you? dear! thumbs? the door was... the door was... boys! you've got another one! tell us from the start, don't be boring. hey, are you okay? excuse me! are you all right? sir, phone call for you. carter. have you heard of sherlock holmes? - who? - well, you're about to meet him now. this is your case, it's entirely up to you, this is just friendly advice, but give sherlock five minutes on your crime scene and listen to everything that he has to say. and as far as possible, try not to punch him. okay. sir, this gentleman says he needs to speak to you. yes, i know. sherlock holmes. john watson. are you set up for wi-fi? you realise this is a tiny bit humiliating? it's okay, i'm fine. now, show me to the stream. i didn't really mean for you. look, this is a six. there's no point in my leaving the flat for anything less than a seven, we agreed. now, go back, show me the grass. - when did we agree that? - we agreed it yesterday. stop. closer. i wasn't even at home yesterday, i was in dublin. it's hardly my fault you weren't listening. shut up! do you just carry on talking when i'm away? i don't know, how often are you away? nam show me the car that backfired. it's there. that? the one that made the noise, yes? yeah. if you're thinking gunshot, there wasn't one. he wasn't shot; he was killed by a single blow to the back of the head from a blunt instrument; which then magically disappeared, along with the killer. it's got to be an eight, at least. you've got two more minutes, they want to know more about the driver. forget him, he's an idiot. why else would he think himself a suspect? i think he's a suspect. - pass me over. - all right, but there's a mute button and i will use it. up a bit! i'm not talking from down here! okay. just take it, take it. having driven to an isolated location and successfully committed a crime without a single witness, why would he then call the police and consult a detective? fair play? he's trying to be clever. it's over-confidence. did you see him? morbidly obese, the undisguised halitosis of a single man living on his own. the right sleeve of an internet porn addict and the breathing pattern of an untreated heart condition, low self-esteem, tiny iq and a limited life expectancy and you think he's an audacious criminal mastermind? don't worry, this is just stupid what did you say? heart what? - go to the stream. - what's in the stream? - go and see. - sherlock! you weren't answering your doorbell. his room's through the back, get him some clothes. - who the hell are you? - sorry, mr holmes... - sherlock, what's going on? - you're coming with us. i've lost him. i don't know what... - dr watson? - yeah. - it's for you. - okay, thanks. no, sir, the helicopter. please, mr holmes, where you're going you'll want to be dressed. i know exactly where i'm going. - are you wearing any pants? - no. okay. at buckingham palace. right. i am seriously fighting an impulse to steal an ashtray. what are we doing here, sherlock? seriously, what? - i don't know. - here to see the queen? apparently, yes. just once can you two behave like grownups? we solve crimes, i blog about it and he forgets his pants. i wouldn't hold out too much hope. i was in the middle of a case, mycroft. what, the hiker and the backfire? i glanced at the police report, a bit obvious, surely? transparent. time to move on, then. we are in buckingham palace, at the very heart of the british nation. sherlock holmes, put your trousers on! - what for? - your client. and my client is? illustrious, in the extreme. and remaining, i have to inform you, entirely anonymous. - mycroft. - harry. may i just apologise for the state of my little brother? a full-time occupation, i imagine. and this must be dr john watson, formerly of - the fifth northumberland fusiliers? - hello, yes. my employer is a tremendous fan of your blog. - your employer? - particularly enjoyed the one - about the aluminium crutch. - thank you. and mr holmes the younger, you look taller in your photographs. i take the precaution of a good coat and a short friend. mycroft, i don't do anonymous clients. i'm used to mystery at one end of my cases, both ends is too much work. good morning. this is a matter of national importance. grow up! - get off my sheet! - or what? - or i'll just walk away. - i'll let you. boys, please. not here. who is my client? take a look at where you're standing and make a deduction. you are to be engaged by the highest in the land. now, for god's sake! put your clothes on! i'll be mother. and there is a whole childhood in a nutshell. my employer has a problem. a matter has come to light of an extremely delicate and potentially criminal nature and in this hour of need, dear brother, - your name has arisen. - why? we have a police force of sorts, even a marginally secret service. why come to me? people do come to you for help, don't they, mr holmes? not to date anyone with a navy. this is a matter of the highest security and therefore of trust. you don't trust your own secret service? naturally not. they all spy on people for money. i do think we have a timetable. yes, of course. what do you know about this woman? nothing whatsoever. then you should be paying more attention. she's been at the centre of two political scandals in the last year and recently ended the marriage of a prominent novelist, by having an affair with both participants separately. you know i don't concern myself with trivia. who is she? irene adler; professionally known as the woman. - professionally? - there are many names for what she does, she prefers ""dominatrix"". - dominatrix. - don't be alarmed. - it's to do with sex. - sex doesn't alarm me. how would you know? she provides, shall we say, recreational scolding for those who enjoy that sort of thing and are prepared to pay for it. these are all from her website. and i assume this adler woman has some compromising photographs? you're very quick, mr holmes. hardly a difficult deduction. photographs of whom? a person of significance to my employer. we'd prefer not to say any more at this time. you can't tell us anything? i can tell you it's a young person. a young female person. - how many photographs? - a considerable number, apparently. do miss adler and this young female person - appear in these photographs together? - yes, they do. and i assume in a number of compromising scenarios? an imaginative range, we are assured. john, you might want to put that cup back in your saucer now. - can you help us, mr holmes? - how? - will you take the case? - what case? pay her, now and in full. as miss adler remarks in her masthead, know when you are beaten. she doesn't want anything she got in touch, she informed us that the photographs existed, she indicated that she had no intention to use them to extort either money or favour. a power play. a power play with the most powerful family in britain. now, that is a dominatrix. ooh, this is getting rather fun, isn't it? sherlock... - where is she? - in london, currently. - she's staying... - text me the details, i'll be in touch by the end of the day. do you really think you'll have news by then? no, i think i'll have the photographs. one can only hope you're as good as you seem to think. i'll need some equipment, of course. anything you require, i'll have it sent over. - can i have a box of matches? - i'm sorry? or your cigarette lighter, either will do. - i don't smoke. - no, i know you don't, but your employer does. we have kept a lot of people successfully in the dark about this little fact, mr holmes. i'm not the commonwealth. and that's as modest as he gets. pleasure to meet you. late rs! okay, the smoking, how did you know? the evidence was right under your nose, john, as ever you see - but do not observe. - observe what? the ashtray. kate? we're going to have a visitor. i'll need a bit of time to get ready. - a long time? - ages. what are you doing? i'm going into battle, john, i need the right armour. - no. - nah. - works for me. - everything works on you. - so, what's the plan? - we know her address. - we just ring her doorbell? - exactly. just here, please. you didn't even change your clothes. then it's time to add a splash of colour. - are we here? - two streets away, but this will do. - for what? - punch me in the face. shade? - blood. - punch you? yes, punch me, in the face. didn't you hear me? i always hear ""punch me in the face"" when you're speaking, - but it's usually sub-text. - for god's sakes! thank you, that was, that was... okay, i think we're done now, john. you want to remember, sherlock, i was a soldier. - i killed people. - you were a doctor! i had bad days! - what are you going to wear? - my battledress. ooh, lucky boy. - hello? - um, sorry to disturb you. um, i've just been attacked. um, and i think they, they took my wallet and, um, and my phone. um, please, could you help me? i can phone the police if you want. thank you, thank you. could you, please? er; would you, would you mind if i just waited here, just until they come? thank you, thank you so much. thank you. i saw it all happen. it's okay, i'm a doctor. - now, have you got a first aid kit? - in the kitchen. please. - thank you. - thank you. hello, sorry to hear that you've been hurt. i don't think kate caught your name? i'm so sorry, i'm... it's always hard to remember an alias when you've had a fright. isn't it? there now, we're both defrocked. - mr sherlock holmes. - miss adler, i presume? look at those cheekbones. i could cut myself slapping that face. would you like me to try? right, this should do it. i've missed something, haven't i? please, sit down. or if you'd like some tea, i can call the maid. - i had some at the palace. - i know. clearly. i had a tea, too, at the palace. if anyone's interested. do you know the big problem with a disguise, mr holmes? however hard you try, it's always a self-portrait. you think i'm a vicar with a bleeding face? no, i think you're damaged, delusional and believe in a higher power. in your case, it's yourself. and somebody loves you. if i had to punch that face, i'd avoid your nose and teeth too. could you put something on, please? er, anything at all, a napkin? why? are you feeling exposed? i don't think john knows where to look. no, i think he knows exactly where. i'm not sure about you. if i want to look at naked women, i borrow john's laptop. - you do borrow my laptop. - i confiscate it. well, never mind, we've got better things to talk about. now, tell me, i need to know. how was it done? - what? - the hiker with the bashed-in head, how was he killed? that's not why i'm here. no, no, no, you're here for the photographs, but that's never going to happen. and since we're here just chatting anyway... that story's not been on the news yet, how do you know about it? i know one of the policemen. well, i know what he likes. and you like policemen? i like detective stories. and detectives. brainy's the new sexy. position of the car the position of the car relative to the hiker at the time of the backfire, that and the fact that the death blow was to the back of the head, that's all you need to know. okay, tell me, how was he murdered? he wasn't. - you don't think it was murder? - i know it wasn't. - how? - the same way that i know the victim was an excellent sportsman, recently returned from foreign travel and that the photographs i'm looking for are in this room. okay, but how? - so, they are in this room. - thank you. john, man the door, let no one in. two men alone in the countryside, several yards apart and one car. i... i thought you were looking for the photos now. no, no, looking takes ages, i'm just going to find them, but you're moderately clever and we've got a moment, so let's pass the time. two men, a car and nobody else. driver's trying to fix his engine. getting nowhere. and the hiker is taking a moment, looking at the sky. watching the birds? any moment now, something's going to happen. - what? - the hiker's going to die. no, that's the result. what's going to happen? - i don't understand. - well, try to. why? because you cater to the whims of the pathetic and take your clothes off to make an impression. stop boring me and think. it's the new sexy. - the car is going to backfire. - there's going to be a loud noise. - so what? - noises are important. noises can tell you everything. for instance... thank you. on hearing a smoke alarm, a mother would look towards her child. amazing how fire exposes our priorities. i really hope you don't have a baby in here. all right, john, you can turn it off now. i said you can turn it off now. give me a minute. thank you. you should always use gloves with these things, you know. heaviest oil deposit is always on the first key used, that's quite clearly a three, but after that the sequence is almost impossible to read. i see from the make that it's a six-digit code. it can't be your birthday, no disrespect, but clearly you were born in the '80s and 8's barely used, - so... - i'd tell you the code right now, but you know what? i already have. think. hands behind your head, on the floor, keep it still! - sorry, sherlock. - miss adler, on the floor! don't you want me on the floor too? no, sir, i want you to open the safe. american. interesting. why would you care? - sir, the safe, now, please. - i don't know the code. we've been listening, she said she told you. well if you've been listening, you'll know she didn't. i'm assuming i missed something. from your reputation, i'm assuming you didn't, mr holmes. for god's sake, she's the one who knows the code, ask her! yes, sir, she also knows the code that automatically calls the police and sets off the burglar alarm. - i've learned not to trust this woman. - mr holmes doesn't... shut up! one more word out of you, just one, and i will decorate that wall with the insides of your head. that, for me, will not be hardship. mr archer, at the count of three, shoot dr watson. - what? - i don't know the code. - one. - i don't know the code. - two. - she didn't tell me, i don't know it! i'm prepared to believe you, any second now. - three! - no, stop! thank you, mr holmes. open it, please. vatican cameos! - do you mind? - not at all. - he's dead. - thank you. you were very observant. - observant? - i'm flattered. - don't be. - flattered? there'll be more of them, they'll be keeping an eye on the building. - we should call the police. - yes. - on their way. - for god's sake! shut up, it's quick. check the rest of the house, see how they got in. well, that's the knighthood in the bag. and that's mine. all the photographs are on here, i presume? i have copies, of course. no, you don't. you'll have permanently disabled any kind of uplink or connection. unless the contents of this phone are provably unique, you wouldn't be able to sell them. who said i'm selling? well, why would they be interested? whatever's on the phone, it's clearly not just photographs. that camera-phone is my life, mr holmes. i'd die before i let you take it. it's my protection. - sherlock! - it was. - must have come in this way. - clearly. it's all right, she's just out cold. well god knows, she's used to that. there's a back door. better check it, dr watson. sure. you're very calm. well, your booby trap did just kill a man. he would have killed me. it was self-defence in advance. what...? what is that? what... give it to me. now. give it to me. - no. - give it to me. - no. - for goodness' sake! drop it. i said drop it! thank you, dear. now, tell that sweet little posh thing the pictures are safe with me. they're not for blackmail, just for insurance. besides, i might want to see her again. no, no, no, no, no, no it's been a pleasure, don't spoil it. this is how i want you to remember me, the woman who beat you. goodnight, mr sherlock holmes. - jesus! what are you doing? - he'll sleep for a few hours. make sure he doesn't choke on his own vomit, it makes for a very unattractive corpse. what's this? what have you given him? sherlock? he'll be fine. i've used it on loads of my friends. sherlock, can you hear me? you know, i was wrong about him. he did know where to look. for what? what are you talking about? the key-code to my safe. - what was it? - shall i tell him? my measurements. got it! no, don't get up. i'll do the talking. so the car's about to backfire and the hiker, he's staring at the sky. no, you said he could be watching birds, but he wasn't, was he? he was watching another kind of flying thing. the car backfires and the hiker turns to look. which was his big mistake. by the time the driver looks up, the hiker is already dead. what he doesn't see is what killed him, because it's already being washed downstream. an accomplished sportsman recently returned from foreign travel with a boomerang. you got that from one look? definitely the new sexy. i... i... hush now it's okay. i'm only returning your coat. john? john! - you okay? - how did i get here? well, i don't suppose you remember much, you weren't making a lot of sense. i should warn you, i think lestrade filmed you on his phone. - where is she? - where's who? - the woman, that woman. - what woman? the woman! the woman woman! irene adler? she got away, no one saw her. she wasn't here, sherlock. what are you... what? no, no, no. no. back to bed. you'll be fine in the morning. just sleep. of course i'll be fine, i am fine. i'm absolutely fine. yes, you're great. now, i'll be next door if you need me. - why would i need you? - no reason at all. the photographs are perfectly safe. in the hands of a fugitive sex worker? she's not interested in blackmail. she wants... protection, for some reason. i take it you've stood down the police investigation into the shooting at her house? how can we do anything while she has the photographs? our hands are tied. she'd applaud your choice of words. you see how this works, that camera-phone is her get-out-of-jail-free card. you have to leave her alone. treat her like royalty, mycroft. though not the way she treats royalty. what was that? text. but what was that noise? did you know there were other people after her, too, mycroft, before you sent john and i in there? cia trained killers, i think excellent guess. yeah, thanks for that, mycroft. it's a disgrace, sending your little brother into danger like that. family is all we have in the end, mycroft holmes! shut up, mrs hudson! - mycroft! - hey! - apologies. - thank you. though do, in fact, shut up. it's a bit rude, that noise, isn't it? there's nothing you can do and nothing she will do, as far as i can see. i can put maximum surveillance on her. why bother? you can follow her on twitter. i believe her username is thewhiphand. yes, most amusing. excuse me. hello? why does your phone make that noise? what noise? that noise, the one it just made. it's a text alert, it means i've got a text. your texts don't usually make that noise. well, somebody got hold of the phone and apparently as a joke, personalised their text alert noise. so every time they text you... - it would seem so. - could you turn that phone down a bit? at my time of life it's... see, i'm wondering who could have got hold of your phone, because it would have been in your coat, wouldn't it? i'll leave you to your deductions. i'm not stupid, you know. where do you get that idea? bond air is go, that's decided. check with the coventry lot. talk later. what else does she have? irene adler. the americans wouldn't be interested in her for a couple of compromising photographs. there's more. much more. something big's coming, isn't it? irene adler is no longer any concern of yours. from now on, you will stay out of this. will i? yes, sherlock. you will. now, if you'll excuse me, i have a long and arduous apology to make to a very old friend. do give her my love. - lovely, sherlock. that was lovely. - marvellous. - that was very good. - i wish you could have worn the antlers. some things are best left to the imagination, mrs hudson. - mrs h. - no thank you, sarah. er, no, no, no, no, no, he's not good with names. no, no, no, i can get this. no, sarah was the doctor and then there was the one with the spots and then the one with the nose and then... who was after the boring teacher? nobody. jeanette! process of elimination. dear lord. hello, everyone. sorry, hello. it said on the door just to, - just come up. - hello, molly. everybody saying hello to each other, how wonderful! let me, er... holy mary! wow! so we're having a christmas drinkies, then? - no stopping them, apparently. - it's the one day of the year where the boys have to be nice to me, so it's almost worth it. john? the counter on your blog... - molly, want a drink? - it still says 1,895. no, christmas is cancelled. and you've got a photograph of me wearing that hat! - people like the hat. - no, they don't. what people? - how's the hip? - it's atrocious, but thanks for asking. i've seen much worse, but then i do post-mortems. god, sorry. - don't make jokes, molly. - no, sorry. - here you are. - thank you. i wasn't expecting to see you. i thought you were going to be in dorset for christmas? that's first thing in the morning, me and the wife, we're back together, it's all sorted. no, she's sleeping with a pe teacher. and john, i hear you're off to your sister's, is that right? - yeah. - sherlock was complaining. saying. first time ever, she's cleaned-up her act, she's off the booze. - nope. - shut up, sherlock! i see you've got a new boyfriend, molly, and you're serious about him. what? sorry, what? in fact, you're seeing him this very night and giving him a gift - take a day off. - shut up and have a drink. come on, surely you've all seen the present at the top of the bag. perfectly wrapped with a bow. all the others are slapdash at best. it's for someone special, then. the shade of red echoes her lipstick, either an unconscious association or one that she's deliberately trying to encourage. either way, miss hooper has love on her mind. the fact that she's serious about him is clear from the fact she's giving him a gift at all. that always suggests long-term hopes, however forlorn, and that she's seeing him tonight is evident from her make-up and what she's wearing. obviously trying to compensate for the size of her mouth and breasts... you always say such horrible things. every time. always. always. i am sorry. forgive me. merry christmas, molly hooper. - no! that wasn't... i didn't... - no, it was me. - my god, really? - what? - my phone. - fifty-seven? - sorry, what? - fifty-seven of those texts, the ones i've heard. thrilling that you've been counting. excuse me. - what's up, sherlock? - i said excuse me. do you ever reply? dear lord, we're not going to have christmas phone calls now, are we? have they passed a new law? i think you're going to find irene adler tonight. we already know where she is. as you were kind enough to point out, it hardly matters. no, i mean you're going to find her dead. - you okay? - yes. the only who fitted the description had her brought here, your home from home. you didn't need to come in, molly. it's okay, everyone else was busy with... christmas. the face is a bit sort of bashed-up, so it might be a bit difficult. - that's her, isn't it? - show me the rest of her. that's her. - thank you, miss hooper. - who is she? how did sherlock recognise her from not her face? just the one why? merry christmas. smoking indoors, isn't there one of those... one of those law things? we're in a morgue. there's only so much damage you can do. how did you know she was dead? she had an item in her possession, one she said her life depended on. she chose to give it up. where is this item now? look at them, they all care so much. do you ever wonder if there's something wrong with us? all lives end, all hearts are broken. caring is not an advantage, sherlock. this is low tar. well, you barely knew her. merry christmas, mycroft. and a happy new year. he's on his way. have you found anything? no. did he take the cigarette? - yes. - shit! - he's coming, ten minutes. - there's nothing in the bedroom. well, it looks like he's clean. we've tried all the usual places. are you sure tonight's a danger night? no, but then i never am. you have to stay with him, john. - i've got plans. - no. mycroft... i am really sorry. you know my friends are so wrong about you. you're a great boyfriend. okay, that's good. i mean, i always thought i was great... and sherlock holmes is a very lucky man. jeanette, please. no, i mean it. it's heartwarming. you'll do anything for him. and he can't even tell your girlfriends apart! no, i'll do anything for you, just tell me what it is i'm not doing, tell me! don't make me compete with sherlock holmes! i'll walk your dog for you. there, i've said it now, i'll even walk your dog. i don't have a dog! no, because that was the last one. okay. - jesus! - i'll call you. - no! - ""okay"" that really wasn't very good, was it? hi. you okay? i hope you didn't mess up my sock index this time. lovely tune, sherlock. haven't heard that one before. - you composing? - helps me to think. what are you thinking about? the count on your blog is still stuck at 1,895. yes. faulty, can't seem to fix it. faulty or you've been hacked and it's a message. just faulty. right. right. well, i'm going out for a bit. listen, has he ever had any kind of girlfriend, boyfriend, a relationship, ever? i don't know. how can we not know? he's sherlock. how will we ever know what goes on in that funny old head? right. see you. - john? - yeah? hello. hello. so, any plans for new year tonight? um, nothing fixed. nothing i couldn't heartlessly abandon, yeah. any ideas? one. you know, mycroft could just phone me, if he didn't have this bloody stupid power complex. couldn't we just go to a café? sherlock doesn't follow me everywhere. through there. he's on his way. you were right, he thinks it's mycroft. he's writing sad music. doesn't eat, barely talks, only to correct the television. i'd say he was heartbroken but, well, he's sherlock. he does all that anyway... hello, dr watson. tell him you're alive. he'd come after me. i'll come after you if you don't. i believe you. you were dead on a slab. it was definitely you. dna tests are only as good as the records you keep. and i bet you know the record-keeper. i know what he likes. and i needed to disappear. then how come i can see you and i don't even want to? look, i made a mistake. i sent something to sherlock for safekeeping and i now i need it back, so i need your help. no. - it's for his own safety. - so is this. tell him you're alive. i can't. fine, i'll tell him and i still won't help you. - what do i say? - what do you normally say? you've texted him a lot! - just the usual stuff. - there is no usual in this case. ""good morning. i like your funny hat."" ""i'm sad tonight, let's have dinner."" ""you look sexy on crimewatch, let's have dinner."" 'i'm not hungry ""let's have dinner."" you flirted with sherlock holmes? at him. he never replies. no, sherlock always replies, to everything. he's mr punchline. he will outlive god trying to have the last word - does that make me special? - i don't know, maybe. are you jealous? - we're not a couple. - yes, you are. there. ""i'm not dead. let's have dinner."" who the hell knows about sherlock holmes, but for the record, if anyone out there still cares, - i'm not actually gay. - well, i am. look at us both. i don't think so, do you? stop it! sherlock! sherlock. sherlock. don't snivel, mrs hudson, it'll do nothing to impede the flight of a bullet. what a tender world that would be. please, sorry, sherlock i believe you have something that we want, mr holmes. then why don't you ask for it? i've been asking this one, she doesn't seem to know anything. but you know what i'm asking for, don't you, mr holmes? i believe i do. please help. - first get rid of your boys. - why? i dislike being outnumbered, it makes for too much stupid in the room. you two, go to the car. then get into the car and drive away. don't try to trick me, you know who i am, it doesn't work. next, you can stop pointing that gun at me. so you can point a gun at me? - i'm unarmed. - mind if i check? i insist. don't do anything... moron! - thank you. - you're all right now, you're all right. yes. yes. what's going on? jesus, what the hell is happening? mrs hudson has been attacked by an american, i'm restoring balance to the universe. mrs hudson, my god, are you all right? jesus, what have they done to you? i'm just being so silly. downstairs, take her downstairs and look after her. it's all right. it's all right now, i'll have a look at that. i'm fine, i'm fine. are you going to tell me what's going on? i expect so, now go. lestrade? we've had a break-in at baker street. send your least irritating officers and an ambulance. no, no, no, no, we're fine. no, it's the, it's the burglar, he's got himself rather badly injured. a few broken ribs, fractured skull, suspected punctured lung. he fell out of a window. it stings. that was right on my bins. and exactly how many times did he fall out of the window? it's all a bit of a blur, detective inspector. i lost count. she'll have to sleep upstairs in our flat tonight, - we need to look after her. - no. - she's fine. - no, she's not, look at her. she's got to take some time away from baker street. she can go and stay with her sister. doctor's orders. - don't be absurd. - she's in shock, for god's sake, and all over some bloody stupid camera-phone. - where is it, anyway? - safest place i know. you left it in the pocket of your second-best dressing gown, you clot! i managed to sneak it out when they thought i was having a cw. thank you. - shame on you, john watson. - shame on me? mrs hudson leave baker street? england would fall. - where is it now? - where no one will look. whatever's on that phone is more than just pictures. yes, it is. so, she's alive, then. how are we feeling about that? happy new year, john. do you think you'll be seeing her again? - is that a phone? - it's a camera-phone. - and you're x-raying it? - yes, i am. - whose phone is it? - a woman's. - your girlfriend? - you think she's my girlfriend because i'm x-raying her possessions? - well, we all do silly things! - yes. they do, don't they? very silly. she sent this to my address. and she loves to play games. she does? hey, sherlock... - we have a client. - what, in your bedroom? so, who's after you? - people who want to kill me. - who's that? killers. it would help if you were a tiny bit more specific. so you faked your own death in order to get ahead of them? it worked for a while. except you let john know that you're alive and therefore me. - i knew you'd keep my secret. - you couldn't. but you did, didn't you? where's my camera-phone? it's not here. we're not stupid. then what have you done with it? if they've guessed you've got it, they'll be watching you. if they've been watching me, they'll know that i took a safety deposit box at a bank on the strand a few months ago. i need it. well, we can't just go and get it, can we? molly hooper. she could collect it and take it to barts. then one of your homeless network could bring it here, leave it in the café and one of the boys downstairs could bring it up the back. very good, john, excellent plan, full of intelligent precautions. thank you. so, why don't i phone... so, what do you keep on here? in general, i mean? pictures, information, anything i might find useful. - for blackmail? - for protection. i make my way in the world, i misbehave. i like to know people will be on my side exactly when i need them to be. - so how do you acquire this information? - i told you, i misbehave. but you've acquired something that's more danger than protection. - do you know what it is? - yes. - but i don't understand it. - i assumed. show me. the passcode. - it's not working. - no, because it's a duplicate that i had made into which you've just entered the numbers 1058. i assumed you'd choose something more specific than that, but thanks anyway. i told you that camera-phone was my life. i know when it's in my hand. - you're rather good. - you're not so bad. hamish. john hamish watson, just if you were looking for baby names. there was a man, an mod official and i knew what he liked. one of the things he liked was showing off. he told me this email was going to save the world. he didn't know it, but i photographed it. he was a bit tied up at the time. it's a bit small on that screen, can you read it? - yes. - code, obviously. i had one of the best cryptographers in the country take a look at it, though he was mostly upside-down, as i recall. couldn't figure it out. what can you do, mr holmes? go on, impress a girl. there's a margin for error, but i'm pretty sure there's a 747 leaving heathrow tomorrow at 6:30 in the evening for baltimore. apparently it's going to save the world, i'm not sure how that could be true, but give me a moment, i've only been on the case for eight seconds. come on, it's not code, these are seat allocations on a passenger jet. look! there's no letter i because it can be mistaken for a one no letters past k, the width of the plane is the limit. the numbers always appear randomly and not in sequence, but the letters have little runs of sequence all over the place. families and couples sitting together. only a jumbo is wide enough to need a letter k or rows past 55, which is why there's always an upstairs. there's a row 13, which eliminates the more superstitious airlines. then there's the style of the flight number, 007, that eliminates a few more. and assuming the british point of origin, which would be logical, considering the original source of the information and assuming from the increased pressure on you lately that the crisis is imminent, the only flight that matches all the criteria and departs within the week is the 6:30 to baltimore tomorrow evening from heathrow airport. please don't feel obliged to tell me that was remarkable or amazing. john's expressed that thought in every possible variant available to the english language. i would have you right here, on this desk, until you begged for mercy twice. john, please can you check those flight schedules, see if i'm right? yeah, i'm on it, yeah. - i've never begged for mercy in my life. - twice. yeah, you're right, flight 007. - what did you say? - you're right. no, no, after that, what did you say after that? 007. flight om. 007, 007, 007, 007. something. something 007, 007. what? 007, 007. 007. 007 what? what, something, what? bond air is go. bond air is go. bond air is go. bond air is go. band air is go, that's decided. check with the coventry lat. - coventry. - i've never been. is it nice? where's john? he went out, a couple of hours ago. - i was just talking to him. - he said you do that. what's coventry got to do with anything? it's a story. probably not true. in the second world war, the allies knew that coventry was going to get bombed because they'd broken the german code but they didn't want the germans to know that they'd broken the code so they let it happen anyway. have you ever had anyone? i'm sorry? and when i say had, i'm being indelicate. - i don't understand. - i'll be delicate, then. - let's have dinner. - why? - you might be hungry - i'm not. good. why would i want to have dinner if i wasn't hungry? mr holmes, if it was the end of the world, if this was the very last night, would you have dinner with me? sherlock? too late. that's not the end of the world, that's mrs hudson. sherlock, this man was at the door, is the bell still not working? he shot it. have you come to take me away again? - yes, mr holmes. - well, i decline. i don't think you do. there's going to be a bomb on a passenger jet. the british and american governments know about it, but rather than expose the source of their information, they're going to let it happen. the plane will blow up. coventry all over again the wheel turns, nothing is ever new. well, you're looking all better. how are you feeling? like putting a bullet in your brain, sir. they'd pin a medal on me if i did, sir. the coventry conundrum. what do you think of my solution? the flight of the dead. plane blows up midair, mission accomplished for the terrorists, hundreds of casualties but nobody dies. neat, don't you think? you've been stumbling around the fringes of this one for ages. or were you too bored to notice the pattern? they wouldn't let us see grandad when he was dead. she's not my real aunt. i know human ash. we ran a similar project with the germans a while back, though i believe one of our passengers didn't make the flight. but that's the deceased for you, late, in every sense of the word. how is the plane going to fly? of course, unmanned aircraft, hardly new. it doesn't fly. it will never fly. this entire project is cancelled. the terrorist cells have been informed that we know about the bomb. we can't fool them now. we've lost everything. one fragment of one email and months and years of planning, finished. - your mod man. - that's all it takes. one lonely, naive man, desperate to show off, and a woman clever enough to make him feel special. you should screen your defence people more carefully. i'm not talking about the mod man, sherlock, i'm talking about you! a damsel in distress. in the end, are you really so obvious? because this was textbook. the promise of love, the pain of loss, the joy of redemption. then give him a puzzle and watch him dance. - don't be absurd! - absurd? how quickly did you decipher that email for her? was it the full minute? or were you really eager to impress? i think it was less than five seconds. i drove you into her path. i'm sorry. i didn't know - mr holmes, i think we need to talk. - so do i. there are a number of aspects i'm still not quite clear on. not you, junior, you're done now. there's more, loads more. on this phone i've got secrets and pictures and scandals that could topple your whole world. you have no idea how much havoc i can cause and exactly one way to stop me. unless you want to tell your masters that your biggest security leak is your own little brother. we have people who can get into this. i tested that theory for you. i let sherlock holmes try it for six months. sherlock, dear, tell him what you found when you x-rayed my camera-phone. there are four additional units wired inside the casing. i suspect containing acid or a small amount of explosive. any attempt to open the casing will burn the hard drive. explosive. it's more me. some data is always recoverable. take that risk. you have a passcode to open this. i deeply regret to say we have people who can extract it from you. sherlock? there will be two passcodes, one to open the phone, one to burn the drive. even under duress, you can't know which one she's given you and there would be no point in a second attempt. he's good, isn't he? i should have him on a leash. in fact, i might. we destroy this, then. no one has the information. fine. good idea. unless there are lives of british citizens depending on the information you're about to burn. are there? telling you would be playing fair. i'm not playing any more. a list of my requests and some ideas about my protection once they're granted. i'd say it wouldn't blow much of a hole in the wealth of a nation, but then i'd be lying. i imagine you'd like to sleep on it? - thank you, yes. - too bad. off you pop and talk to people. you've been very thorough i wish our lot were half as good as you. i can't take all the credit, i had a bit of help. jim moriarty sends his love. yes, he's been in touch seems desperate for my attention, which i'm sure can be arranged. i had all this stuff, never knew what to do with it. thank god for the consultant criminal. gave me a lot of advice about how to play the holmes boys. do you know what he calls you? the ice man and the virgin. didn't even ask for anything, i think he just likes to cause trouble. now, that's my kind of man. and here you are, the dominatrix who brought a nation to its knees. - nicely played. - no. sorry? i said no. very, very close, but no. you got carried away. the game was too elaborate, you were enjoying yourself too much. there's no such thing as too much. enjoying the thrill of the chase is fine. craving the distraction of the game, i sympathise entirely, but sentiment? sentiment is a chemical defect found in the losing side. sentiment? what are you talking about? - you. - dear god. look at the poor man. you don't actually think i was interested in you? why? because you're the great sherlock holmes, the clever detective in the funny hat? no. because i took your pulse. elevated. your pupils dilated. i imagine john watson thinks love is a mystery to me but the chemistry is incredibly simple and very destructive. when we first met, you told me that disguise is always a self-portrait. how true of you. the combination to your safe, your measurements, but this, this is far more intimate. this is your heart and you should never let it rule your head. you could have chosen any random number and walked out of here today with everything you've worked for. but you just couldn't resist it, could you? i've always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage. thank you for the final proof. everything i said, it's not real - i was just playing the game. - i know. and this is just losing. there you are, brother. i hope the contents make up for any inconvenience - i may have caused you tonight. - i'm certain they will. if you're feeling kind, lock her up, otherwise let her go. i doubt she'll survive long without her ""protection"". - are you expecting me to beg? - yes. please. you're right. i won't even last six months. i'm sorry about dinner. you don't smoke. i also don't frequent cafés. it's the file on irene adler? closed forever. i am about to go and inform my brother, or, if you prefer, you are, that she somehow got herself into a witness protection scheme in america. new name, new identity. she will survive and thrive, - but he will never see her again. - why would he care? he despised her at the end. won't even mention her by name, just the woman. is that loathing or a salute? one of a kind, the one woman who matters? he's not like that. he doesn't feel things that way. i don't think. my brother has the brain of a scientist or a philosopher, yet he elects to be a detective. what might we deduce about his heart? - i don't know. - neither do i. but initially he wanted to be a pirate. he'll be okay with this, witness protection, never seeing her again, he'll be fine. i agree. that's why i decided to tell him that. instead of what? she's dead. she was captured by a terrorist cell in karachi two months ago and beheaded. it was definitely her? she's done this before. i was thorough this time. it would take sherlock holmes to fool me and i don't think he was on hand, do you? so... what shall we tell sherlock? clearly you've got news. if it's about the leeds triple murder, it was the gardener. did nobody notice the earring? hi. no, it's um... it's about irene adler. well? has something happened? has she come back? no, no, she's... i just bumped into mycroft downstairs, he had to take a call. - is she back in london? - no. she's... - she's in america. - america? got herself on a witness protection scheme, apparently. i don't know how she swung it but... - well, you know. - i know what? well, you won't be able to see her again. why would i want to see her again? - didn't say you did. - is that her file? yes, i was just going to take it back to mycroft. - do you want to... - no. listen, actually... no, but i will have the camera-phone, though. there's nothing on it any more. it's been stripped. i know, but i... i'll still have it. i've got to give this back to mycroft, you can't keep it. sherlock, i have to give this to mycroft, it's the government's now. - i couldn't... - please. thank you. - well, i'd better take this back. - yes. did she ever text you again after all that? once, a few months ago. what did she say? ""goodbye, mr holmes."" when i say run, run. the woman. the woman."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"since you are accustomed to hearing my brother alfred, at this time, i shall allow him to make his usual announcement, you may carry on alfred. thank you kind sir, i agreed to take part in this observed charade, only because i was assured it would get us a booking on a certain, sunday night variety show, however i’m not sure it's worth it, since watching us is rather a limited form of amusement, we have provided you with some alternate entertainment, here it is. ten o'clock tiger well arthur what do you know? i know i can't afford to be seen with a known crook, boxing commissioner is very sensitive in this state. -we could talk in the dressing room. -talk about what? how you could turn 50 into a couple of grand just for the price of a phone call, we only got a few minutes left to post time at valencia park. -get lost. -the horse's name is sweet sloop, if you don't know a bookmaker in this town, you can call new york for a dollar 20 cents, like i said the horse's name is sweet sloop. all right wake up you blubbery slob. too late to call your bookmaker now, -hey the soldier, how is he these days? -oh... he's alive and breathing, but you can say the same thing for an acre of beets. you're so kind about it arthur, when's he gonna fight again? he fights buster bigelow tuesday night in the local arena. how do you think you make up? he'll make out like general custer, you want to kiss the dead? anyway is a friend of yours. no not personally, he doesn't know me, but gosh i must have seen him fight old 10 or 12 times in the old days, boy he was a great one when he had it. sure so they're all, they were all great when they had it. in the first race at valencia park off and running at 1:16 eastern standard time, the winner by seven and a half length sweet salute... target bright was second and molest me not was third. why didn't you say the race was rigged? it wasn't rick arthur, just the winner, he got special attention. you mean the horse got a treatment? yeah yeah that's a nice word for the treatment. ah, now maybe you could have gotten away with it 20 years ago, but not today, not the way they go over those horses before and after every race. in the first race of valencia park the official time for the six furlong sprint, was one minute and 10 seconds flat a new track record, sweet salute paid 88 and 40 cents to win, 52 to place and 28 to show, target bright paid... how about that? -a new track record. -a pig like that, in 20 minutes they'll be giving a saliva test, to everybody in the state including the governor. i won't make any difference arthur, nothing's going to show up in the laboratory test, this was my masterpiece. -you gave the horse the treatment? -oh no no, the formula is mine, but you know yourself, there's not a racetrack in the country, that'll even let me look through the fence, i gave 100 units of the stuff, that, that's enough for one treatment to a groom i know, today was like our test flight. well what about this groom? what about him? i gave my last hundred bucks and a clean syringe, i had to know how this stuff would work under actual racing condition. you trusted the guy? well arthur sometimes it can't be avoided, and anyhow the way i had it figured i couldn't possibly get caught. -come on, come on. -and now listen arthur, this formula is absolutely harmless when administered to any form of mammal, it works for 90 minutes, it doesn't show in the bloodstream or the nervous system, arthur what i’m trying to tell you, is even if they do hold an investigation at valencia park, why it'd be like frisk and a mausoleum picnic for booze, we could do business together. -could we, why? -because you're as hungry as i am, and a contact man that knows the answers, is an absolute necessity to me. horses ain't my specialty, and besides i don't like jail, the only livestock, i know anything about. -no arthur, no. -why not he's a mammal amy. yeah but that don't make him a horse. just try picking up his feet bill sometime. -now you wait a minute... -now just a minute, did you or didn't you say this stuff was harmless? -well as far as i know. -all right then, think ahead, think ahead to next tuesday night at 10 o'clock, could this fat sheep turn into a roaring tiger, say he's half the fighter he used to be, knockbuster bigelow, boom, right into the mezzanine seats, oh could we pick up a beautiful dollar, got stuff with you? i could have, why? something you said a minute ago about a test flight, why couldn't we have a test flight right here in the gym? i don't know. he's going to work out with a sparring partner in about 10 or 15 minutes. -i’d have to think about it. -why? because you hate money? oh come on arthur, layoff, it's a matter of dignity let's say, the invasion of privacy is what i mean, and the fact that he ain't a horse. what's with all this high-class intellectual talk, who are you supposed to be? atlas stevenson? give me a pencil. -how much he weigh? -uh 220. the way i got it figured out, 100 units, is just right for a horse and top racing condition, the average colt weighs about 1100 pounds, -you say you weighs 220? -oh give or take a chocolate pecan sundae. comes out to about a fifth of the quantity, i’d say 20 units, any more would be taking a chance. look, how you give him 20? injection, in the arm just like vitamins. oh that's great, get it ready, he don't nees a needle, no we give vitamins to these meatballs all the time, all right soldier wake up, come on wake up, wake up, he sleeps like a bear, a season at a time. -funny i must have dozed off, huh. -very funny, you know he can sleep in a hammock full of cats, soldier this is doc murphy from terre haute, who just happened to be passing by. oh nice to see you doc. -hello soldier. -the doc's a fan of yours. oh that's nice, i appreciate you dropping by doc. you know the doc's got some new vitamins they ain't even on the market yet. oh that's real nice, a professional man taking an interest, reminds me of a time in cleveland i’m fighting as a child. never mind about ezzard charles. -i couldn't have lost to a nicer fella. -oh well you shut up? -what i was going to say doc... -will you just, don't talk us to death, the doc ain't got all day, you can't buy these vitamins in the five and dime you know, okay doc... you give the doc your arm. never felt the doc, i never felt a thing. save it for the workout. sure, hold it. save it for the work sure. it's just that i feel kinda good. now listen soldier, yesterday this orangutan slapped you around like a pound of salami, but today it's gonna be different, today you're in charge, now get in there and take him apart, all right, let's go to work, it's time. sorry tipsy boy, you know what i mean, i don't know what got into me. -yeah? -it's me. -they're all gone. -anybody see you come up? nobody that would recognize me, -where's the soldier? -he's asleep. what else...as he always. do you suppose he suspects anything? how could he suspect anything when he, ain't got brains enough to have a headache. how much we make in cold cash, arthur? it's all right there in black and white. 3 500 and the tv, 2 800 plus some loose change from the gate, i bet it all except the loose change at five to one, so who needs horses? from now on it's you and me all the way bootsy. once he fight again. he fights luther felix in chicago two weeks into night. same tv producer, only double the money, plus 30 of the gate, how about that? two weeks, he's gonna need more time than that, if he's gonna fight anybody as tough as felix. time for what? for what? well for his cuts to heal, i don't care how sensational he was in there against bigelow, you know he got sliced up pretty good. so what? he patches easy like grandma's quilt. oh come on arthur you can't do that to the soldier. why not? since when did that meatball ever look like robert taylor? all right you guys beat it, -i want to talk to the soldier alone. -this is a romance arthur? yeah, get out of here. all right soldier, it's time to go to work, -it's time for our vitamins. -sure arthur, sure. -all right. -i don't see doc murphy around no more arthur, he sure was a nice fella. i’ll remember to tell him that. you're a great fighter, yes you are, all right let's go, all right, jab, jab, hook, that up boy, that's it oh you're a great fighter you're the greatest fighter that ever lived, you're a tiger, you got seven sets of teeth. ah well bootsy, back on the big time, new york city, layout like this it's the only place, i feel at home, you know what i mean, you know, you wouldn't have to sneak in and out, of here like a dishonest milkman if you trusted me, what kind of a partner are you? that has to look at the books at four o'clock in the morning? this kind, it's the only time i can check up on you. that's very funny, now about the fight... -what about? -well is this about it, he's not going to be in there with just some humpty dumpty this time, he's going to be in there with the champion of the world. -yeah i know arthur i’m listening. -well the point i’m trying to make is, the soldier's a national sensation, now we got to protect the goose that lays the golden egg. i notice how you've been protecting him every time he climbs out of the ring, he looks like he just fought a freight train with his face. it took him seven rounds to take care of sonny fialco, nine rounds for that irishman in san francisco, i got an idea maybe he's building up a tolerance for the stuff. -what about it? -there's this about it, instead of giving him 20 units this time, suppose we make it 30. -now wait a minute arthur you know... -the championship's worth a million dollars, a million for you and a million for me. -i don't like it. -you don't like what? well i don't like getting this last bit of mileage, out of an old retread like the soldier, sure he wins all right, but have you noticed lately that every time he climbs out of the ring, his skull is lopsided and he's got that same glassy look in his eyes? -oh tell me more. -well, i say give the soldier a break, let him get knocked out on the level quick and merciful, and well then the poor clown can retire. will you say that again? look arthur, i’ve been a crook all my life same as you, it's kind of embarrassing to get noble all of a sudden. why don't you go take a nice warm bath. arthur, i’m trying to tell you we never had it so good, the soldier doesn't owe us a thing, look, there was buster bigelow, luther felix, the irishman in san francisco, sonny fialco, the soldier came through for us like a four horsepower like, and do you know why? because he had 20 units of that stuff pumping around inside of him each time, suppose he does win this fight, just think of the punches he's going to have to take with that open door style his, think of a nice poor slob like the soldier walking, around on his heels for the rest of his life. -oh... -or going blind. -oh... you're breaking me up, now if you don't want to have a nice warm bath try some booze, we've got only the best. let's let the soldier off the hook, let him get knocked out quick and merciful and then turn him out to pasture, even if he ain't a horse. oh and another thing, -after this there won't be any more. -won't be any more what? the formula, it was never mind. you're lying. no no i’ve spooked a lot of horses in my time arthur but, as a chemist, you turned me loose in a drugstore and i could, just about mix a chocolate ice cream soda, i got this from freddy piltz king of the spooks, kind of a genius, poor guy died in leavenworth last year, no arthur, i’m leveling this time. after this they're they're in anymore, you're on your own. oh and uh arthur another thing, don't give him more than 20 units at a time. -is everything all right soldier? -fine, charlie just fine. he's got the nervous system of an oyster. you got 20 minutes soldier. all right, come on you guys beat it, all right come on look alive, take off your robe it's time to warm up. sure arthur, sure. ah it's time for your vitamins. -they're 20 000 people out there tonight, you know that? -i know. and you're fighting the champion of the world, now get that through your head. -he's a real nice fella. -who cares if he's a real nice fella. -you want me to warm up now? -no no wait a minute, you know, this is for the championship of the world, few more vitamins, can't do any harm, all right soldier come on give me your arm, now stand still, you take care of that bum tonight you'll be the champion of the world, that a boy, oh jab oh jab, cat boy, cat boy, jab. jab, had it, that's it, that's a boy, that's it if you flatten this thumb tonight, you'll be the champion of the world, all right come on jab, jab, jab, oh that's it knock it off, i said knock it off soldier, what's the matter with you? knock it off, soldier, cut it off will you? knock it off, knock it off, soldier please. he's dead. that is the end of the story i think, needless to say soldier was later apprehended, i don't know how you feel, but for me the story is merely a feeble overture, to the greater music provided by our sponsor, after which alfred and i shall return. alfred has been strangely silent, alfred what are you up to? nothing, until next week, good night."
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"you unlock this door with the key of imagination. beyond it is another dimension- a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. you're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. you've just crossed over into the twilight zone. you know who they are? no, i don't know. strange type for this neighborhood. and you stay away from them, young lady. is that it, boys? yeah, man, that's it. ain't you got any furniture, any chairs or rugs or anything? man, i said that's it. okay, mac, okay. we got work to do. three strangers arrive in a small town. three men in black leather jackets in an empty rented house. we'll call them steve and scott and fred, but their names are not important. their missionis... as three men on motorcycles lead us into the twilight zone. what's wrong with the tv? it's not just the tv. all the lights in the house are flickering. did you leave something on in the kitchen? dishwasher, anything like that? no, dishes are all stacked. tv's still off. it might be the aerial wire, stu, it slipped loose or something once before. i doubt if that would affect all the lights in the house but it's easy enough to check. it seems all right. martha, come here a moment. look. that wasn't there this morning, was it? no. the andersons took their antenna with them when they moved. just our luck. what? ham radio operators. you know what they do to radio and television reception. daddy? yeah, ellen? i don't know what's the matter, but i was listening to my radio while i was studying and all of a sudden, it began picking up these weird voices. ham radio operators. is there anything we can do about it? we can make sure they've got a license to operate. well, do you think you should, stu? those men seem so, kind of threatening, somehow. hello? anybody home? good evening. i'm stu tillman. live over next door. been having a little trouble over there with my electricity- it fades on and off. now you boys don't happen to be ham radio operators, do you? what's so funny? big daddy want to know what's so funny. who are you boys any way? we are monsters, daddy-o. we came from outer space. take us to your leader. now just a minute... cool it, daddy-o, or i'll disintegrate you with my ray gun. now you... look at this cat dance. no, wait, wait. wait, wait, wait. wait. wait a minute! wait a minute! i'm going to get the police on you fellas. and i'm going to call my lawyer. you're going to be sorry that you did this... forget it. stu? stu, what is it? what's happened to you? stu, those men, what have they done to you? nothing. they didn't do anything. well, you were... you were going to ask them about the television interference. oh, it wasn't them, they're nice boys. they're three very nice boys. oh, hey, wait for me. darn you. trouble? did you see that bus? it pulled right away. it's like a game with them. they like to make people suffer. why do they do that? beats me. thank your lucky stars you don't have to depend on buses to get around. stars are lucky? you know that old expression. i understand about the constellations- the nature of the galactic structure, but... i mean, i dig stars, but they're lucky? that's a gas. yeah, so are you. one minute you sound like a professor and the next minute, you're talking like a beatnik. you need a ride? you're not going by the library, are you? i could. with me on the backseat? why not? you ready? yes. i told her to stay away from those boys. she missed her bus and he offered a ride. i'm sure that's all it is. i would have driven her. but you're not a handsome, young man on a motorcycle, dear. i don't see any library. well, it's on the other side of park, but you got me here so quickly, i thought i'd walk. would you like to walk? sure. pretty, isn't it? mm-hmm. you know, this is kind of a special place with me. i come here some times and i just try to figure things out. like what? well, for one thing, did you know that you have lived next door to me for a week and you've never said hello? hello. my name is ellen. my name is scott. where are you from? i mean, where did you live before you moved next door? long way from here. where? oh, i doubt you ever even heard of it. could be- geography is one of my worst subjects. have you finished school? yes. ten years ago. ten years ag... oh, you're not that old. i'm older than you'd think. my people just don't show their age. well, my family's the same way. you know, my grandmother lived to be 90 and you would've taken her for 60 until the day she died. what's the matter? i've never seen anything so beautiful. thank you. well, i guess i'd better be going before the library closes. it's not as late as i thought it was. tell me more about yourself. he'll be here, he got delayed. i'm not interested in excuses. be at ease. where is your brother? we no longer trust our brother. what has he done? formed an attachment here with one of the people. what kind of attachment? i'm not sure yet. he's with a young girl, in spite of our orders. proceed without him. we've been in touch with all units. the second wave has landed successfully and is concealed as planned. with the landing of the third wave we will be in key positions throughout the country. excellent. the people- are they suspicious? not a bit. they're a stupid race, as our research told us. an inferior breed given to killing, hatred, making war, greed and cruelty to one another. the universe can well do without them. you will receive your instructions for the final move in a few days. once again, your brother has failed to report. he has ignored our orders. he has spent the past five days in the company of the girl. we have seen it. now there is no other choice. proceed without him. his fate is his own making. where are you from, scott? does it really matter? no, i don't suppose so. it's just that you're so different from anybody else i've ever known. is that bad? no, not really. you like me, don't you? well, you know that, scott. very much? yes, very much. do you know the word... ""love""? well, of course, silly. what an odd question. what's odd about it? don't you read your newspapers, your magazines? listen to your television programs? your radio? we have. we? scott, who is we? well, that doesn't matter. your planet is filled with hate, ellen. hate, violence, mistrust. i don't see how anyone as nice as you has survived this long. i'm certainly no different from anybody else. i haven't seen a single report on anyone like you. report? scott, you talk in riddles. sometimes you make me feel like an insect under a microscope. please, i'd like to go home. i'm very sorry but i feel as though you have been lying to me. i don't know why or what it is you're trying to hide, but i know you're not what you seem. what if i'm not? do you think you're in any position to judge me? any of you? please, i would like to go home. i'm sorry, ellen. it's my fault. i expected too much. i've done no harm. i'm telling you the truth. what have you been doing the last few days? yesterday when i sent you to the ship for food? last night, when you were supposed to be on guard? you think i don't know? i've been watching you every minute. i told them before we came you were too young. loose your head, you'd run into situations you couldn't handle. i told you, i've done no harm. didn't tell her a thing? no. you're not getting a chance to. we're too close to finishing this mission. from here to the end, you're just along for the ride. report. bacteria unit 59, reporting in. the test has been an unqualified success. good. units 70 through 100 have reported the same results. what is your time estimate? 30 minutes to the reservoir. approximately 24 hours for the bacteria to contaminate the water. how soon before you see results? within 30 hours, we shall witness 50% fatalities. i'd estimate a total of approximately 48 hours before complete extermination. have you coordinated with other units in your area? we have. there are 29 bacteria units covering water supplies in this state. we should easily reach complete population saturation within two days. very well. begin operation invasion phase two at once. scott! it doesn't matter anymore. scott... come down, i've got to see you. it's so late. it's important. all right. scott? you're making a mistake, scott. these people aren't worth it. scott? ellen, you've got to get away from here. what do you mean? get away, you're in danger. i don't understand. something terrible will happen, many people will die. i'll take you someplace where you'll be safe. you're frightening me. what's going to happen? i can't tell you that. it wouldn't matter if i did. we have to leave right now. are you frightening me into running away with you? listen to me! in 24 hours, every man, woman, child, cat, dog, everything alive is going to be dead. oh, scott, don't, please. not just in this town. all over your country, all over your world. my world? scott, it's your world, too. no, it isn't. what do you... scott, who are you? we came from out there, ellen, from beyond those stars. there are thousands of us on this planet now. we need space, we've come to set up colonies. scott, you can't be serious. we have had bacteria units in every country on this planet for months. each unit has enough germs to poison the drinking supply of the entire world population. i will walk with you to your friends' house. you had better let them call you a doctor. no, you've got to listen to me. scott, please, i love you, but you're not well. ellen! all right, ellen, what's this all about? oh, daddy, i don't know what to do. begin by telling me what you were scott said he had to see me... i think he's lost his mind, he's never he was almost raving. what did he say? crazy things. he's a space man, they're taking over the earth and we're all going to die. we better get him some help. deputy sheriff harper. no, sheriff holly's on vacation. this is his deputy. well, this is stuart tillman. i live at 11575 amanda drive. there's a young man next door to me i think might be a little mentally disturbed. i feel he ought to be picked up before he can do harm to himself or somebody else. what makes you think he's mentally disturbed? he's been scaring my daughter with man from mars stories. he claims he's part of an invasion force that's going to take over the world or some such silly thing. all right, mr. tillman, i know exactly what to do. thank you for calling. yes? please listen to me. you may speak. what we're doing is wrong. we should save these creatures, not exterminate them. it's true they murder and hurt one another and they're subject to unreasonable hate and prejudice. but these are only the brutes, and you find them in any race. most of these people have the capacity for love. i know it. our research disproves that. they are a world of angry, frightened people. no, i tell you, they learn love from their god and teach it to their children. there's more of love here than hate. there's no need to kill them. it is too late. not if you order them to stop. for you... a defector? a traitor to your own people? no, i'm not. a traitor. mr. tillman? yes. deputy sheriff harper. oh, won't you come in? martha, ellen! this is my daughter, ellen, and mrs. tillman. how do you do? hello. go ahead, tell him, ellen. i don't know... your father said the boy was mentally disturbed. how did you decide that? well... ellen! ellen! ellen, there's no more time. come in, son. tell us all about it. don't listen to him. he's one of us, he's with the advance units. advance units? what kind of advance units, son? they told me you were ill, son so i took the necessary precautions. no... no! don't fight them, son. it'll only make it more difficult for all of us. don't worry, folks. we'll take good care of him. someday i'm sure he'll thank you. portrait of an american family on the eve of invasion from outer space. we know it's merely fiction. and yet, think twice when you drink your next glass of water. find out if it's from your local reservoir or possibly it came direct to you... from the twilight zone. and now, mr. serling. next time out onthe twilight zone, richard matheson provides us with a tour de force in suspense and the unexpected with a show called ""night call."" it stars one of the most immanent actresses of our time, miss gladys cooper, and it poses the kind of question that arises when a telephone keeps ringing and you realize that the caller has not been on earth for a number of years. i hope this intrigues because i think the show will. next time out, ""night call."""
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[eerie music playing] ancient belief tells us that birds carry our souls, our beliefs, our hopes up to the gods. they are the dark messengers, crisscrossing the twilight sky, forming ever-changing patterns called ""murmurations."" but that word... that word also suggests a voice, a whisper, a prayer uttered in the dark when we think we have lost it all. our story today is ""the murmuring,"" and our director is jennifer kent. [eerie music ends] [unsettling orchestral music] [unsettling music ends] [woman] to those unfamiliar with the dunlin, it would appear to be an unremarkable bird. [projector clicks] but to those familiar with its breathtaking flight patterns, known as murmurations, this species is a miracle of nature. [projector clicks] and a never-ending source of mystery. in this case, a peregrine falcon appears hoping for a meal. you can see it on the edge of frame. and in an instant, the dunlins veer away from it in perfect unison, forming at first an hourglass shape. and then a sphere. and then something akin to a cloud. and finally, most incredibly, a bird in flight. [audience murmurs] not one dunlin is caught, and the poor falcon goes home hungry. [audience chuckles] but the dunlins don't need a predator to prompt this phenomenon. they do it with or without a falcon looming. so, how and why do very few species partake in this exceptional display, forming perfect patterns of movement in the hundreds, thousands, sometimes even millions without any collision or confusion? scientists and ornithologists have been trying to find out why for decades. even lately grasping at such mysterious concepts as natural telepathy. [audience murmurs, chuckles] we are not entirely convinced there's anything as mystical as bird mind-reading going on. [audience laughs] but we are entirely devoted to finding out answers. we would like to acknowledge mr. and mrs. montague, our benefactors, who are here tonight. [man] hear, hear. thank you so much for your generosity. and in particular, for our new movie camera. it's a luxury we've never been able to afford, and it'll make such a difference to our research. and as a thank-you, we have a snippet of footage edgar shot recently of starlings, a practice run. [audience whispers] [projector whirs] [audience murmurs] [audience gasps] [gasping, murmuring continues] [audience laugh, chatter indistinctly] thank you. it's nancy you should be congratulating. she's the mastermind. - where did you film something like that? - [edgar] upstate new york. - [man] have you used a camera before? - [edgar] no, not that one. they're one of the few survivors of the prehistoric era. - much smaller, of course. [chuckles] - [woman laughs] but mostly unchanged, which i find fascinating. i'm also a terrific lover of research. pop me in a room with a stack of books, and i'm happy. what about you, mrs. bradley? what do you love most about birds? oh. their freedom. who wouldn't want to lift off and fly away from the world like that sometimes? [chuckles] i was very happy to hear about your field trip. i'm thrilled it's finally here. we've been planning it for months. very good news for both of you. after all you've been through. [jazzy classical music plays in background] [indistinct chattering] i'm so sorry, edgar. i meant to call you months ago, but... if there is a god, he certainly is a very cruel one. [airplane engine approaches] [propeller whirs loudly] [indistinct chattering] [man] you've picked a time for it, cold and blustery. a perfect time for the dunlins. [man] they're everywhere on the island now. you'll have no shortage. the house is near the bay, and they're all around it. there's a house there? the missus has prepared some rooms for your stay. it's been a while since anyone's used it. it's not the ritz, but it's livable. you didn't have to do that. we couldn't have you staying in tents in this weather, for goodness' sakes. - we're used to it. - [man] i got the generator up and running. so you'll have electricity, running water, a roof over your head. that's very kind of you. tell me, that thing that they do, all flocking together like that, why on earth do they do that? - [boat engine chugging] - [seagulls calling] [edgar] i was expecting a shack. it's enormous! who on earth would've found the need to build such a large home here? with nothing around. oh, the previous owners gave it to the state. more money than sense. did someone live here permanently? the owner built it for his daughter, i believe. shall i take you in? our apologies. it's such a big house, couldn't clear it all. it's a luxury for us. truly. [man] fresh wood in the fireplace is down here. same in the bedrooms upstairs. and the kitchen stove is a wood burner. plenty of wood outside. i'll show you where. and i'll show you where the generator is on the way out. [footsteps fading] i'll be back next sunday to drop off more supplies. [edgar] thanks again. happy birdwatching. [birds chirping loudly] [video camera whirs] [nancy] testing. testing. october 5th, 1951, first day on big harbour island. [birds chirping loudly, wings fluttering] [waves lap shore] [bird calling] [whistling through radio] [whistling] there's a huge flock gathering on the sandbar and i just spotted a peregrine up high. on my way.

[waves lapping shore] [wings fluttering] [video camera whirring] [birds cawing] [howling in distance] [fire crackles] - [nancy] so thoughtful. - hmm? new towels, new sheets. they didn't have to do that. they would've been paid a pittance by cornell. just very good people. i'm really glad we're here. i'm very tired. it's our first full day tomorrow. of course. i just haven't slept. it's no problem.

[both breathe shakily] - what happened? - i have no idea. i'll check, you go back to bed. you go. [edgar] i made you sandwiches. - [nancy] thank you. - [kiss] - [edgar] eat them. - i will. [sighs] [dunlins chirping] [wings flapping loudly] [shutter clicks] [dunlins twittering] [waves lapping shore] - [wings flapping loudly] - [dunlins screech] [whistling] [edgar whistling over radio] did you eat my sandwich? yes, it was delicious. see you soon. do you mind if i don't come over this evening? i need to set up my cataloging system. - oh. - [nancy] you can station the mic i left. - it's got a wide range, i prepped it. - no problem. i can get dinner started. [edgar whistling over radio] [dunlins chirping on tape] [playback stops] [tape rewinds] [dunlins chirping on tape] [footsteps thud in distance] [playback stops] [footsteps in distance] hello? [edgar] hello. [relieved sigh] in here. what are you doing here in the gloom? you'll ruin your eyes. [lamp cord clicks] they're already ruined. you missed a stunning one tonight. possibly the most beautiful of all. you always say that when i'm not there. [edgar] i do not. do i? mm-hmm. - i got good audio, i think. - [nancy] thank you. - they were very noisy. - [chuckles] wonderful. i made a casserole. you're a wonder. i'll get the fire going. [wind howls outside] brontë sisters, madame bovary, crime and punishment. - tess of the d'urbervilles... - that's a cheery selection. what are you reading? the mating habits of the dunlin in the canadian wet tundra region. [chuckling] it sounds provocative. oh, it is. we're not even dealing with them in the mating season, darling. every aspect of their behavior could be a clue. how they mate, how they nest, how they forage. why don't they engage in murmurations during the breeding season, for example? too busy making love. [chuckles softly] [dance band orchestral music playing] [giggles] [giggling] ♪ do the dunlin ♪ [nancy laughs] come on. - no. - please. no. i want to read. [edgar] come, come, come. please. edgar, don't. i'm not in the mood. [edgar] you're never in the mood.

[edgar groans softly] what in god's name are they doing? are they sick? sheltering from the cold? they're built for the cold. i never heard of a dunlin roosting above shrub level, certainly not in an attic. [shutter clicks] my dear little dunlins, what are you doing? [dunlins twittering] [video camera whirring] [wings fluttering] [whirring stops] [video camera whirring] [dunlins singing, wings fluttering] [whistling in distance] [sighs] [whistling in distance] [whispers] i'm recording. [whistling in distance] edgar? [dunlins twittering on tape] [tape player whirs gently] [burst of static] [playback stops] [winding tape back] [dunlins twittering on tape] [burst of static] [high-pitched ringing] [high-pitched warbling] [buttons clunking] [winding tape back] [tape whirs] [high-pitched ringing] [murmuring on tape] [ghostly child's voice] i'm so cold. [tape whirs softly] well? they sound different, more melancholy. did you not hear it? hear what? give them to me. [dunlins chirping through headphones] [buttons clunk] [buttons clunk] [dunlins twittering, wings fluttering] - what did you hear? - shh! [dunlins twittering, wings fluttering] [button clunks] you haven't had any sleep. you're very tired. i listened to it several times. - i don't understand what's happened. - you haven't used an old tape? since when have i ever reused tapes? i'm not a fool. all right, don't bite my head off. it might help if you tell me what i'm meant to be listening for. [wind blows creepily] [dunlins screech in attic] oh, well... it was good while it lasted. [sighs] [dunlins chirping] - [wings fluttering] - [waves lapping shore] [video camera whirring] [edgar] ""they roll like a drunken fingerprint across the sky."" [nancy] mm. richard wilbur. he's talking about murmurations. beautiful poem. what? ""they roll like a drunken fingerprint across the sky."" what do? murmurations. oh. that's good. i cannot find one instance of dunlins roosting in a human structure anywhere. don't you think that's weird? it'll most likely give us years of grief trying to figure it out. it's like they're drawn to this house. drawn? to this house? that's a leap. well, why are they roosting in this house and nowhere else on earth? that we know of yet. [nancy sighs softly] this house gives me the creeps. old houses do that. they're creepy. can i read you some more? what was this family doing here? - the one on the walls. - [edgar] i don't know, my love. why would they leave all their furniture and possessions, gathering dust? for decades? you get that crease, just there, when you're trying to solve a mystery. [sighs wearily, clicks tongue] - i shouldn't frown. - [edgar] no, i like it. it's sexy. - [nancy scoffs] - [edgar laughs] you are sexy. [chuckling] don't be silly. i love you, crazy bird lady. do you love me? [nancy] i have a headache. edgar. don't touch me. - why not? - what's the point? the point is i love you. i'm so sorry. - i just need... - more time. i know. i didn't mean to upset you. i'll leave you be. edgar. [wind howls] [nancy plumps pillow, sighs] [sighs] [sighs wearily] [soft moaning in distance] [ghostly voice] i'm so cold. - [nancy yells] who's there? - what's wrong? i had a bad dream. i'm sorry. it's so stuffy in here with the fire. can i open this, just a crack? [edgar] yes. do you mind if i sleep near the window? that's fine. [edgar grunts] [dunlins twittering] [wings fluttering] [dunlins chirping, wings fluttering] [waves lapping shore] [footsteps rustle grass] [wind howls eerily] [door creaks loudly] [cupboard doors rattle] [soft instrumental music] it's beautiful. [nancy] don't you think it's strange, though? how? what's the one word i always mention when anyone asks me why i'm drawn to birds? you laugh about it. - you always go on about their freedom. - yes, that's right. freedom. it's a feeling a lot of people get when they look at a murmuration, nance. i feel for her. what do you mean? i don't know. i... i just do. living in this big house all on her own. she had her husband and son here by the looks of it. she wasn't alone. it's an accurate embroidery. she must have been a keen birdwatcher. what have i done now? - i don't understand what you want from me. - i don't want anything. [sighs] i don't know. forget it. - did you get much work done today? - there is more to life than work. i know there is, but we're here to work. i thought you wanted me to take a break once in a while. i do. [nancy] this is beautiful. but when i look at it, all i feel is sad. her arm outstretched like that. she must have felt very trapped here. [scoffs softly] i know how she felt. [baby coos in distance] [baby babbles] [baby babbles] [baby grizzles gently] [nancy] oh. ava. [ava babbles] [nancy whispers] hey. [eerie suspenseful music playing] [gasps] [wind howls outside] [gasps, sighs] [running footsteps in corridor] [child crying in distance] [nancy gasps] [breathes shakily] [clattering in distance] [stomping footsteps] [baby crying] [crying intensifies] [crying stops] [nancy breathes shakily] [nancy exhales sharply] [sighs] [nancy] he wrote that he'd leave his wife once he came back from the war, but then when the war was over, he went straight back to his wife, saying, ""oh no, i cannot be with you, my love. i'm heartbroken."" ""i have to honor my marriage."" blah blah blah. - [edgar] mm-hmm. - she must have told him she was pregnant. he mentions a child and paying for it. i could tell from his first letter he was a cad. - [camera shutter clicks] - i suspect she had no idea. - she was head over heels in love... - shh! you're too loud! [wings flapping] he never lived here, he was never part of the family, though the photos make it look like that. why are you so interested in their story? why? 'cause i want to know how they ended up on this island all alone. it's sad. we're staying in their house. [shutter clicks] you feel that gives you permission to read all their personal letters? is it so wrong to read a dead person's letters? yes, it is. and how do you know they're dead? i have a feeling. [edgar] you have a scientist's brain. since when have you relied on ""i have a feeling"" in place of facts? oh, yes, edgar. god forbid i should feel something. the minute some people step into a falling-down old house, they start seeing ghosts. [shutter clicks] some people? i am not ""some people."" and i don't believe in ghosts. you're more interested in people you've never met than your own work. - i have devoted my life to this work. - i know. [nancy] i have worked harder than any of those men who sail through the halls of cornell thinking they're god's gift. i know. i'm sorry. [wings flapping] forgive me for being interested in something other than birds for five minutes! [dunlins twittering] edgar. [nancy over radio] edgar. [video camera whirs, stops] yes? the dunlins are back. [edgar] oh. i'll be over in a while. [wings fluttering] things just got interesting. i'll be there as soon as i can. [dunlins twittering, wings fluttering] [static crackles] [buzzing] [ghostly child's voice] mommy's mad at me. - [woman shouts] what did you do? - [nancy gasps] [breathes shakily] [child whimpers, sobs] [child cries] [nancy breathes shakily] - [child sobs] - [liquid dripping] [sobbing continues] [wind howls outside] [unsettling music playing] [sobbing continues] [boy sobs] [throaty gasping] - [nancy gasps] - [ominous orchestration] [music stops] [nancy breathes shakily] [nancy exhales sharply] [door opens] - where have you been? - working. - you said you'd come as soon as you could. - i was doing my job. [wings fluttering, chirping] open the door. [dunlin chirping loudly] [nancy gasps] [gasps] don't grip it so tight. it's stunned, you'll kill it. - nancy. - please, edgar, put it down. sweetheart, its neck is broken. - oh. - [edgar] poor little thing. oh well, not all is lost. the museum always needs more skins. are you all right? yes. yes, of course.

[screaming loudly] [nancy screams] - [nancy gasps] - [footsteps approaching] - [edgar] nancy. - [breathes shakily] [edgar] nance! it's all right. it's all right, sweetheart. shh. [nancy] the door opened on its own. and then something... [whispers] ...something... it's an old house. everything moves and creaks. let it out, nance. you haven't cried at all. not since... everything happened. it would do you good to let it out. just yesterday, you told me you didn't want me to feel. - that's not what i said. - you said i was being unscientific. relying on my feelings. no, i said i was surprised you were relying on your feelings. because that would be so terrible, wouldn't it? no, nance. i don't know what i... so, which wife do you want me to be, edgar? the one who feels or the one who doesn't? i'm sorry, nance. i'm not perfect. i'm trying. oh yes, you're trying. i don't wanna talk anymore. i just wanna sleep. [dunlins twittering] - [video camera whirring] - [soft eerie music] [video camera whirring] [whirring stops] [man] hello. hello. - got everything you asked for. - wonderful. [boat engine stops] mr. grieves? can you tell me who lived in this house? uh, nobody's lived here for decades. yes, i know that. but... who are the people on the walls? i know this might sound silly, but i have seen some things... here. that's all. some... very odd things. what do you mean? [inaudible chatter] [nancy] why did she live all the way out here alone with her son? her family put her here. it was too isolated. and it didn't work out. how did it not work out? the boy died. how? please, mr. grieves, how did he die? he drowned. she drowned him, didn't she? and where is the mother now? please, mr. grieves. she did away with herself. [inaudible chatter] this happened 30 years ago, mrs. bradley. what is there to tell? i would've liked to have known. my wife and i went out of our way to give you a place to stay, out of this dreadful cold. we really made an effort. of course, and we're enormously grateful. people say they see things here, but it's just a morbid fascination with other people's misery. - people see what they wanna see. - of course. it's all a load of rubbish. i don't believe in ghosts. [door closes] - what was that about? - what was what about? your long, heated conversation with the caretaker? nothing. it wasn't nothing. how am i ever supposed to help you if you never tell me anything? whenever i tell you anything, it's never what you wanna hear. i want to know. i do. i asked him about the people who lived here. the mother and child. all right. because i have been seeing and hearing them ever since we got here. what do you mean? i have seen and heard them. in this house. their voices, their... forms. and i would love it, i would dearly love it, edgar, if i could just tell you this and you would believe me. i know you've had no proper sleep for a whole year. even sane, rational people like you will see and hear things when they've had no sleep. - please, edgar, don't... - i haven't seen anything, nance. no ghosts or goblins. nothing but a big, sad old house. so forgive me. i am trying to understand. don't tell me you're trying to understand like i'm some crazy person. i never said you were crazy! all i know is you've been dealt the worst blow any mother, any human being could've been dealt, and i'm very worried about you. why is it always about me? you went through this too, edgar. why don't you tell me how you feel for once? [shouts] all right! i feel lost. i feel... angry. i feel completely heartbroken. and i... i don't understand you. i... i don't understand how our darling ava can die, and you haven't shed a tear, not one single tear in the whole year since. you want me to cry for you? - would that make it better? - [edgar] no, of course not. i just thought a mother would cry for her child. we took this trip to make things better, and now we're here and you... you seem to care more about these people, these dead people, than you do about your own daughter. you asked me how i feel. well, that's how i feel. you've never let me in, nance. not once through this horrible mess of a year. i try... [breathes emotionally] ...and i try, and i just feel you slipping away. i want more than anything in the world for us to stay together, but i don't... [sighs] i'll sleep down here tonight. head off to my station early in the morning before dawn. unless you want me to stay. just... tell me, nance, and i will. [edgar sighs] i'll be on the radio.

mr. montgomery is sick. ralph. what is it? what's wrong? it's cramps. run down the hall and get doc griffith. no. it's nothing. it's just indigestion. i'll be all right in a minute. you are sure it isn't your heart? no, my heart is fine. it's just cramps. it wouldn't hurt to have the doctor take a look at you. no, i'd feel foolish getting the doctor just for indigestion. i'll be all right. i'm okay now. feeling better, darling? i'm fine. isn't it time you were off to the drama club? i'm not going today. you're not staying home on account of me? yes, i am. i'm going to take care of you. but there's absolutely nothing wrong with me. the way you and george brooks talk, you'd think i was an invalid. george phoned while you were sleeping... and he's very worried about you. nonsense. you know how george exaggerates everything. still, i think i should stay home with you. but what's don welbeck going to do, rehearse with a chair? don't argue with your old man, darling. look, mrs. sutton will take very good care of me. you run along. i'm fit enough to do 18 holes. don't you dare! all right. now, you run along. i'll be all right. i'll just putter around in the workshop. ralph, i'm off. darling, did you buy any weed killer lately... or any spray for the rose bushes? no. do we need some? i'll order it. no. but i just found a package i don't remember buying. in that old cupboard of yours? darling, that's been full of junk for years. you really ought to do something about that. i'll probably find a lot of surprises there. and don't let don welbeck turn your back to the audience. don't worry. i'll take care of don this time. thanks for the lift, don. i'd invite you in for a nightcap, but ralph isn't feeling well. i understand. some other time, then. goodnight, ethel. hello, darling. you're home early. i was worried about you. how are you feeling? good as new. how'd the rehearsal go? all right. ralph, you still look pale. well, dinner didn't sit so well, i guess. you didn't have another attack? no. but i had to eat some of mrs. sutton's lamb curry... to keep peace in the family... and i guess it was a little too spicy for me. but i'm fine. darling, do you mind if i watch the late show? no. don't wait up for me. all right. darling. you know, i've been thinking... mrs. sutton's first month with us is up tomorrow. is it really? it seems much longer. i was wondering if we're completely satisfied with her. i don't see how we could do much better. she's a real find. yes. she is an excellent cook - i thought you liked her. she certainly dotes on you. well, we get along fine. it's just that... i don't know. you're not still pouting about... that silly old newspaper being all wrinkled up, are you? well, it is very annoying. darling, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. i believe you're getting crotchety. okay. do you have to watch this? no. he's got nothing but nerve. read them and weep. dummy makes the drinks. very good. i don't want to hear you squeal, anyway. where was that lead from? desperation, i'd say. wouldn't have the king, would you, george? that's just blind, dumb luck. i'd rather be lucky than good. hey, looks like a lay-down, gentlemen. hearts with the spades, and the diamonds are all good. well, obviously, this is not my week. hey, waiter. waiter, where's that drink? coming up. you made it. you guys get away with murder. superior playing. speaking of murder... i see they haven't caught up with that mrs. andrews yet. ralph has a theory about that. he thinks those poisonings were accidental. sure they were. the woman's a psycho, isn't she, doc? i am a doctor, not a psychiatrist. of course, there weren't any of the usual motives. greed, revenge, fit of passion. what is your opinion, doctor? i only know what i read. but the old giri certainly seems unbalanced. her victims are all women. all young and pretty. but in the last case, the husband was poisoned, too. although it wasn't enough to kill him. what i can't understand is why they haven't found her yet. it was over a month ago. this type runs to a pattern. she probably got herself another housekeeping job somewhere... and she's lying low. but wait until the next full moon... or whatever it is that sets her off. whose deal? i wonder if there are any pictures of her. yeah, there was one in the paper... at the time of the last murder... about, i guess, about the 4th or 5th of last month. are we playing bridge or amateur detective? well, i think i'll call it an evening. oh, ralph. my wife isn't well, as you know. i better go home. ralph, one more rubber. don't pay any attention to the old bachelor. you've got a young, pretty wife... and i don't blame you for wanting to go home to her. he doesn't know how lucky he is. let's settle up next week, shall we? sure. you don't mind if i finish my drink, do you? ralph, give ethel my love, will you? yes, i'll do that. good night, gentlemen. good night, ralph. see you. ethel. yes, dear. are you all right, darling? yes, i'm all right. i just haven't been able to sleep. i'm going to have a cup of cocoa. should i bring some up for you? no, thank you. a cup of cocoa might help that insomnia. i'd like you to run a quick test on this for me, please. i can't say how quick it'll be. what is it? as a matter of fact, it's cocoa. cocoa? yes. there's been some mix-up, and it might contain poison. it would save time if we knew what kind of poison you suspect. arsenic. just a minute. it doesn't show up in the spectrum at any rate. then there's no arsenic in it? well, i wouldn't want to say that for certain. a sublethal dose probably wouldn't show up anyway. let me understand this. you mean there might be arsenic in it, but not enough for a lethal dose? that's a possibility. of course, over a period of time, it's accumulative. i didn't know that. how long would it take you to run a complete test? not more than an hour. but i couldn't get to it until this afternoon. will you do it as quickly as you can, please? here's my card. and will you call me as soon as it's finished? all right, mr. montgomery. thank you. hello, darling. yes. i just wanted to see how you were. oh, well, that's fine. look, darling, why don't you call one of the girls and go out to lunch? yes. well, the change should do you good. that's fine. and look, tell mrs. sutton not to fix anything for you. okay. bye, darling. here's that back issue you asked for. that's the woman who poisoned all those people. yes. i was interested in seeing what she looked like. just morbid curiosity. i had an idea she was a much older woman. i imagine she is. what? that's an old picture of her. why do you say that? mr. montgomery, look at that big hat with all those flowers on it... and the style of the dress. nobody wears anything like that today. how dated would you say it is? fifteen years. perhaps more. add 15 years, 30 pounds. could be. do you recognize her? no, i thought for a moment... that i'd seen her before, but, of course, that's ridiculous. she gives me the jitters. mr. brooks says she poisons young women. hello. mr. montgomery? yes. thank you. that's all for now. and thanks for bringing the papers. you are welcome. hello, yes. yes, this is mr. montgomery. never mind the details. was it poisoned or not? all right. there was not enough arsenic to be fatal. but, as i told you earlier, arsenic is accumulative. i'd say that if you drank that much every day for a week, it would kill you. yes. hello, mrs. sutton. let me talk to my wife right away. i'm afraid you can't. what do you mean i can't? she's not in. no, i don't know where she went. she went out just after you phoned this morning. no, i don't know where she went. i didn't think it was my place to ask. yes, mr. montgomery. tell mr. brooks i've had to leave early. you're not sick again? no. it's my wife. i'm afraid something's happened to her. i hope it's nothing serious. ethel! ethel! yes, dear. are you all right? yes, i'm all right. i will be down in a moment. i was just taking a shower. mrs. sutton, i want you to leave. but i'm just getting dinner. i don't want you to get dinner, tonight or any other time! i'm discharging you. but why? what have i done that's wrong? i think you know that better than anybody else, mrs. sutton. but it ain't fair. you've got to give me notice. you'll get a month's wages in lieu of notice. but i only done what i had to, mr. montgomery. you can't say that i never took good care of you. yes. and you'd have taken care of my wife, too, if i hadn't found out. well, i'm going to give you an opportunity to leave. but i won't guarantee what action i'll take after you leave. your wife. i knew the minute i'd seen her that there'd be trouble. i know that type. you can't trust any of them. i want you out of this house in 20 minutes, mrs. sutton. is that clear? i wouldn't stay here anyways. ethel. yes, dear. ralph, what are you doing home so early? i didn't hear you come in. darling, are you sure you're all right? of course i'm all right. i just decided to take a nap... instead of going out for lunch. what's wrong with mrs. sutton? she stormed past me iike an avenging angel. i just fired her. you fired her? ralph, why? she just hasn't worked out. she's too unreliable. i don't understand. what's she done? for one thing, she lied. she said you were out to lunch, and you were home all the time. she misunderstood. i told her not to bother to make lunch... that i was going out, and then i changed my mind. darling, you're getting awfully jumpy lately. yes, my nerves are a little on edge these days. it's that woman. i can't wait to get her out of the house. it's such a problem getting a good housekeeper. well, she goes. and the sooner, the better. i'm leaving now. i'm sorry. please believe me. my nerves have been on edge lately. if you'll just pay me my wages. yes, of course. but, you see, i would like to apologize... and perhaps, you'd even consider staying on. not where i'm not wanted. but it was all a misunderstanding. i thought you were... i mean... now that i've spoken to my wife... i know that she was upstairs all the time. was she? it's not my place to tell you... what's happening behind your back. what do you mean, mrs. sutton? i mean your wife and that young man that she's in the play with. they made me lie for them, and that's not what i was hired for, mr. montgomery. goodbye. welbeck? ethel. ethel. darling, what's the matter? you're not ill again. no, i'm not ill, but... we got to do something about these nerves of yours. i made you a nice cup of cocoa. it will quiet you down. that was a warm and touching little fable, wasn't it? the kind of story that gets you right here. about my wine-testing. i'm afraid i was very much mistaken about brand z. you will be relieved to hear there was nothing wrong with it. nothing had been added. you see, it wasn't wine. it was mosquito spray. the arsenic belonged there. apparently, the mosquitoes prefer their spray very dry. next week at this same time... i shall invade your living rooms again... provided your television set holds up. good night."

suddenly you've gone too far! professor farnsworth, do you know why we've called you here today? listen to me, you pompous frauds! if i'm going down, i'm taking you all with me! dean vernon, i know the truth! it was you driving your hover car that night, not your horse. dean epsilon... ...i know all about your ""department of pool boy studies"". and dr. wernstrum? wernstrum! actually, professor, we merely called you here to say... ...surprise. - happy birthday! - surprise! and you, coach smalley! or should i say, ""coach hairpiece""? no, professor. it's a surprise party... ...for your 150th birthday! good evening, i'm... sorry. i'm bender, and i'll be emceeing this roast. they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps. so here's the professor's oldest friend, a grotesque, stinking lobster! good evening, ladies and germs. that wasn't a joke. i was talking to dean streptococcus. now i'm not saying professor farnsworth is old... ...but if you consider his age, he's likely to die soon. hey, ringo? that was the joke. it's showtime at the apollo all over again. where would a professor be without students who love and respect him? right there! but seriously, of all the former crew members of his delivery ship... ...our next speaker is by far the most alive. captain musky? i wouldn't want to follow that guy. and now, a man who needs no introduction. fry, get up there! thank you. when i was first asked to make a film about my nephew, the professor... ...i thought, why should i? then later, leela made the film. but if i had made it, there would be more topless women on motorcycles. roll film. hubert j. farnsworth was born april 9th, 2851... ... in new new york's nerdiest slum, hell's laboratory. a precocious child, he learned to read while he was still in diapers... ... at age 8. soon he became a greasy teenager. dork alert! after 14 years of graduate school... ... he settled into the glamorous life of a scientist. fast cars, trendy nightspots... ... beautiful women. the professor designed them all, working out of his one-room apartment. for 50 years, he worked at mom's friendly robot company... ... where he created the first robot capable of qualifying for a boat loan. and now, even as he nears his 150th birthday... ... the professor retains the fiery passion of youth. listen to me, you pompous frauds! if i'm going down, i'm taking you all with me! how about a few words, professor? i said, words. what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishment... ...summed up in a 3-minute film. my best years are behind me. so much left undone. so little time. funny, funny stuff! my life is over. no, it isn't. you have another 10 years left. leela, he could live another 100 years! no, he couldn't. when you turn 160... ...robots from the sunset squad take you to a mysterious planet... ...and you never return. wow, a whole planet of old people. where is it? nobody knows. so many loves half-ioved. so many inventions half-invented. that damn time machine alone set me back 15 years. if only it'd work, you could go back and not waste your time on it. there's no one to carry on after i'm gone. no one to take over my work and my research and my fabulous fortune. by god, that's it! i've got to name a successor! a successor? a successor to the professor? there's no time to lose. i'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming machine! the professor's been in his lab for days! i hope he didn't die. unless he named me his successor. then i hope he did die. you, the successor? over my empty shell! the professor will pick me. only i have his lobster-like tenacity. up yours, zoidberg! up wherever your species traditionally crams things. the only sensible way to pick a successor is with a limbo contest. - what? - kingston rules. two men go down, one comes up. look, the professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. he wouldn't trust you with his dentures. yes, he would. sorry, everyone. but need i remind you, blood is thicker than water. blood. thicker. water. everyone, i have a very dramatic announcement. so anyone with a weak heart should leave now. goodbye. professor? oh, yes! the announcement. as you all know, i am not long for this world. - yes, we know. - one foot in the grave. so i've picked my successor. it's someone in whom i have great faith... ...though his mind is undeveloped and he's accomplished nothing. my closest living relative... ...my clone, qbert farnsworth. he's horrible! crud. can i at least be in charge of your dentures? you wish. where did he come from? 12 years ago, i began the cloning process... ...by removing skin cells from one of the shapelier growths on my back. if he's your clone, why doesn't his nose look like yours? i left him in his first tube too long and he got squished against the side. is he dumb or just ugly? let's find out. what? you've never seen a genius's wiener before? - no. never. - well, once in the park. since i'm going to be in charge... ...let me examine my so-called crew. if it can so be called. first of all, dr. zoidberg... ...do you even have a medical degree? i lost it. in a volcano. and why do we need a bending robot around here anyway? what possible use do we have for you? me no speak-a the english. and why does our space pilot have only one eye? there's someone i'd like you to meet. his name is depth perception. why, you little... wow, that hurt... the air! him pending para un bending. qbert, come in here. i'll show you something amazing. what is it, a competent employee? i doubt that very much. the little twerp. as my successor, i'm trusting you to carry on my work. these are some of the inventions you'll spend your life finishing. i didn't realize you were the inventor of the junk heap. that's my prizewinning smell-a-scope. if a dog craps anywhere in the universe, i won't be out of the loop. and this is my universal translator. unfortunately, so far... ...it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language. - hello. - bonjour. crazy gibberish! - don't you have worthwhile inventions? - why, certainly! step over here. these are the dark-matter engines i invented. they allow my starship to travel between galaxies in mere hours. that's impossible. you can't go faster than the speed of light. of course not. that's why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208. also impossible. and what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner... ...which delivers 200-percent fuel efficiency. that's especially impossible. not at all. it's very simple. then explain it. now that's impossible! it came to me in a dream and i forgot it in another dream. your explanations are pure weapons-grade bologn-ium. it's all impossible! nothing's impossible if you can imagine it. that's what being a scientist is all about. no, that's what being a magical elf is all about. oh, my god! it's elzar, the tv chef! kill me now, people! - how we doing here? - elzar, everything's so good! are you an ass-kissing machine? yes, sir! good one, sir! it's a gem of an evening. i feel so wonderful having someone to take over my life's work. and it's all thanks to qbert. look, i may be identical to you in every possible way... ...but that doesn't mean i'm anything like you. i don't want to be an inventor. i want to be something useful, like a teacher's aide... ...or a prison guard or a science-fiction cartoon writer. but what about my hopes and my dreams... ...and my wonderful inventions? in your life, your only half-decent invention was me. and i didn't turn out like you wanted either. - you folks still doing all right? - oh, yes, elzar. turns out i forgot to cook that chicken. bad news, everyone. by the time you watch this tape, i'll be gone... ... leaving behind only a history of failure and my original hipbones. you see, i've been lying about my age. i'm not actually 150. i'm 160. oh, vanity, thy name is professor farnsworth. and now that i have nothing to live for... ... i've alerted the sunset squad robots to take me away. goodbye, cruel world! goodbye, cruel lamp. goodbye, cruel velvet drapes... ...lined with what appears to be some sort of cruel muslin... ...and the cute little pompon curtain pull cords... ...cruel though they may be... and now that i have nothing to live for... ... i've alerted the sunset squad robots to take me away. i know you're all upset, especially bender. well, life goes on. except for you! i'm sure he's just made a cutting remark... ... but he doesn 't know i taped over his soap operas to record this. you bastard! we've got to get him back! impossible. no one knows where they take them. nothing's impossible! you'd know that if you really took after him, like i do. you're his uncle, dummy. he takes after you! yeah, well, what? wait a second! that means i also take after you! i think i know how to find him. lay it on us, big boots. if this can pick up his odor, we may have a chance to save him. i think not. as you probably don't know... ...odors are made up of particles that can't travel through space. i'm zeroing in on him. bengay. mothballs! letters to the editor! it's the professor! to the flying machine! to the left! no, to the up! u-turn! we'll never find this place. robots are good at keeping secrets. no, we're not, you little bed wetter. sorry. there it is! the near-death star! we'll say the professor escaped and we're bringing him back. fry, dress up like a 160-year-old man. i'm on it. my god... ...the illusion is so perfect i almost forgot i was looking at an idiot! they may ask for a dna sample. i'd like to see them find it. this plan is impossible. we don't even have a sample of his dna. i think i know where to get some. why do i have to be the hump? because you're too ugly to be a wart. your medicare dollars at work. halt! identify this guest. this is professor hubert farnsworth. he escaped. escaped? no one escapes. this guest does not look 160. what? i'm old. listen. hey, you kids! get off the lawn! old people are often concerned that there are children on their lawns. no denying that. but we'll need to verify his identity with a dna sample. got a hot, steaming batch right here. we only needed one cell. keep the change, buddy! stupid robot. - did your hump just say something? - i've got ""talking hump syndrome. "" ah, t.h.s. identity confirmed. return this shambling shuffleboarder to his room. 7152 maple drive. - sounds nice. - prepare to be surprised. so this is where they stick old people! it's horrific! it does keep them from driving. brace yourself for the worst. - and yet he looks so natural. - what's happening? he's hooked up to life support. we have to disconnect him carefully... ...or the shock could kill him. freeze! seize them! get them! i mean, seize them! oh, i'm so bad at this. we'll probably make it, but we might not! - it's impossible! we'll never fit! - will too! told you. come on, leela! step your big boot down on the gas pedal! - they've blown out one of our engines! - fix it! fix it! fix it! fix it! fix it! only the professor knows how. we have to wake him up. try shocking him! your social security check is late! stuff costs more than it used to! young people use curse words! damn, we'll have to fix it ourselves! we can't, you bastard! no one knows how it works! it's impossible! nothing is impossible! i know how the engines work now. it came to me in a dream. the engines don't move the ship at all! the ship stays where it is, and the engines move the universe around it! that's a complete load. nothing's a complete load. not if you can imagine it. that's what being a scientist is about. right, professor? let's ride. good news, everyone! he's completely recovered. - all right! - yeah. i'm as spry as a 140-year-old. see? i only broke one ankle. what happened to you in the drawer? i was hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely real. - what was it like? - i was at a facility in florida... ...with hundreds of other old people. all day we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call. it's more horrible than anything i could imagine. oh, my, yes. thank you all for saving me. especially you, my little clone. no matter what you decide to do with your life, i'm still proud of you. i've already decided. dad, when i grow up i want to be just like you. oh, don't worry, son. you will. incidentally, read up on the condition known as wandering bladder. why? no reason. no reason at all. subtitles by sdi media group [english]"
0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"(""alfred hitchcock"" theme music) - good evening. the prevalence of mashes in our streets and parks has brought about this charming device. it looks like a ladies compact, but it is really much more than that. when milady is accosted by some undesirable party she simply takes this out, as though to powder her nose. however, when she opens it... (air hissing) before you can say ""jack the ripper"" a cloud of tear gas is sprayed in the villain's face. perhaps this lacks some of the excitement that went with wielding the old-fashion hat pin, but it is most effective. furthermore, it actually contained a mirror and powder so that you could freshen up before the police arrive. that's odd, i should be weeping by now. no wonder, it wasn't tear gas after all. this one uses mustard gas. while we wait for developments, you may pass the time by watching tonight's narrative. it is about a young woman named helen clarvoe, who is the object of some mysterious threats. but first we have another device which can bring tears to the eyes of the more fastidious, - yes. yes, of course i know who this is. dorothy, stop bothering me! yes, dorothy. please leave me alone. now what would compel you to say a thing like that? that's not true, you know better than that! yes, of course i received it. it was waiting for me when i got in. yes, i read it. yes. yes. listen, dorothy, don't threaten me, please. hello? (tense music) - you certainly should have called me long before this. - probably, i just didn't think it was very serious until she phoned today and started to threaten me. - what time did she call? - a little after i got in from the office. i couldn't hear anything on the other end of the phone for a while, and then i could hear her breathing. and then she said, ""hello, helen? ""do you know who this is?"" of course i knew who it was. dorothy has been cultivating that accent until it's as sweet as that sugar there. - wanna try one, fast energy? - no, thank you. she said that she read that article about by father dying and my gaining all of the inheritance. if i didn't share it with her something bad was gonna happen to me. i don't know how she got a hold of my private phone number. i'm gonna change it though first thing in the morning. and oh, there's the letter. - dear helen, had a dream about you last night. you were dying-- - paul, i've read it, many times. oh, came in this envelope? - yep! - jack terola, photographer. - well, dorothy used to model when we were in high school. my father always thought she was pretty enough to have been a professional model. i don't know whether she ever did anything about that. she may have though, she was rather unpredictable. - in what way? - her behavior was always unexpected, very erratic, almost psychotic. like that nursery rhyme. you know the one with schizophrenic on the line, ""when she was good, she was very good. ""and when she was bad, she was horrid."" she had an undercurrent of violence. always had fits of rage. the last time i saw her she was in a rage. - when was that? - you remember that she was gonna marry my brother, douglas? - oh, yes, what happened there? - i never really wanted to go into it before, but the date was all set and then a day before the wedding i discovered that she had taken what amounted to a great deal of money from my family. so i told my father and i told douglas. of course she denied it. she said that i lied and she screamed and yelled and she threw things. she picked up a letter opener, i could have sworn she was going to stab me. and then she did this entire reversal in her behavior. she broke down and she cried. it's really very interesting. i told a friend of mine about it at the time, a psychiatrist, she said that she had all of the symptoms of of a real psychosis. - (coughs) excuse me. and you want me to find her? - well, yes. - i think it's a good idea, i think somebody should speak to her. she should be warned. - i don't want to open up a whole thing with the police. i just want you to find her and tell her to leave me alone. i have an old address on her. i don't know whether she'd still be living there or not. - i'll take it and check. i might find a forwarding address or something. oh and while you're at it, put down the number of your private phone, will ya? i wouldn't have it changed if i were you. just don't answer it, and if i want you i'll ring once and hang up and then i'll ring again. first thing tomorrow morning i'll go down to terola's studio. see if i can find if there's some connection between him and dorothy johnson. then i'll check this old address and i'll call you right after. all right? - all right. thank you, goodnight. - goodnight. - how's the wife? - oh, she's as sassy as ever! - and the kids? - they're all three down with the mumps. oh boy, i don't know, i don't think i should be here, it may be contagious. - it's all right, i've had them. send them my love. - good, i will. goodnight. are you gonna be all right? - oh, yes. - don't worry, i'll find her. everything will be taken care of. - thank you, paul. - oh, and keep the chain on the door. - okay, goodnight. - goodnight.

(tense music) (tense music) - helen clarvoe is a liar! i have not been phoning her at the vicente hotel. and i have not been pussy footing it around there! she has always hated me with such a vengeance! doesn't she have anything better to do than to sit around weaving webs and making up lies? have you got a cigarette? my mama don't keep any around. you know what helen's label is? spoiled rich! i wish i did have her money. spoiled rich! - have you ever heard of jack terola? - why, has he ever heard of me? - he said you were in his studio last wednesday. - and? - and have been phoning him ever since. - it's the last one. i'm sorry i can't offer you any, but hair of the dog, know what i mean? bow wow, ruff ruff, mr. blacksheep. - blackshear. - i know. jack terola is a very good photographer and i did phone him several years ago. i wanted him to take my wedding picture, but i never phoned him back 'cause there was nothing to take a picture of thanks to helen. would you like to see something mr. baa baa blacksheep? zip! you know this thing cost my mama almost four months salary? turned her hair gray. some mornings i just put it on for the fun of it. stumble around. helen clarvoe is the reason why this dress never walked down the isle with me in it. she couldn't stand it, that i was gonna be mrs. douglas clarvoe! so she went to work, lady spotter that she is, and she manufactured a lie that killed his love. though i could have been caught with another man, douglas would have forgiven me that. but the fact that i stole money, oh money is so important to those clarvoes! i hate helen clarvoe and i hate her mother and i hate her brother! i liked their father 'cause he was always nice to me. that added fuel to the fire, let me tell you. i'm not feeling very well this morning, mr. blacksheep. i have what is commonly known as a hangover. and all of these questions, these lies with the question marks at the end of them, are making my head hurt awful. i just don't wanna talk about it anymore. - there won't be any trouble, miss johnson, if you'll just leave my client alone. (laughing) oh there won't? - no. - you get outta here, mr. blacksheep, before i lose my temper! and you tell helen clarvoe she better stop telling them lies about me or i'll give her something to lie about! you hear me? get out!

(phone ringing) hello? wait a minute till i put you on the speaker. it's helen. you're late! - [helen] i'm sorry, i feel asleep reading balzac. is paul there yet? - hello! you know, i don't think i've spoken on the phone without speaking on the phone before. - i just got it the other day! - i saw dorothy johnson, helen. i went to that old address you gave me and there was a forwarding address downtown, then another one out to the beach, and then another one back into town, and i eventually found her. she's living with her mother. - [helen] what did she have to say? - she denied everything. she said that you're lying. - to be expected, wasn't it? - i can't be sure that i really got through to her. she was paralyzed with a hangover. she was unpleasant, hysterical, ordered me out of the house. - just put it on the bar, we'll make our own. - [helen] what? - i was talking to margie, dear. if you hurry you'll have time for a drink. - [helen] are you gonna stay for dinner, paul? - [mrs. clarvoe] of course he is. - well i'm gonna have to if you hang me up here much longer. - well, i'll just have to put on my shoes and i'll get a cab. i'll be right over, bye. - [mrs. clarvoe] bye! ding! busted! - what's the matter? - turn your head, paul, i'm about to cheat. go make us a drink. - the usual? - look what i've done! i've won again! three in a row! (phone ringing) - how did you manage to do that? - hello? hello? - [dorothy] mrs. clarvoe? this is dorothy johnson. remember me? - what do you want? - [dorothy] you've been talking to lovely helen, haven't you? i tried to phone you both but your lines were busy. now, helen's not in her room, i just wanted to tell helen, and you can tell her for me. i don't appreciate you sending your lawyer around asking me questions! helen tells terrible lies, mrs. clarvoe! if it don't stop, she's gonna be sorry. now you tell her that, you hear me? - i hear you. - [dorothy] tell her i had another dream about her. tell her-- - what do you want? - well, we could start with money. tell her i want my picture made, say $343. the amount helen said i stole from mr. clarvoe's wallet that just happened to lying on the table in the den. that was a lie, mrs. clarvoe! i hate helen for telling that lie. you tell her, i hate her and that i intend to make her pay for what she did!

(door opening) did ya forget something? (door closing) did you forget part of the order? (footsteps approaching) robin, is that you? who is it? - it's dorothy johnson. - it's who? - dorothy johnson. i have the money now, mr. terola. - now look, miss johnson, i'm not gonna take your picture. will you please just be a good girl and go away before i call the police? (door opening) what's the matter with you, can't you read? get out of here! will ya get out-- (gunshots blasting) (dramatic music) (clattering) (dramatic music) - a few of our viewers wrote in telling us that they feel the station break is the high point of the evening. we shall now hear from one of those viewers. (eerie music) - here you are. - that's all right, i've got it. it only takes 30, 40 minutes, paul, to get here, even in the five o'clock traffic. helen's always late but she's never this late. - well let's give her another 15 minutes. she may have stopped to get you a bouquet of flowers, who knows. - helen's never brought me flowers in her life. - i'll tell you what, i think i better phone molly, tell her i'm gonna be even later and see how the kids are. - use the phone in the hall. (phone ringing) hello? yes, yes. - [dorothy] into the park, she thought she could lose me in the park, in the trees. but helen's forgotten how clever i am at playing hide and seek. there i was, just waiting for her cool as a cucumber on the other side at the end of the path. you should have seen her ugly face when she saw me. - where is helen? - [dorothy] is that you, mr. blackshear? - yes, where is she? - [dorothy] would you care to repeat that question again please? - where is she? - [dorothy] that's the third time you've asked me that question (laughs). you know, she's not as bright as you thinks she is, mrs. clarvoe. - where are you, dorothy? - [dorothy] not as bright as you've always bragged her to be. - she had almost $200 in her purse. now i don't call that smart. but that still wasn't enough to have my picture taken. i gave every penny of it to mr. terola. he wanted to know if i could read. of course i can read. and i can add and subtract and multiply and divide. two times two is four. four times four is 16. 16 times 16-- (phone clicking) - paul! - i'm going to phone terola's studio and see what i can find out. - i'll use the hall phone and try the hotel again. - right.

(tense music) for you to see scenes from our next production. they follow in a few moments. our new compacts have been taken off the market. in the test areas, los angeles, pittsburgh, and london, the gas did not prove to be a deterrent. in fact, the muggers, long accustomed to the atmosphere in these cities regarded the gas as distinct improvement. perhaps next week when i return, i shall have another device. until then, i'm sure that heaven will protect the working girl.

he's not an ordinary hologram. he knows about love, life, women! - things you know nothing about. - that's unfair. then why are you asking advice from a light bulb? why are you so surprised? what did you expect? - i wasn't expecting anything. - i see. how long has it been since shakaar and major kira broke up? - about a year. - it's been over a year. you've had plenty of time to arrange a merger with kira, but have you tried to open negotiations? no. it's not that simple. odo, the woman waited a year for you to make an offer, any kind of offer. you've had plenty of opportunities and let them slip away. - who asked for your opinion? - you did. i came here to talk about groat clusters. you started talking about the major. you want my advice? no. - forget all about her. - is that the best you can do? i'd like to see someone do better. so would i. you're not the most lovable person in the galaxy. you're not even the most lovable person in the sector or on the station. or even in this room. you're cold, rigid, remote. - can i leave now? - please do. - wait. - odo, make up your mind. i need a favour from you. it's about dr bashir's new holosuite program. - you're up late, doctor. - can't sleep. - feeling a bit tense. - i've got just the thing. one warp core breach coming right up. a few sips of this and you'll be relaxed for the next three days. i'm not that tense, quark. i'll just go up to the holosuite. if you could hand me my program. sorry, doctor, all the holosuites are in use. - at this hour? - it's been that kind of a night. there won't be one available for the rest of the evening. that's unfortunate. maybe i'll go and wake up miles, play a little tongo. i remember back in '58 i was playing the sands. frank and dean dropped by. we took over a blackjack table. between the three of us, we must have dropped 15 big ones. - frank goes over to the pit boss... - look, mr fontaine... vic. vic, these stories are all very interesting, but i didn't come here to reminisce about your past. yesterday, when my friends and i were here, you seemed to know things. - i've been around the block. - specific things. dax and worf are married, the chief misses his wife. you don't have to be an einstein to clue into any of that. at one point, you were going to make an observation about major kira and myself. i didn't want to embarrass anyone, give away any secrets. - what secrets are you talking about? - do i have to connect the dots? you're crazy about her, but you're afraid to do anything. - and she... well, you know. - no. go on. - she thinks of you as a friend. - i wouldn't call that a secret. but women do change their minds. you just have to give them a reason. - you make it sound so easy. - because it's not that hard. the girl already likes you. you're halfway home. she's aware of my feelings toward her, but she prefers shakaar. who? the first minister of bajor. he's a leader, a hero. it's not the other guy you have to worry about. it's you. me? for starters, you've got to lose this ""nanook of the north"" thing. i don't understand. you've got as much personality as an icicle. - you're frozen solid. - you think i have no emotions. believe me, i do. i just don't always show them. and therein lies the problem. - come with me. - where to? if you want to win the girl, we've got to thaw you out. turn up the heat, get those emotions bubbling to the surface. it's time to have some fun. what does fun have to do with major kira? i'll pretend i didn't hear that. first, let's lose those threads. there's nothing like a tuxedo to make you feel like a million bucks. you mean something like this? very sharp. after you. - i don't sing. - glad to hear it. what i need is someone to handle the black and whites. my piano player threw ten sevens at the craps table and took off for reno. so have a seat, my friend. - the crowd's getting restless. - what crowd? that one. good evening, ladies and gentlemen. i'm vic fontaine. and tonight is going to be a gas. hit it, nanook. - i don't play the piano. - you want a bet? - stay with me, pally. - the piano's doing all the work. you've got to sell it. style, baby. make them believe. style. come fly with me, come fly, let's fly away. if you can use some exotic booze there's a bar in far bombay. come fly with me, come fly, let's fly away. come fly with me, let's take off to peru. in lama land there's a one-man band. and he'll toot his flute for you. fly with me, let's take off in the blue. once i get you up there. where the air is rarefied. we'll just glide, starry-eyed. once i get you up there i'll be holding you so near. you may hear angels cheer cos we're together. weather-wise it's such a lovely day. you just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to acapulco bay. it's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say. come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away. once i get you up there. where the air is rarefied. we'll just glide, starry-eyed. once i get you up there i'll be holding you so near. you may hear angels cheer cos we're together. weather-wise it's such a lovely day. just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to acapulco bay. it's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say. come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away. come fly with me, pack up, let's fly away. no, it's nothing. cool! - bottoms up. - i don't drink. why am i not surprised? it's not real booze. - how do you like being in the spotlight? - very bright. that's all? the lights kept me from seeing the audience. that's why i wasn't nervous. nothing to be nervous about. you were too busy having fun. i suppose i was. i'm just grateful none of my friends saw me. there you go, tensing up again. you're standing there like a statue. the only things you're going to attract are pigeons. sit down. relax. take a couple of deep breaths and everything you want will come to you. - that's all it takes? - try it. go on. - see? - are you expecting someone? let's find out. - surprise! - what are you ladies doing here? - you invited us. - that's right. come on in. - odo, we've got company. - look, it's the piano player. we saw you perform. melissa thinks you're adorable. would you mind if i looked at your hands? show her your hands. i knew it. they're so artistic. i once played on the same bill with liberace. - he has the sweetest dimples. - are you classically trained? - vic taught me everything i know. - is he a good student? head of his class. maybe i can help you get your diploma. the night is young and i have a table waiting for us at the dunes. - we're going to see shecky. - shecky who? you didn't tell me he had a sense of humour. he plays the piano and he's funny. kind of like victor borge. - who? - i think i'm in love. after you, ladies. uh, i don't... what are you worried about? melissa's a very nice girl. i'm sure she is. it's just she's not kira. - how do you get to carnegie hall? - i have no idea. practice, practice, practice. get it? think of this evening as a trial run. you're going to do great. captain, here's the report on that smuggling ring. - should i forward the information? - i'll let you know in a minute. no, no, they can't take that away from me. the way your smile just beams... - yes, captain? - don't stop on my account. - stop what? - you were singing. i was singing? no, no, they can't take that away from me. you're right. i was singing. they can't take that away from me. we may never, never meet again. on that bumpy, bumpy road to love... lieutenant. - julian. - morning. ops. should you ask kira about shakaar or should i? why don't you? but she's staying on bajor two more days. she and shakaar must be having a good time. - poor odo. - what's he got to do with it? not a thing. that's the problem. have fun. thank you. keep clapping. there's a fly in the room and one of you is bound to nail him. why the long face, buddy boy? you haven't told me what to do about kira and shakaar. forget about that fink. i bet he doesn't look half as good in a tux. what difference does that make? you've been coming here for a week. have i steered you wrong? no. then you trust your uncle vic. we have a special surprise tonight. if she doesn't raise your temperature, check the obituary column. chances are you're in it. let's have a nice, warm round of applause for miss lola crystal. never know how much i love you. never know how much i care. when you put your arms around me i get a feeling that's so hard to bear, you give me fever. remind you of anyone? when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight. fever. in the morning, fever all through the night. everybody's got the fever. that is something you all know. fever isn't such a new thing. fever started long, long ago. sun lights up the daytime. moon lights up the night. i light up when you call my name cos you know i'm gonna treat you right. you give me fever. when you kiss me, fever, if you live, you learn. fever. till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn. what a lovely way to burn. what a lovely way to burn. don't look now, but i think she likes you. a toast. as georgie jessel once said, ""to whatever makes you happy"". my thoughts exactly. i'm going to turn in. you two lovebirds can live without me? we'll manage. you have a beautiful voice. and you... have beautiful hands. so i've been told. - they feel good, too. - so do you. i've been waiting to hold you like this for as long as i can remember. - we just met tonight. - i must have a short memory. - you're funny. - like victor borge? how did you know? i can't do this. - why not? - it has nothing to do with you. vic. what's wrong? - this isn't working. - you were getting along fine. you programmed her to find me irresistible. i could read her a criminal activities report. she'd think it was poetry. - she's nothing like kira. - who's kira? - of course not. she's a hologram. - a what? do you know how difficult it was to get a holographic image of major kira? lucky for you, julian used her image in one of his spy programs. i appreciate what you've done, but it's all been in vain. i may be romeo in the holosuite, but i when i see the real kira i'll turn back into nanook of the north. - you're starting to talk the talk. - i was hoping for more than that. wait! you can't give up now. i'm sorry, but i am tired of discussing my feelings with a hologram. you're a hologram, too? - odo, hello. - major. anything interesting happen while i was gone? no, nothing at all. as a matter of fact, it's been rather dull. - i'm sorry to hear that. - i'd better get back to work. - hey, doll face. you asleep? - how the hell did you get in here? i'm performing next door. i'm between sets, so i transferred my matrix from that holosuite to this one. - what do you want? - we have to talk. - about what? - odo. what else? - we both know he's nuts about you. - he told you that? we've been spending a lot of time together. odo spending time in a holosuite? - and loving it. - that's not the odo that i know. you don't know him as well as you think you do. he's not the same stick-in-the-mud any more. - are we talking about the same odo? - the one and only. but the only chick he wants to swing with is you. i take it that's a good thing. it's love, baby. nothing better than that. - how did you get in here again? - we're talking about you and odo. that's what you were talking about. i'm meditating. - i don't mean to interrupt. - good. then leave. talk about your cranky aliens. you two really are made for each other. which is why you've got to come to the holosuite tonight. - you and odo can have dinner. - why doesn't he ask me himself? i'm asking you for him and neither one of us will take no for an answer. then i'd better say yes. crazy. odo? can you hear me? vic? what are you doing on the com line? i need to talk to you. i want you to come to the holosuite tonight. why? i've done a complete overhaul on the kira hologram. you'll think she's the real thing. she walks like kira, talks like kira. really? how did you manage to accomplish that? i'll see you tonight, 9:00. that's 2100 to you. - i know. - i'll see you then, pally. i believe you two know each other. - you look lovely. - thank you. so do you. mademoiselle. i'll be your server this evening. i'll try not to spill anything. to begin, a little dom perignon '55 and some oysters rockefeller. to be followed by caesar salad, chateaubriand and cherries jubilee. this is all very interesting, but don't you feel a little silly being here in a holosuite? a bit. let me know when you're ready for the salad. bon appetit. it's french, an earth language. it means ""enjoy your meal”. - i didn't know you spoke french. - i don't. it's something i learned from vic. french is the language of love. - vic's a fountain of information. - he's certainly a man of many talents. but we're really not here to talk about vic, are we? i'm certainly not. i always wondered what this would be like. the two of us having dinner together? - it's not the way i pictured it. - it is a bit unusual. you haven't touched your food. it looks delicious. i'm not hungry. - truth is i'm a little nervous. - you? nervous? a bit. it is our first date, right? right. there's nothing wrong with being a little nervous as long as it doesn't get in the way of enjoying yourself. - the only thing you enjoy is your work. - how do you know that? you told me yourself. - well done, vic. - vic? never mind. i do enjoy my work, but i'm afraid i've used it as an excuse to avoid the rest of my life. i know the feeling. i've got you. under my skin. i've got you. deep in the heart of me. so deep in my heart. you're really a part of me. i've got you. under my skin. - it's a pretty song. - it is, isn't it? - you're sure you're not hungry? - sure. what do we do now? only one thing we can do. dance with me. i'm not sure i know how to dance to this kind of music. just stay close. - sorry. - that's good. use your mentality. wake up to reality. and each time i do, just the thought of you. makes me stop before i begin. cos i've got you... i had no idea you could dance. it's amazing what you can learn in a holosuite. i can't believe we're having our first date in a holosuite. cos i've got you. under my skin i know you wouldn't be comfortable at quark's, but i know one or two out-of-the-way restaurants on the station. i don't think that's possible. are you embarrassed to be seen with me? no! i meant it would be difficult for you to leave the holosuite. - why? - it's complicated. complicated to leave a holosuite? you make it sound like i'm a hologram. - aren't you? - is that what you think? - maybe you'd better tell her. - there's nothing to tell. i'm good, but i'm not that good. you've been dancing with the real mccoy. - you tricked me! - and me. i brought you lovebirds together. that was the idea, wasn't it? nerys... kira... major... don't say it. computer, end program. - odo? are you there? - i have nothing to say to you. - i know you think i sold you out. - you lied to me! for your own good. it was time to start playing with the real thing. - you should have said it was kira. - would you have shown up? i don't hear an answer. there's not much to be mad about. i saw the way she looked at you. the lady digs you big time. she ""digs"" shakaar. i can only imagine what she thinks of me. - i insisted she was a hologram. - odo, listen to me. i'm done listening to you! computer, end transmission. - will you tell me what's wrong? - there's nothing wrong. have you ever had a moment of pure clarity where the truth seems to grab you by the throat? i bet this has something to do with shakaar. have you ever had a moment like that? one or two, but that's over a span of seven lifetimes. two moments of clarity in seven lifetimes? - total clarity is a very rare thing. - i guess so. when it comes to you, it's important that you act on it. confusion and doubt will take over before you know it. you're absolutely right. it makes perfect sense. not another moment of clarity? - that's two in two days. - that's amazing. odo, wait. - i'd like to forget about last night. - we need to talk about it. - we can meet in my office. - let's discuss it over dinner. - you can choose the restaurant. - will shakaar approve? i don't care whether he approves. shakaar and i are friends. that's all. the first minister asked me to update him on the war. - are we going to have dinner or not? - if we do, then what? - you'll expect me to kiss you. - it's possible. - why don't i just kiss you right now? - why don't you? you're right. who needs dinner? cos i've got you. under my skin. cos i've got you. under my skin. in vegas, there's only one way not to lose money. the moment you step off the plane, walk into the propellers. see you in a few minutes. - odo. long time no see. - i've been busy. julian tells me you and the major are quite an item. who knows how long it'll last? that's my odo, always ready to turn victory into defeat. - i wanted to thank you for your help. - any time, pally. - feel like sitting in on a number? - some other time. say hi to the major for me. do me a favour. leave the program running for a few minutes. - i feel like singing. - whatever makes you happy. come fly with me, come fly, let's fly away. if you can use some exotic booze. there's a bar in far bombay. it's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say. come fly with me, come fly, let's fly away. come fly with me, pack up, let's fly away"
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"- not more than 50 or 60... - i can see it now. 200 people jammed into our quarters, eating, drinking, laughing. that sounds awful. what if i promise absolutely no laughing? you won't see a single smile the entire evening. it'll be the grimmest party you've ever been to. - when do you want to have this party? - next week. i was thinking maybe the evening should have a theme. what kind of theme? what if everyone came as their favourite klingon? - bad idea. - your holosuite is ready. - good. - have fun exercising. - no party? - i came this close. - thank you. - don't mention it. glad to be of help. bajoran lilacs. is there something going on between you two? don't be disgusting. - i ordered them for myself. - that's nice. - i thought you didn't like flowers. - i don't. - i'm confused. - there's such a thing as privacy. not between friends. my mother would've been 60 today. my father said these were her favourite. that's a nice way to remember her. i wish i did remember her. i was only three when she died. i'd bet she'd be proud of you and what you've done with your life. i'd like to think so. i've always been proud of her. my father always said she was the bravest woman he ever met. major kira, you have an incoming transmission. - from whom? - unable to identify. put it through. ah, major, there you are. i'm sorry to wake you. - what the hell do you want? - don't bother. you won't be able to trace this transmission. then why don't you just tell me where you are? because that's not why i called. i want to help you, major, the way captain sisko helped me. what are you talking about? captain sisko gave me the clarity to see beyond the lies, the self-deceptions that were controlling my life. he helped me to see the truth about myself. and now i'm going to do the same for you. and what better day to do it than on your mother's birthday? is that supposed to upset me, you knowing my mother's birthday? she was a striking woman, your mother, although when we first met she was very self-conscious about that scar along the side of her face. she used to try to cover it up with a strand of hair. nice try, dukat. but you never knew my mother. she died in the... singha refugee centre? i'm afraid not, major. your father told you that because he couldn't face the truth. what truth? that your mother left him to be with me. you're lying. your mother and i were lovers almost from the moment we met and we remained lovers until the day she died. - i have had enough of this. - i see you have lilacs. your mother would've been touched. she loved bajoran lilacs. there. i told you the truth was liberating. don't you feel better? i do. locate cardassian occupation file, singha refugee centre. find and display bajoran identity profile kira meru. the battle of the alamo would make a great holosuite program. let me get this straight. 200 of us are trapped inside some crumbling old mission, surrounded by 2,000 enemy troops. - is that right? - that's right. - do we win? - no, we lose! - then why play it? - you're missing the point. nothing's more noble than a defeat against overwhelming odds. in life maybe but not in the holosuite. chief, you should have finished recalibrating those modulators. we had a problem replacing the coil brackets. i want it done within the hour. doctor, is there a reason for your visit? what? - actually, miles and i were... - thought not. - we're on duty here. - i don't want to interfere. we're not at the replimat. we're not here to drink raktajinos and gossip. let's get to work. there is increased criminal activity on the promenade. it's not as bad as it sounds. we're talking about petty theft. i've already assigned two deputies. i'd prefer that you handle the matter yourself. - if you think it's necessary. - i do. make sure you keep me informed of your progress. of course. - is there something else on your mind? - meaning what? meaning i talked with dr bashir. he told me you seemed irritable. i see he's not exaggerating. would you care to tell me what's bothering you? i appreciate the offer, odo, but talking about it isn't going to help. - sounds serious. - it is. if you won't talk about it, perhaps you should consider doing something about it. a transmission from gul dukat? this is the first i've heard of it. - i didn't report it. - why not? it was of a personal nature. i tried to trace the signal but... what did he want? he said he knew my mother, that they were lovers. you don't believe him, do you? he knew certain personal things about her. dukat is resourceful. i'm sure he knows a lot about all of our families. i keep telling myself that, but i need to know. - that may not be possible. - there is a way. i can visit the temple of iponu and consult the orb of time. - excuse me? - i need to know the truth. let me get this straight. you want to travel back in time to see if gul dukat and your mother were lovers. the federation has very strict regulations... this has nothing to do with the federation. i need your help as the emissary, not as starfleet captain. the emissary can allow me access to the orb. after that, it's up to the prophets. if they feel that my request is worthy, they'll send me where i need to go. if not, i've made a trip to bajor for nothing. and if they do send you back? what then? how do you know you won't interfere with the timeline? the prophets will guide me. nothing will happen without their blessings. please, emissary. please. let me seek the will of the prophets. meru, i found nerys. - where was she? - over there, scrounging for food. - come here, sweetie, beside me. - is that all? that's barely half a cup. - they've cut rations. - how do they expect us to survive? the cardassians don't care if we do. they want us all dead. - sweetie, have some soup. - excuse me. - that soup. it's ours. - my wife stood in line all day for it. - if you think you can just... - just what? it's for the children. they're hungry. - we are all hungry. - right. we are. hunger makes people do stupid things. - like what you're doing now. - we shouldn't be fighting. - we should be helping each other. - helping ourselves to soup. you want soup, you go stand in line. we may have to take orders from the spoonheads but not from you! thank you. i wish we could repay your kindness but we have so little food. it's all right. i'm not hungry. i can't remember the last time i met a bajoran who wasn't hungry. - i'm kira meru. - i'm... just glad i could help. and this is my husband taban, my son, reon, my son, pohl, and my daughter, nerys. they're beautiful. - mummy. - what is it, honey? what is it? tell me. she wants to know what your name is. me? i'm luma rahl. it's nice to meet you, nerys. attention! the new ore processing centre is nearing completion. the cardassian troops stationed there will require ""comfort women"" to make their tour of duty less stressful. her. no! from now on you'll receive extra food and medicine, courtesy of our prefect, gul dukat. - her. - no! and her. but my children! they will eat better than they have any right to. - meru! - mummy! i love you. don't let them forget me! you. and you. ladies, can i have your attention, please? you will find food in your quarters. eat as much as you want. and make sure you get a good night's rest. you'll want to look your best tomorrow. and feel free to linger as long as you want in the sonic showers. cardassians value cleanliness. meru, listen to me. i know things look bad. but don't give up just yet. - we'll find a way to get out of here. - how? there must be a resistance cell operating here. - they'll help us get away. - i don't believe this. fresh moba! do you know how long it's been since i've seen fresh moba? - nice. - nice? look at this. katterpod beans. hasperat. veklava. a pot of deka tea. we could live on this for a year. easy. easy. you don't want to make yourself sick. sick from too much food? that would be a change. if only taban and the children were here. the cardassians said they would take care of them, so maybe they will. don't count on it. we need to find a way to get off this station. once we do, we'll figure out a way to free your family. - then what? - we'll join the resistance. - i suppose that's possible. - of course it is. till then, we'll just need to bide our... i'm sorry. i failed to show a cardassian soldier the proper respect. we all have scars of one kind or another. maybe. but most aren't quite so evident. it's not so bad. why do you keep doing that? - what? - helping me. first at the refugee centre and now here. i don't have many friends. well, you have one now. well done. i can hardly believe you're the same women i met yesterday. in fact, you're not. your old lives have ended. your pasts have been erased. you have one purpose and one purpose only. to provide comfort and care to the cardassian officers stationed here. do that well, and you'll want for nothing. fail and you and your family will be sent to a labour camp. now, remember ladies, you're all easily replaceable. - make one mistake and i... - basso! that's enough. welcome to terok nor. i hope your stay will be pleasant. i assure you, i will do everything possible to make it so. i suspect that many of you must be feeling a bit uneasy right now. i'm well aware that among the bajoran population there is a perception that all cardassians are to be feared, that we are a cruel and heartless people. i hope to change that. not with words, but with actions, in the hope that you will come to appreciate the better part of our nature. i assure you we are capable of great kindness. what of our families? are they all right? who said you could speak?! guards! stay where you are. your families will be well taken care of. that i promise you. what is this? basso. forgive me, prefect. i didn't notice the imperfection. - i'll have her removed. - get me a dermal regenerator. now. i'm afraid to ask how you came by such a mark. - it's nothing. - on the contrary. it's an unfortunate reminder of the gulf that exists between our two peoples. it must be removed immediately. just relax. it's all right. relax. there. beautiful. carry on. i'd say congratulations are in order. you've all passed your first test. mind telling me what you're smiling about? the prophets. i never realised they had such a sense of humour. when i was a child i dreamed of having enough food and pretty clothes, and now look at me. i have everything i ever wanted, and i feel horrible. that is pretty funny in a horrible way. i suppose if i can survive starvation i could survive this. after all, we bajorans can survive anything. you. think you can stand there hiding in a corner all night? - i don't remember seeing you before. - i just arrived yesterday. and you're thinking you'd like to get us all drunk and kill us in our sleep. are you sure you're not part betazoid? come. sit on my lap and tell me how much you hate cardassians. you bajoran women, you're all so bony. that's because you cardassians eat all our food. you know, i could have you executed for that kind of insolence. and that's one of the reasons we hate you so much. clever girl. now pour me some more of that kanar and let's see if we can't work out our differences. let her go. i said let her go. - all i said to her was... - i don't care. i don't like what you were doing. now get away from her. are you all right? basso. escort this woman back to her quarters and see that her privacy is respected. she will not be disturbed. i only hope you won't condemn us all for the boorish behaviour of one man. i only hope you won't condemn us all for the boorish behaviour of one man. how did you know he'd say that? this is not the first performance i've seen of this little melodrama. that woman should consider herself fortunate. she's caught the prefect's eye. as of now, she's off limits to the rest of us. - as for you... - i know. i know. more kanar. now. one foot in front of another. don't tell me what to do. i'll put my feet wherever i want. i'm a cardassian. just don't stumble out of any airlocks on your way home. i'm not going home. i'm coming in with you. no, you're going back to your quarters to sleep. i want comfort and i want it now. you are a comfort woman, aren't you? - you're dressed like one. - don't let appearances fool you. that mouth of yours will get you in trouble. now, let's go get some sleep. i have a better idea. you go sleep in your quarters. i'll sleep in mine, and tomorrow... tomorrow, you'll be all mine to do with as i please. i can hardly wait. meru, i'm back. i'll have to shower for a week to get his smell off me. - i'll tell him you said that. - where's meru? you're going to have these quarters all to yourself. - where's meru? - she's moving up in the world. your friend must have hidden talents. our prefect has invited her to share his quarters. - i want to see her. - do you? i said take me to her! hey! how's work going on the ore processing centre? you ought to find out for yourself. once the centre's up and running we'll all be slaving away down there. - i have news for you. - about my friend? i know why you haven't heard from her. - she hasn't been on the station. - what? word has it she's been off on a little vacation with gul dukat. they just got back today. - she's nothing but a collaborator. - she is not a collaborator. she's a comfort woman for the spoonheads, isn't she? - so was i. - for a day. but i've been watching you. you have no love for the spoonheads. neither does she. look, i don't want to join your resistance cell. - just leave me alone. - i will, i promise. - i need you to draw a map for me. - a map of what? - the cardy side of the station. - i was only there one day. anything you remember will help - quarters, corridors, meeting rooms. - why? what are you planning? - it doesn't concern you. are you going to help us or not? you. follow me. you may enter. luma. are you all right? i've been worried about you. i know. i wanted to get a message to you. - has he hurt you? - who? dukat. hurt me? no. he hasn't hurt me. i wish i knew how to explain to you these past few weeks, make you understand. - understand what? - that i'm not a monster. you see? i told you i'd find a big enough vase. - what do you think? - they're beautiful. i don't think your friend approves of the flowers. or of me. meru... are you sure this is the woman you want as your companion? - yes. - as you wish. the fact is... i've treated meru with nothing but kindness and consideration. if you don't believe me, ask her. i'll be back as soon as this meeting is finished. it's true. he's very different from what i expected. don't let that smile fool you. he's still the enemy. - it's not that simple. - yes. it is. meru. listen to me. while you're in here playing games he's exterminating our people. he's not. he's urging central command to rethink their policy towards bajor. i don't care if he played you a holo-recording of him begging central command to end the occupation. it would still be a lie! like that first night when he saved you from that gul. he set the whole thing up to win you over. he told me. he tells me everything. you just don't know him. i don't need to know him. i know the things he's done. look what he did to you. he took you away from your family. he's going to send them food and medical supplies. that still doesn't make it right. what about your husband? taban loves you. how can you forget him so quickly? i have not forgotten him. what do you expect me to do? kick dukat every time he comes near me? how is that going to help taban or the children? you think you're doing it for the children? the clothes, the food, the easy living are all for them? it's not for them. it's for you. you like it here. you enjoy playing house with that murderer. don't you see what you've allowed yourself to become? you're a collaborator. a collaborator? because i share dukat's bed? no, because you've fallen in love with him! - where are you going? - back where i belong. it's composed of ultritium resin, so it's doubtful that the cardassian sensors will pick it up. - but there's always a chance. - you let me worry about that. - you've done this before? - you'd be surprised. remember, the bomb is set to go off three minutes after it's activated, and once it's activated, it cannot be disarmed. so make sure you have enough time to get away. how large of a blast radius are we talking about? 20 metres. plant it somewhere in dukat's quarters. - i'll pick the right spot for it. - what about his bajoran mistress? - what about her? - you cannot tell her what you're doing. not even to save her life. why would i do that? like you said, she's a collaborator. she deserves whatever she gets. i'm beginning to find you tiresome. i don't like you much either. take me to kira meru. i have better things to do than to shuttle you around this station. decide which side of this gate you want to be on. i have. now take me to kira so that i can apologise to her. guard. a wise decision. - i didn't expect to see you again. - i came because i owe you an apology. the things i said, they were unfair. i'd like us to be friends again. so would i. whatever makes you happy, my dear. - can i get you something? - maybe later. first thing we do is get you some new quarters close by. sounds good. i have the transmission copy you requested. - thank you, basso. that'll be all. - what about her? don't concern yourself with luma. she won't cause us any more trouble, will you? - that's not what i'm here for. - no, it isn't. well, basso, find her some new quarters. right away. this is for you. i think you'll find it very interesting. i'll be in my study if you need me. - i'll see to my quarters. - ok, luma. meru, i hope the cardassians aren't lying to me and that they will send this message to you. we've only been home a few weeks but you should see the children. it's like they've been transformed. reon and pohl are laughing and playing together. they've never been happier. and little nerys must have gained five pounds. of course, they keep asking for you. i've said you're still at the refugee centre. i think that's best, at least for the time being. i can't believe how much i miss you. i think about you all the time. you've saved all our lives. i hope you realise that. never forget it, not even for an instant. every day i pray to the prophets that you'll find some peace in this new life of yours. i believe that even in the worst of times, we can still find moments of joy and kindness. if you can find that kindness, hold on to it. and remember, no matter what happens, i love you, meru. i'll always love you. we've got to get out of here. dukat, get out here, now! go! - what? - there's a bomb. get out of the way! meru! meru. i've always hated collaborators. what could be worse than betraying your own people? during the occupation, if i ever had any doubt about what their fate should be i would think of my mother, how she gave her life for bajor. she was a hero. they were traitors. it was that simple. or so i thought. she did what she had to do to save her family. to save you. it doesn't make it right. maybe not. but it was her decision to make. i did some checking. she died in a cardassian hospital seven years after she met dukat. do you know how many bajorans died during that time? died. while my mother sat sipping kanar with dukat. tell me something, nerys. if you hate her that much, why did you save her life? believe me, there's a part of me that wishes that i hadn't. but the fact is no matter what she did she was still my mother."

now that i think about it, you're right. unfortunately,... i'm not feeling very well. perhaps dr crusher could get you started inputting your information. i must return to my quarters. are you still having those headaches? i'd better bring you a hypospray for it. - i would be most grateful. - ok. put a cold cloth on your forehead. i'll be with you shortly. i'll set you up. you'll take a while to input the figures, won't you? at least an hour. but i do not believe much time can be saved by haste now. data, there are times when every second does count. space, the final frontier. these are the voyages of the starship enterprise. its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. somehow, i had an unnatural fear that data was going to barge in to discuss the peripheral effects of magnetospheric energy taps. if i don't go and look at his projections, he just might come looking for me. do you know, when i first met the formidable dr beverly... what, ten days ago? ..l thought to myself, this woman is ice. through to her bones! who would have ever guessed that instead of ice there is fire? odan,... - stay here. - no! are we...? is this interfering with your work on the peliar zel problems? fortunately, i've done as much as i can until we get there, because i can't seem to keep my mind on my work right now. - i have... to go! - no! - promise we'll be together tonight. - i promise. - then you may go, dr beverly. - it's just beverly. it's not just beverly. it's beverly's smile, it's her kindness, her beauty within and without. so much more than ""just beverly"". picard to ambassador odan. captain, this is odan. the representative from peliar zel is in the observation lounge. i'll be right there, captain. if the news were encouraging, you would not be here. i'm afraid you're correct. the situation is growing worse. - where have you been? - with a patient. minor emergency. ambassador odan. this is governor leka trion of peliar zel. ambassador, thank you for coming. i knew your father. his efforts kept our people at peace for generations. i would hope to serve you as well as he. governor. ambassador. i hope dr crusher was able to help your headache. thank you, she was. governor leka has intercepted us to update us on her planet's situation. the people on our moons have been in discord since they migrated from our planet five centuries ago. to us on the planet, they're two squabbling children. we try to help them by not taking sides, but this time we are at a loss. i've studied the information you sent. i understand the people of alpha moon have found a way to tap into the magnetic field of your planet, and now rely exclusively on that energy source? yes, but the beta moon is now suffering environmentally as a result. my design model suggests... that beta will eventually experience rising temperatures, erratic tide surges, and, in general, the beginning of global warming. the impact on the health of the betans is clear. there will be profound medical repercussions. alpha is unwilling to give up its new-found energy source. beta accuses them of intentionally courting genocide. our efforts to reach a compromise have failed. now we have received intelligence that both sides are arming for war. if that happens, the people on my planet will take sides, and the outcome can only be disastrous. we'll be in orbit in six hours. if you could arrange for the moon representatives to be there. odan can beam directly down to the planet's surface. excuse me, i prefer to shuttle to the surface. i would not recommend it, there are many radical factions involved in this dispute, it would be hard to guarantee your safety. i'm not the first to express discomfort at the idea of molecular transport. i prefer to remain intact. - i'll shuttle down. - as you wish. counsellor, what is it? it's ambassador odan. i continually feel fluctuations of emotion from him. perhaps it's normal among the trill. it could be. we know so very little about them. yes. quite. - hi, deanna. - hi. is that the colgonite astringent you have on your eyes? yes, i guess so. i've never tried it. someone... just put it on... me. - i didn't know you came in here. - i don't. at least... not very often. it feels good to indulge yourself sometimes. i guess so. especially when you haven't in a while. what is... what is that supposed to mean? beverly,... you're in love. sometimes, i wish you weren't so... empathic. i don't think it's really a secret. - it isn't? - you've been glowing. must be the astringent. what? nothing. oh, yes, there is. what is it? it's just something i sense in odan. what? what do you sense? it's just... how well do you know him? i feel i know him better than i've known anyone in my life. am i being foolish? i don't think so. and yet, i've only known him for a couple of weeks. of course, it could be infatuation. but as a grown-up i know the difference between love and infatuation. all i know is,... ..l haven't felt this way for a long time. - and you like it. - i like it. come. - you wanted to see me, captain? - yes. please sit down. we have entered orbit. we shall be transporting you to the planet soon. i am ready, captain. how will you proceed when there? i can never answer that until i'm in the situation and i meet the people involved. i work very much by instinct, not by prearranged plan. it seems to work well for you. i do like to go into a situation as well-informed as possible, and i must say your staff has been quite helpful in briefing me on the problems down there. particularly dr crusher. my staff is quite capable, i'm glad they've been useful. your dr beverly is... ..an extraordinary person,... both as a scientist and... ..and as a woman. yes, i'm sure that's true. shall we make our way to the shuttle bay? captain, you know her better than l. do you have any idea how committed she is to remaining with starfleet? - i couldn't speak for her. - of course not. i just thought... you've known her so much longer than l. - taggart to capt picard. - yes, ensign? the shuttle is ready to transport the ambassador. very well. i'll find my own way, captain. i hope to return with good news. cmdr riker has asked to pilot you himself. i am honoured. - i don't know when i'll be back. - i know. have a safe trip. i will stay safe. i have good reason to return. i've researched earth customs. this flower is given to express love. yes, it is. initiate shuttle preflight sequence. preflight under way. shuttle has cleared the bay door. you will be out of shield range in five seconds. acknowledged. we'll enter the upper ionosphere in two minutes. sir, an unidentified ship is emerging from the limb of the moon. hail the vessel. i have visual contact. i don't recognize it. it claims to be an escort vessel from the beta moon. there was no mention of an escort. request a security clearance code. they do not answer, sir. - cmdr riker, prepare to return. - acknowledged. they are loading their phaser banks. powering the shields! coming about. engage tractor beam. report, number one. we've lost port thrusters and stabilizers. i'm losing control. we're bringing you in. the hull's weak, we're breaking up. you can't tow us. beam us directly on board. - no, don't do it. - i can't stabilize the shuttle. if you transport me, it will kill me. please! we're ready to beam you aboard. belay that. i'll bring her in manually. advise dr crusher we have a medical emergency. he's in shock, but that still doesn't explain these readings. eosinophilia in the cerebrospinal fluid at 46 percent. sedimentation rate is 29, but his lymphocytes are still intact. it's as though there's a parasite at work. odan. i need to do exploratory surgery. you may have a parasitic infection. you must not. you won't survive. what is that? beverly,... that is me. what? this body is just a host. i am that parasite. that... is what must survive. it has always been this way. the trill are a joined species,... ..a host and a symbiont. and in this fashion, we have survived for millennia. you're dying. what can i do? the host... body is dying. you must contact the trill quickly. tell them i need another host. they will send a replacement. i know this is difficult to accept. but i beg you, dr beverly,... ..help me. this mission must be completed. odan's host body died of the injuries just over an hour ago. but the symbiont being, odan, is still alive. odan is the one who negotiated the last treaty, but the man everybody thought was his father was just a host body. the reason odan refused to transport? it would have damaged the symbiont. the trill say another host will be here in 40 hours. i've placed odan in stasis. he can survive another hour, maybe two, but not beyond that. would it be possible for me to serve as a temporary carrier? no, data. the relationship requires a biological being. we're at a desperate impasse here. the shuttle attack has inflamed the dispute. - who was responsible? - no one admits to it. each side accuses the other. we need odan. - could a human host carry him? - i believe so. from odan's description, it should be possible, - but i don't... - i volunteer. there's been no precedent for a human host. i couldn't guarantee what might happen. - the risk is too great. - weigh it against a possible war. it's your choice, will. let's get to it. i've given you a local anaesthetic. you must be conscious. drugs might damage the symbiont. - i understand. - laser scalpel. how do you feel? is there any pain? no, just some strange sensations. - vital signs? - heart rate, 110. blood pressure, 90/40. i can't close yet, it's not complete. pulse, 130... and climbing. eeg is erratic. he'll fibrillate. 200 mg of metrazene. yes, doctor. - hang on, will. - we've got incorporation, doctor. i'm closing. brain waves are still irregular. the metrazene should have stabilized him. i'll give it 10 more seconds. eeg approaching regular. - blood pressure levelling off. - signs are returning to normal. will, it's beverly. can you hear me? hello. you're going to be alright. how do you feel? i'm fine. you look a little tired, dr beverly. i know this must be disturbing, governor, but you must convince the moons' inhabitants that i am odan. i have his skills, his thoughts, his memories. they will perceive you as a starfleet officer, perhaps with your own agenda. the man they knew as my father, the man who stands before them,... ..both are merely hosts. it is your task to help them understand. i will try. i cannot promise they will listen. they are more factionalised than ever. listening is a skill which has evaporated with the heat of argument. speak softly, governor. those who cannot hear an angry shout may strain to hear a whisper. i will do what i can. well done. escort the ambassador to his quarters. i'm just a little dizzy. i'll be fine. i need to lie down. - picard to dr crusher. - yes? the ambassador is not well. attend to him in his quarters. right away, sir. white cell count is elevated,... six-tenths of a degree temperature. - but no sign of rejection. - that's good. - you look awfully pale. - just a little weak. - and light-headed. - cerebral blood flow looks normal. i'll leave a booster. use it if the symptoms get worse. - beverly. - beyond that i don't know. - this is all new to me. - it is new to me as well. don't go. we have to talk about this. - i don't know what to say. - nor do l. but i know this silence would injure us. you should have thought about that sooner and told me what you were. it didn't bother you to remain silent yesterday. it never occurred to me. this is what i am. did you ever tell me you were only a single being? of course not. that was normal to you. - i don't know who you are! - you must understand, whoever... whoever i seem to be, i am odan, who loved you. that has not changed. i still love you. i can't help that! if this causes you pain, i will suppress it, i will keep my distance. dr beverly,... ..l would never hurt you. may i join you? you know, deanna, the first man i loved unconditionally was named stefan. he was a soccer player and i would watch him race down the field and i thought my heart would stop because he was so beautiful! we married and had three children. twin boys, andrew and alexander, and then later, a little girl, jennifer. stefan became an artist, very famous. he created huge, breathtaking metal sculptures. he came to adore me as much as i worshipped him. in my daydreams at least, stefan was 11 and i was 8. he never even knew i existed. i loved odan, i'm sure of it. i had no doubts, no fears. but what was it i loved? his eyes? his hands? his mouth? they're gone. if that's all it was, i should mourn him and go on. but it was more than that. i felt... completely free with him. unguarded. at ease with myself. so many things made him special to me. where are they? are they still here, alive in will riker? i look at will and i see someone i've known for years. a kind of... brother. but inside,... is he really odan? help me. please! what do your... feelings tell you? i feel his pull. it's very powerful. i wish he'd never come on this ship. don't wish that, beverly. you can't be open to love if you don't risk pain. i don't care. i'd give anything not to feel this way. - he's here, isn't he? - look at him. i don't want to look at him. just keep talking to me. the first man i ever loved was my father. he was strong and tall. he carried me when the ground was muddy. he chased away the monsters that hid under my bed at night. and he sang to me. and kept me safe. and he went away. what i wouldn't give to hear those songs again. to feel his arms protect me. i never will,... ..but i can still feel his warmth and his love as though he were here with me. if you can feel those things,... ..from the man we know as will riker, accept them. accept the love. captain's log, star date 44823. 8. representatives of the two moons of peliar zel have agreed to come on board to meet the new ambassador odan. white cell count is elevated. it's getting higher every time i read it. - are you in pain? - not much. - we can stall the representatives. - they'd see that as a deception. i must meet with them. to present yourself like this will not help our cause. i promise you, they will never know that i am ill. captain, the emissaries. may i present kalin trose of alpha moon, and lathal bine of beta moon. thank you for receiving us, captain. is... this ambassador odan? lathal bine. it was your aunt who represented beta 30 years ago. that is correct. she was a formidable woman. i had the utmost respect for her. and who was it who spoke for alpha so long ago? that was you, of course. kalin trose. then you were a young man, bristling with passion and zeal, yet wise enough to understand that your people needed peace to ensure their future. and how did you achieve a compromise between that young man - and the iron-willed woman of beta? - they traded places for a week, to understand each other's situation with more informed eyes. after that, agreement came swiftly. nothing that you have said is beyond what a school child could learn in a history book. what is not commonly known is that during the negotiations, you, kalin trose, quelled a plot by a radical from your own moon who was attempting to assassinate the beta delegate. it is true. perhaps he was wiser in his youth than he is now. odan, you must convince him to stop. will you accept me? will you allow me to work with you? yes. and alpha moon? i will consider it, but... i must consult others. this is a typical tactic. he is an obstructionist. you can see that. kalin trose,... you may confer with your people, but we must have your answer within eight hours. you shall have it. his immune system is under attack. i can only guess he's suffering from classic rejection syndrome. - is there any treatment? - an immuno-suppressant. it'll relieve the symptoms, but it can't correct the cause. there is a foreign organism in his body. medical school didn't prepare me for situations like this. you're doing all you can. don't worry about me, captain, i'm fine. when you feel up to it, would you join me in my ready room? of course. i can give you something that should help with the pain. at least for a little while. the pain's gone. thank you. please don't. please let me touch you, just for a moment. no! please! it was a fast decision which we must take as positive. the alphan representative has agreed, however reluctantly, to let you mediate the dispute. i knew they would. they are reasonable people, they're just trapped in their anger. have no doubt, however, that they will bolt if something goes wrong. it's my job to see that nothing does. did i say something wrong? no, it's just that... for a moment, you sounded more like will riker. the new host will arrive in 18 hours. - will you be alright until then? - dr beverly's medication has helped. i will find a way to keep going. lemon tea. computer, location of dr beverly crusher? dr crusher is in her quarters. can you make balso tonic? there is no formula on record. please supply a molecular structure. never mind. come in. i thought i should see how you were doing. if you needed another hypospray? i don't think so. the symptoms haven't returned. - well, that's good. - yes. tomorrow's an important day. do you feel ready for it? i'll be fine. i've been preparing. that's good. yes. i'll check your vital signs in the morning before the representatives get here. i don't want them knowing that i'm taking any medication. maybe you could schedule a series of breaks. - that's good. - yes. beverly, i want you. if you are going to leave, go now. i'm not leaving! captain's log, star date 44824.4. governor leka and the representatives are ready to transport. we have learned that they each have troops ready for combat if this final effort at peace is not successful. white count is back up, temperature is elevated. the effects of the medication are wearing off faster every time. i'll administer one now and hope it will hold for an hour or so. no, no more. ambassador, it's clear you're in pain, you can't get through without help. i must. are the injections damaging to riker's body? yes. we can't put him through any further risk. but how can you function, conduct the meeting? i'll manage. we'll respect your wishes. one more thing. i will conduct the mediations today,... ..but at the end of today, regardless of the outcome, i must be removed from riker's body, even if the new host has not arrived. but you won't survive. riker will not survive if i am not removed. he has done enough. your word? very well. - worf to captain picard. - yes, mr. worf? the representatives have returned. i will escort them to the observation lounge. thank you. i'll stand by with medication, just in case. - the pain may become so intense... - beverly. whatever else i may be to you, i'm your friend. i can only imagine what you're going through, and i want you to know... i'm here. jean-luc. - computer, what is the time? - 1535 hours. they've been in there for almost six hours. captain, a message from the ship carrying the trill host. - are they here, worf? - they are experiencing difficulty. they anticipate arriving in another nine hours. nine hours? it was worth it. ambassador! they will not go to war. mr. worf, escort the representatives off the ship. ensign, set a course to intercept the trill vessel. sir, it could take more than two hours to reach. i must remove him. i gave my word. will is gonna be alright. he has stabilized and he's sleeping now. how is odan? i've placed him in stasis, he's fine for the moment. - you need some rest, doctor. - no. if odan is to survive, he needs to be implanted in the new host as soon as he arrives. - it'll be some time. - i know. doctor. is the trill host here? - yes. - good. bring him in. doctor? i am kareel. i am to become host to odan. the operation to implant odan into the new host was completed at 1900, and appears to have been successful. there were no difficulties in assimilation. dr beverly, could we talk for a moment? you should be sleeping, you need to rest. i've never felt better, except once or twice. my poor beverly. this has been so hard for you. i want to thank you, for your caring, for your standing by me. i congratulate you. you averted a war that would have cost many lives. yes. it seems as though everything has turned out for the best. and, yes, i am still odan, and i still love you. i cannot imagine that ever changing. i am glad that you're alright. is there to be nothing more? perhaps... it is a human failing, but we are not accustomed to these kinds of changes. i can't keep up. how long will you have this host? what would the next one be? i can't live with that kind of uncertainty. perhaps, someday,... ..our ability to love... ..won't be so limited. i understand. odan,... ..l do love you. please, remember that. i will never forget you."

surely you could find something more productive to occupy your time. come on, tuvok. lt'll be fun. you think of something- -  species, anomaly or starship- - and l have 15 questions to guess what it is. come on, come on, come on, come on. l would prefer some peace and quiet. how about a riddle? mr. neelix. come on! ha. lt'll be fun. l have no desire for fun. okay, forget fun. a good riddle can stimulate the mind. now, no self- respecting vulcan can say no to that. very well. one riddle. okay, here goes. a lone ensign finds himself stranded on a class- l planetoid with no rations. his only possession... a calendar. when starfleet finds him 12 months later, he's in perfect health. why didn't he starve to death? lt is a theoretical possibility that such planetoids contain hot water springs, which could sustain the man for several weeks. ooh, but not for a whole year. l concur. logic dictates that the ensign in question would perish. aha! ha! l stumped you. as a matter of fact, he not only survived, but his belly was full. why? because he feasted on ''dates'' from the calendar. your answer is merely wordplay. lt has no basis in reality. now, if you'll excuse me. where are you going? to find some peace and quiet. have fun. tuvok to neelix. miss me already, commander? did you activate the aft tactical station? no. why? there appears to be a download in progress. that's odd. l'm detecting anomalous readings. what sort of readings? l'm not certain, but l believe it's a cloaking frequency that consists... commander? tuvok! delta flyer to voyager. mayday! tuvok, what happened? report. he's in neuroleptic shock. l'll need another 20 milligrams of synaptizine. l'll get it. lt's not working. l'll need to try direct cortical stimulation. lnitiate a neurostatic pulse on my mark. right. now! again! his vital signs have stabilized for the moment, anyway. but he suffered severe neurological trauma. do you know what caused it? some kind of alien weapon. by the time l reached tuvok, whoever had attacked him was gone. what about the surrounding space? any indication of cloaked vessels? between trying to tend to the commander and piloting the flyer, l had my hands full. l... l didn't think to scan for cloaked ships. l'm sorry. you saved tuvok's life, neelix. you have nothing to be sorry about. how do you plan to treat him? l won't know until l've run a series of neurological scans. but it would certainly help to know something about the weapon. neelix, these kesat you were negotiating with... any reason to believe they might know something about this? lt couldn't hurt to ask. time to reopen diplomatic channels. deputy lnvestigator naroq, kesat security. captain janeway, commander chakotay, ambassador neelix. you've done your homework. l familiarized myself with the facts on the way here. we're hoping you can help us shed some light on what happened to our crewman. l believe l can. based on the information you provided, it is my opinion that he was a victim of the ba'neth. l've never heard of them. l'm not surprised. ln my language, their name means ''shadow people.'' they're a species obsessed with concealing their identity- - extremely paranoid and xenophobic. well, that explains their cloaking technology. lt's my belief they've been responsible for several unexplained attacks similar to this one. why wasn't l warned about them during my negotiations with your government? because my government's official position is that the ba'neth do not exist. most people think they're a myth. there's nothing mythical about what happened to mr. tuvok. why is your government so skeptical? because there have been so few encounters with the ba'neth. and, well, no one's ever actually seen one. how many encounters are we talking about exactly? before this incident, 12. l guess we're lucky 13. you're lucky l gave my supervisor two bottles of kesatian ale to get this assignment. any other inspector would have simply attributed commander tuvok's injuries to ''unexplained phenomena.'' no offense, mr. naroq, but what makes you so sure the ba'neth aren't just a myth? this incident fits the pattern, captain. all of the alleged encounters have occurred aboard vessels foreign to this sector. l believe they've been attempts by the ba'neth to assess the technology of new arrivals. they were trying to download tactical data. and commander tuvok suffered severe neural damage. that's also consistent with previous attacks. the ba'neth were making sure he would not tell anyone what he saw. maybe that's why tuvok's tricorder was destroyed. they didn't want us to see the cloaking frequency he'd found. he found a cloaking frequency? apparently. captain, l don't blame you for finding my theories a bit eccentric. l'm used to it. lt's why l'm still a deputy investigator. but l've brought equipment to help your investigation. let me examine commander tuvok and run scans on the vessel where he was attacked. l may finally be able to prove my theories. with all due respect, we're more interested in saving tuvok's life. lf we work together, maybe we can do both. his cognitive, memory and logic centers have all been severely damaged. but he still has brain activity, which is more than l can say for any of the previous victims. vulcan neural tissue is extremely resilient. l have no doubt that a brain from a lesser species would not have survived. lf you could only tell us what you saw, mr. tuvok. l don't think we'll be hearing from him anytime soon. keep working. l'll let you know if we find anything that might help. l'll take you to see where the attack occurred. something l can do for you, mr. neelix? l want to help. unless you have a degree in vulcan neurobiology that l'm not aware of, there's nothing you can do. there must be something. my advice is to return to your quarters and get some rest. there's no way that l'm going to be able to sleep knowing that tuvok is lying here like this. there have been rare cases in which comatose patients responded to external stimuli: aromas, touch, voices. so... you're saying that if l stay here and, and try to talk to tuvok, l might be able to provoke some sort of response. lf anyone can provoke tuvok, mr. neelix, it's you. good morning, tuvok! l brought you a few more items from your quarters to help liven up sick bay. your kal- toh game, in case you decide you're ready for a match. oh, and l also thought that you might enjoy a recitation of that classic proto- vulcan drama, clash on the fire plains. l'll be performing all 23 parts myself. uh, l also brought you some flowers from airponics bay. oh, that's fragrant, isn't it? uh, perhaps you'd enjoy some vulcan incense. now, how about some music? computer, access vulcan audio file, selection 56- alpha. mr. neelix, what is that dreadful noise? the chants of the monks of t'panit. personally, l think it's dreadful, too, but it's one of tuvok's favorites. l appreciate your efforts, mr. neelix, but l'm trying to analyze his latest neurological scans and this music is very distracting. you said l was supposed to stimulate his senses. l said stimulate them, mr. neelix, not annihilate them. computer, pause music. thank you. doctor. tuvok! you've had an accident. you're in sick bay. relax, commander, l only want to scan you. don't worry, tuvok. he's only trying to help you. lt's only a tricorder. see? l- it won't hurt you. now try it. well done, mr. neelix. commander chakotay says you've found something. that, captain, is an understatement. listen. what is it? the sound of history being made. less poetry, mr. naroq, more facts. the sound you're hearing indicates the presence of veridium isotopes. residual particles from the ba'neths' cloaking field. you've detected these isotopes before? yes, but only after they've decayed. you see, veridium has a very brief half- life- - less than 70 hours. the previous sites l've studied have been months, sometimes years old! but these isotopes are still active. we can use mr. naroq's photolitic converter to illuminate them. so you see, captain, why this is an historic moment? we may finally learn what the ba'neth look like. well, let's see what we've got. you don't know how long l've waited to meet you. so, the ba'neth aren't a myth after all. this is the clearest image ever captured! perhaps. l believe l can adjust our internal sensors to improve it. what are you doing? what are you... you might disrupt the image entirely. tentacles! l always suspected they were multipeds. doctor to the captain. please report to sick bay. l'm on my way. seven... if we can integrate mr. naroq's photolitic technology into the deflector array, we might be able to de- cloak a ba'neth ship. the technology only works at close range. we have to find the ship before we can expose it. we still need that cloaking frequency. one step at a time. the vulcan brain- - a puzzle wrapped inside an enigma, housed inside a cranium. tuvok's neural pathways have begun to bypass the damaged tissue. they're forming new synaptic connections. ln effect, his brain is rewiring itself. whether this is due to my neurostatic therapy or neelix's rehabilitation regimen or some combination of the two, l can't be certain. ls there any chance he'll make a full recovery? lt's much too soon to say, but he's alert and he's already regained his basic motor skills. but still no speech. lt's only a matter of time, captain. look how far he's come already. l hope you're right, neelix. but if he could talk, he might be able to tell us something about that cloaking frequency. we're not sure how much he recalls. for that matter, we're not certain he recognizes any of us or even knows who he is. l'm going to take him on a tour of the ship. the doctor thinks that familiar sights and sounds might get the old synaptic juices flowing. don't worry, captain. tuvok will be back to his old self before you can say, ''live long and prosper.'' l've brought a visitor. good to see you up and around. you remember commander chakotay. we were just running a shield diagnostic. would you like to take a look? this is tactical station, where you work. just keeping it warm for you. hope you don't mind. that's the shield array. this controls the tractor emitters. l think he remembers it. whoa, whoa, whoa! you just activated the photon torpedo banks. that's all right, tuvok. everybody makes mistakes. we'll be back later. last... but not least... your quarters. you spend a lot of time here, reading... meditating... mr. paris once referred to it as the ''vulcan vault.'' ahh... well, look around, explore. astrometrics to the bridge. mr. naroq and l have completed our deflector modifications. we're ready to test the array. stand by. reduce speed to one- quarter impulse. harry, full power to the deflector array. aye. all right, seven... do it. activating the deflector. l'd call that a pretty successful test. they've been watching us all along. hail them. which one? there's practically a fleet out there. this is captain kathryn janeway of the federation starship voyager. we intend you no harm. they're charging weapons. shields. they're scrambling, captain, in all directions. follow the lead vessel. lt's okay, tuvok. l'm here with you. everything is going to be all right. you're safe with me. still no response to our hails. l hate to ruin a good chase, but the ba'neth ship is moving out of the deflector's range. seven, can you get their cloaking frequency? they're blocking our scans. we've lost them. they're gone now, tuvok. l told you you'd be safe. yes... you did. tuvok? what? tell me, what did l do? you told me... l wouldn't be hurt. do you know who l am? you are neelix. l'm safe... with you. we need tuvok to tell us anything he can remember about the attack. captain, he may be talking again, but that doesn't mean he's ready to be interrogated. he's beginning to experience emotions- - volatile ones. during this last encounter with the ba'neth, he was terrified. we'll tread lightly, l promise. all right, tuvok, you can come in now. lt's nice to see you. captain janeway. that's right. this is mr. naroq. please sit down. two days ago, you were aboard a shuttle with mr. neelix. you detected a cloaked intruder. he attacked you. yes... th- that's why l'm having difficulty now. yes, and in order to help you, we have to find the people who hurt you. before the intruder injured you, you managed to scan him with this. you recorded his cloaking frequency, but the tricorder was damaged and the information was lost. can you tell us anything about that frequency? try to remember. l was scanning. that's right. what did you see? l... l don't remember. try! all right, that's enough. we're done for now. but, captain... join seven of nine in astrometrics. see if she's made any progress with the ba'neth. well, uh, we should be going, too. a few of the crew have offered to help with tuvok's rehabilitation. l thought we might have lunch later, just the two of us. l prefer to stay with neelix. oh, tuvok... l'm- l'm sure that you would... lt's all right. you two go ahead. l have a lot of work to do anyway. oh... the object of the game is to turn this jumble of rods into a perfect sphere. we take turns positioning our pieces. whoever gets the shape to appear first wins. l like the way it looks now. what do you say we give it a try? this has always been one of your favorite games, tuvok. lt helps keep your logic sharp. l'll go first. now you. go ahead. l don't like this game. when you first taught me how to play, l wasn't very good, either, but you kept encouraging me and pretty soon, l scored my first kal- toh. lt just takes practice, that's all. try again. you can do it. l don't like this game! the doctor helped me access my personnel file. nice picture. you should see mine. lt's awful. l was an instructor at starfleet academy. l've received 17 commendations for valor. l'm a husband... a father. you're an extraordinary fellow, tuvok. l was an extraordinary fellow. you're still the same person. then why do l no longer work on the bridge? we talked about that. you had an accident. and now l'm not smart enough. tuvok, you've just got to be patient. look how much progress you've made already. he... could dismantle a photonic warhead in... in less than 30 seconds. l can't even play kal- toh. lt's going to take time, but you'll relearn all those things. how do you know that? well, because the doctor... the doctor? the doctor doesn't know how to make me better! does he? well, not yet, but... l'll never be him again! you don't know that. the vulcan mind... l'm not a vulcan! not anymore! what's going on? lt's okay, doctor. l can handle this. please, tuvok, try to relax. everything's going to be fine. no! nothing's fine! get away from me! you'd better go. now, mr. neelix! l'll take it from here. oh, sorry; l didn't mean to interrupt. you didn't. yes, l did. you were pondering... something difficult, by the looks of it. anything l can help you with? unlikely. try me. how do you find something that's invisible? the ba'neth. we have the ability to illuminate them, but to do so, we must first locate them, which we cannot accomplish without their cloaking frequency. that's quite a riddle. one that we might be able to solve if commander tuvok could tell us what he saw. how is his rehabilitation progressing? well, l thought it was going great, but now... let's just say that l've got a riddle of my own. try me. all right. when is a vulcan no longer a vulcan? when his genetic code is sufficiently altered. no. l- l- l was speaking metaphorically. ln that case, a person is no longer vulcan when he's lost his logic. right! and how does he get it back? he must be taught. exactly, but what if he's brain damaged and emotionally unstable? how does he learn? lt may be impossible for him to learn what you're trying to teach. well, thanks for the pep talk. l was merely suggesting that you adapt to the circumstances. what circumstances?! are you saying that the, the tuvok l know is gone- - that l should stop trying to help him? when l was separated from the collective, l, too, was damaged. l was no longer connected to the hive mind. l lost many abilities that l had acquired as a drone, but l adapted. because captain janeway didn't give up on you. she kept trying to help you. but not by restoring me to what l'd been- - by helping me discover what l could become. what are you making? a flower. lt's for you. thank you. l'm not sure l deserve a gift. l shouldn't have shouted at you. l was angry. l'm sorry. you were frustrated. l don't blame you. l'm the one who should be apologizing. why? because l was pushing you too hard. l was trying to mold you into something you weren't. you were disappointed in me because l can't do anything as well as l did before. maybe there are things that you can do better. what can l do better? well... this, for example. you would've considered it an ''illogical use of your time.'' lt's not good. no, it's wonderful. lt's... creative. lt's a symbol of friendship. before your accident, you never would have considered that my feelings might have been hurt. you, you would have certainly never have made me a gift. we weren't friends? well, uh... we were colleagues, and l certainly felt affection for you. but l didn't return those feelings. you... tolerated me. l don't understand. you said things like ''mr. neelix, please contain your exuberance.'' and, uh, ''mr. neelix, l have no desire for fun.'' and you never smiled. you got a much better sense of humor now. l like to smile. me, too. l don't want to play kal- toh anymore... or- or meditate... or... work on logic problems. you don't have to. what can we do instead? whatever you want. teach me things that you like to do. here we are- - a triple- chocolate wikki fruit sundae with warm fettran sauce. fettran sauce on... a sundae? wait till you taste it. and you really made this? as neelix says, dig in. mmm... this is great. this is fantastic. what did l tell you? tuvok has a flair for food. all morning, he's been creating new recipes, using combinations of ingredients that l, l never would have imagined. for example... a terra nut soufflé... jimbalian fudge cake with peppermint coulis... sweet leola root tart. mmm! only desserts? how come? they taste good. ha! yeah, you better watch out, neelix. tuvok may put you out of a job. from your mouth to the captain's ears. she must have heard me. what's all this? we're having fun. uh, turns out tuvok is quite the pastry chef. would you like some terra nut soufflé, captain? oh, l'd love some. thank you. oh... that is delicious. l'm pleased that you like it. what are you making now? pistachio cake with parra cream sauce. oh, parra cream's my favorite. then you'll have the first piece. tuvok, have you remembered anything more about what happened on the flyer? l detected a cloaking frequency. yes, that's right. can you describe it? l don't know, l, l... did it have a symmetric modulation? was the amplitude constant? l- l don't understand. lt's all right. l don't mean to push you, tuvok, but maybe if we could... lt's difficult for him, captain. maybe you can try again tomorrow. this... this is what l saw. what is it? a cloaking frequency. captain's log, supplemental. the computer has analyzed tuvok's diagram and identified the ba'neth cloaking frequency. we've narrowed the search to a handful of systems. here we go, captain. a nine- million terawatt cloaking field in grid 216. nine million terawatts. whatever they're hiding, it's huge. alter course, mr. paris. yes, ma'am. bridge to astrometrics. status. the deflector array is ready, captain. raise shields. aye, captain. we're within range. all right, seven... light them up. lt's an armed outpost. approximately 3,000 life signs, 22 ships. hail them. no response, captain. they're charging weapons. open a channel, all subspace bands. they're firing. cease fire immediately... or l'll transmit the coordinates of this outpost to the kesat homeworld. that got their attention. several days ago, a member of your species attacked one of my crewmen. he was badly injured. ln order to treat him, l need to know more about the weapon that was used. they're responding. audio only. we do not share technology. but you take it from others. the attacker was downloading our tactical database when the incident occurred. we must assess potential threats. paranoid, just as l predicted. ln exchange for information about your weapon, we'll provide you with tactical data on several species we've recently encountered. you can assess their potential threats all you want. the kesat investigator aboard your vessel cannot be trusted. you know about me? you have been attempting to expose us for years. you are a threat. you must be stopped. they're charging weapons again. wait. lt was my photolitic converter that allowed voyager to de- cloak you. lf you give captain janeway what she wants, l'll give you the converter. you can use it to adapt your technology so ours can no longer expose you. l doubt you'll get as enticing an offer from the kesat homeworld. lt would be a shame if you forced me to hail them. we have an agreement. enter. what are you listening to? a selection from tom's jazz database- - it really swings. computer, pause the music. l've been reviewing the holodeck files. l wish to visit the risa water recreation park. will you accompany me? maybe after your doctor's appointment. appointment? the doctor's analyzed the ba'neth weapon, and he's devised a procedure to treat you. you... you should be proud of yourself. l- if you hadn't drawn that picture on the cake, we may never have found a treatment. l wish l never drew that picture. why? because l don't wish to undergo the procedure. you're having preoperative jitters. that's all. don't worry. everyone gets them. just think about it. ln a few hours, you'll be yourself again. l am myself. but... you'll be able to do all the things that you used to do- - work on the bridge, advise the captain. l want to be able to have fun. with you. l won't be able to. will l? well... you won't call it fun. you'll call it ''deriving satisfaction,'' but it's basically the same thing. you'll still experience emotions. but l won't express them. probably not. then how will you know how much l enjoy being with you? you've just told me. we'll still be friends? of course. even if l... merely tolerate you? l'd be lying if l told you that things between us will stay the same. well, then, why? why do you want me to go back to the way l was? because this crew needs its tactical officer on the bridge, and l wouldn't be a very good friend if l ignored that just so that you'd be nicer to me. mr. tuvok, l was beginning to think you weren't coming. l was experiencing preoperative jitters. neelix helped me overcome them. glad to hear it. now, please lie down. l'll see you after the procedure? of course. l'm going to miss him. me, too. hello, commander. mr. neelix. lt's good to see you up and about. are you feeling better? the doctor has approved my return to duty. that's wonderful news. how about a celebratory glass of champagne? tea will suffice. of course. l'm preparing a special dinner tonight, in honor of your recovery. l don't suppose that you'd be interested in preparing one of your famous desserts. l have much more important things to do than engage in the preparation of nutritionally deficient foods. maybe another time. sundays. l beg your pardon? l have given further consideration to your riddle regarding the ensign who survived by consuming the ''dates'' from his calendar. lt occurs to me that he could also have eaten the ''sundays.'' that's a very clever answer, mr. vulcan. but it's not very logical, is it? no."

well uh yes i’d like some information. well of course, you have lost a loved one, eh? well it's rather difficult to talk about. well of course, shall we step into the uh counseling room? thank you. uh please sit down. now... i’d like some information, well about a funeral. well of course uh, at a time like this relatives usually has a number of questions, now i i think you'll find it easier if we fill out this form. -form? -for the necessary details, the uh, disposition of the remains, the, the name of the deceased and and so on. could that wait for later? um i’m really interested in in the arrangements. oh certainly i i understand exactly, shall we start with the uh caskets then? if it's customary... oh certainly, we always want our clients to know exactly what they're getting, so we uh step this way? now uh here's our dignity service, this model has been most popular with our clients, this model not including a floral selection, and a gift to the officiate, would cost uh uh 2600 dollars. -2600? -too expensive? never mind, over here we have something a little bit cheaper, scale to meet the needs of everyone, the uh peerless model, it combines simplicity with good taste. actually, what i had in mind was something more, colorful. -you mean something more elaborate? -yes. oh in that case, allow me to, recommend this, our supremacy service. the casket of finest mahogany, with bronzed embellishments, and lined with quilted satin, our private chapel banked with flowers, music by the finest organist in the city, a service if i may say so fit for a king, and the cost is only 4780 dollars, think of it as a last tribute to your loved one. -i’ll take it. -you will never regret the supremacy service, now, for a few uh necessary details, uh what physician signed the death certificate? well i’m afraid there isn't any death certificate. -no death certificate? -no. -well this is uh, most irregular, but, what is the name of the deceased? well there isn't any deceased, yet. and then leonard i had to get up and i had to drag, myself just as sick as i am all the way to the front door. -mr thompson? -and it was that man from the cleaners. cicero honey now shh, mama's talking. leonard? now listen to me he wanted, the bill for the last two months, now i gave you the, money for that bill then and what did you do with it? did you spend it at that terrible old curio shop? because if you did, leonard you know i’ve told you if you, waste any more of our money that way, oh cicero, oh now shhh. -leonard? -elsie i haven't been to mr bradshaw’s shop for a couple of months, and to, you must know the truth, there was a collection made in the office for one of the girls who had an accident, well of course i gave it to them, i didn't want them to think that my wife just only gave me lunch money, no elsie, i didn't mean it that way, if you would only listen to me, i, -mr thompson? -yeah hold it, what? -mr andrews is waiting it's very urgent. -yes i know, i’ll be right there. thank you. elsie i can't talk to you now, i’ll call you back. all right leonard, you go, but don't think that i’m going to forget this, you have no idea of the value of money i have to drum it into you, you're going to have to realize that money doesn't grow on trees. mr bradshaw? hello? mr bradshaw? well, mr thompson, haven't seen you in quite some time. -well your door was unlocked. -well i was about to close up, what can i do for you? well if you're closing maybe i better come back another time. oh no i wouldn't hear of it. as a matter of fact, i’ve been wanting to get a hold of you, show you some stuff that i got here, -oh good. -here, take a look at this witch doctor's mask, -came on the solomon islands, ugly thing, isn't it that? -yes. -ceremonial mask? -yes it's uh, using the head hunting dance before the tribe sets, out to lop the noggins off a few of their neighbors, -would you like to have it mr thomsom? -no, thanks, i’ve already bought two masks from you. so you have, how so ever here's a little item that you might enjoy, it's a blue gun made by african pygmies, shoots poison darts. -poison darts? -that genuine article, here, you see that brown goo there on the tip? that's the poison, i got this from a french sailor, i haven't even had a chance to clean it off yet, pygmy blows, the dart hits a monkey up in the tree, down comes the monkey dead in the door nail, just a scratch is all it takes. -really? as quick as that? -yep. as a matter of fact maybe i... i couldn't sell it to you till i cleaned it up, can't go around selling people poison darts now could it? -no i guess not. -however, if you want it too wide and lay it away for you. no i’m just looking today, to tell the truth my wife doesn't like my hobby. women, they just don't seem to have the, spirit of adventure do they mister thompson. -they sure don't. -but as long as you're here, let me show you a couple of beauties i got in from persia, here, take, hold it, feel that balance, and it's just as sharp as razor, whyte go into a man like cutting hot butter, yeah, but once you got it in, how would you get it out? i think this will help you mrs thompson. thank you dr maxwell i know it will, and i’d like you to stop in again tomorrow just to check. -yes of course you want me to. -oh i do, because doctor, you don't know how i suffer sometimes, you know that for 15 years i’ve been an invalid because of him, -ever since he took me on that horrible trip to haiti. -haiti? yes, oh that's where i had my accident, he insisted that i go with him and i climb some old ruins, and i got dizzy and i fell, and i was in a cast for months, and then this pain started, doctor, do you think if i got some heat treatments it would help? well mrs thompson if you take my advice... leonard is that you? well come in. you're late leonard. -i had a few things to attend to. -this is dr maxwell. -doctor, my husband. -how do you do mr thompson? i’m glad to have the chance to meet you, i was just telling your wife i think she, ought to have a little exercise such as walking. dr maxwell has been so encouraging. thank you. -until tomorrow doctor. -right, mrs thompson. i brought you milk. another new doctor elsie? you really don't want me to get well do you leonard? years ago dr barns said you should have some exercise. never mind what dr barns said, you're disappointed because dr maxwell is going to help me, you'd just rather i would die wouldn't you leonard? how can you say such a thing? you think i don't know it? ever since you dragged me off to that horrible, trip to haiti you've been wanting me dead, so you could go on your trip to the south seas, or the orient or any one of those nasty little foreign countries. well, elsie i’m sorry about the accident, -i know it's my fault. -you go to that curio shop, and you get out of there and you think you're leonard thomson great white hunter, or something equally idiotic, leonard you're pathetic you couldn't kill a mouse. i might surprise you elsie. the only way that you could surprise me is to act like a man, and you're going to have to, you're going to have to ask for a raise, you're going to have to make more money, you're going to have to hire a real housekeeper because i’m sick of your cooking, and i’m sick of that sloppy cleaning woman who comes here only once a week, you are going to have to take care of me leonard, the way a husband should take care of a wife that he has made a crip of, you know what dr maxwell said to me? he said that if i take care of myself, i can live another 30 years, you hear that leonard? another 30 years. ah mr sims... -mr thompson... -mr sims i want you to handle all the details. -well fine, you still want the supremacy service? -yes, and here is four thousand seven hundred eighty dollars in cash. i want four thousand seven hundred eighty dollars of sim service. why, quite so mr thompson quite so, you will be completely satisfied, -we will outdo ourselves. -i’m counting on that. now for a few necessary details, what is the name of the deceased? you don't have to worry about that now, here's the address, i want you to come by tomorrow evening to collect the body. yes but, this is most irregular. shall we say tomorrow evening at eight o'clock? -eight o'clock? -sharp. look out mr thompson i can't stop. all right, i'll catch you, here we go, there. -thanks mr thompson. -you almost took a tumble. -you dropped something. -oh thank you. what is it? well billy that's called an amulet, that's a good luck piece for somebody going on a trip. you're going on a trip? -yes, i am. i’d like to go on a trip. billy you are on a trip. -me? -of course, you know every day can be a new adventure, someplace else to go, somewhere new to see, and even if you have to stay here in one place, and there are books and pictures that can, take you to the far corners of the earth, and you know billy, it could be a wonderful adventure, you must be careful not to take a wrong turn or, you'll end up in a stagnant swamp, and there's no way out, you try not to do that. i don't understand. well i guess i was thinking out loud, i have to go billy, take care. goodbye mr thompson, have a nice trip. hey mr thompson, if you like to travel, maybe you'd like to come to see the movie. -what movie is that? -at our school, it's about india, my teacher gave me six tickets to sell, they're only 50 cents each. is that all? well, i think i can afford that, -let's see now. -thanks mr thompson, they're the first ones i’ve sold. all right so long. hey mr thompson, you forgot your tickets. billy howard get off my lawn. but i have some tickets for you, it's a movie at our school. i’m not interested now you know, you children are forbidden to come on my lawn. but mr thompson already paid for these tickets, it's a movie about india, tomorrow night. i said i wasn't interested, mr thompson knows that i never go out. i can't i’m not well enough now go on use the walk. if you're not well enough how can you go on a trip? what trip? what are you talking about? mr thompson told me he was going on a trip. he did, did he? and where is this trip to? he said just as far away from here so he could get. where's that? it's no place at all, he isn't going anywhere. thank you. excuse me, do you have some red poison? yes sir, now if you have rats this will take care of them. is that painless? i don't know i never took any. of course, i’m really looking for something that's painless and quick. it sounds like you're planning a mercy killing. here's what you want, now this is the newest stuff, and i’ll never know what hit, all right before you can buy that though, you have to sign a register. what's the reason for that? oh it's it's nothing serious just so we can keep track. -is that you? i want to talk to you. -yes i’ll be right in. how did you get in? i didn't hear the front door open. i came in through the kitchen. snake didn't you mean, well where have you been? i had to work late at the office. you never had to work late before, your job is that important? i have to make some final arrangements. for your wonderful trip? -my trip? -i heard all about it, billy howard told me, now leonard you can forget all about that, there's no money being spent around here on any trip. well, it's too late to change my plans, i’ve quit my job, you what? that's right, it's something i should have done a long time ago, oh look at this, here's the insurance policy, five thousand dollars i’ve cashed it in, and i’ve already spent four thousand seven hundred eighty dollars of it. -you're lying? -oh no, i’m not, job is gone, the insurance is gone, there's 220 left of that money and 20 dollars in our savings account, there would have been more of course but you spent every cent, i ever earned on medicine and doctors for, that illness you seem to enjoy so much? the things is you're having a nervous break... i am not having a nervous breakdown! at last i realize what i have to do, anything would be better than to spend another 30 years, of the kind of life i’ve been leading with you, you've been out with that accident in haiti 15 years ago, you're strong as a horse. stop that, you stop it and you stop being idiotic, you're not going any place because i won't let you. there's nothing you can do about it, i don't know where i’m going exactly, but any place would be better than this. you're out of your mind. there's someone at the door you better answer. me answered? did you hear what i said? answer that door! all right leonard. -hurry up! -all right. good evening madam. what is it? we have come for the body as instructed. the body? yes madam. leonard... i would like to make it clear that the appearance of a suicide on our program, in no way constitutes an endorsement of this, as a solution to life's problems, there are many better means to get out of a difficult situation, money for example, and now i shall return in a moment. that is all for tonight, i wonder if we could leave out commercials now and then, big brother never sleeps, good night."
0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"all right, what's wrong now? this is my analysis of the latest reports from the rangers. we've had a major increase in attacks against shipping lines of alliance worlds. hit-and-run attacks, very efficient. no survivors, no warning. so far, very typical raid... i do not think these are raiders, john. the ships were destroyed with the cargo still onboard? raiders strike quickly, knock out communications and navigational control... ...plunder the cargo bays, then destroy the ships. whoever is behind these attacks isn't interested in cargo or profit. they are not raiders. these attacks are being carried out with almost military-like precision. textbook search-and-destroy missions. do the rangers have any idea who's responsible for this? nope. no survivors, no witnesses and no evidence. the transports were so overwhelmed they didn't have a chance to fight back. well, until now the other worlds probably figured this is just a local problem. when they find out it's this widespread... when do the others get this report? you're required to give the council briefings on matters affecting their security... ...within 24 hours of reviewing them in-house. every member race has been hit equally... ...and the attacks have been totally random... ...so that rules out border skirmishes or political disagreements. there is no one obvious to blame. which means they'll blame each other, randomly. deploy rangers along the main shipping lines... ...monitor all frequencies for distress signals. we have to find out who is responsible for this... ...or we're going to have a real problem. a highly trained but unknown military force striking randomly against our allies? i'd say we already have a real problem. and so it begins. - there's a hole in your mind. - what do you want? no one here is exactly what he appears. commander sinclair is being reassigned. why don't you eliminate the entire narn homeworld? i see a great hand reaching out of the stars. president clark signed a decree declaring martial law. these orders have forced us to declare independence. unless your people get off their encounter-suited butts and do something... you're the one who was. why are you here? i think of my beautiful city in flames. get out of our galaxy! we are here to place president clark under arrest. prime minister mollari, so good to have you back. i trust your journey was a pleasant one. not really, no. and i see you've brought your own entertainment with you. an excellent idea. and quite brave of you to let him so close without keeping him in chains. perhaps we should change that. just a few chains to make the others more comfortable before we put him in a cell. he is my bodyguard. well, it's good to know that your excellency's sense of humor... ...is still intact after such a long voyage. well, now, perhaps if we could show you to your room... minister vitari, i wasn't joking. his name is g'kar. and he... he is my bodyguard. and i can find my room very well on my own, thank you. what time is dinner here? - sundown. - good, i'm starved. is that the last of them? good. close it up. yesterday something happened that will change the lives of everyone... ...perhaps even alter the course of the future. most of you know lyta alexander. during the shadow war she served the vorlons... ...acted as their go-between. they adjusted her abilities, made her stronger... ...and revealed the truth to her. and last night... ...she revealed it to us. while some telepaths on other worlds evolved naturally... ...the majority were created by the vorlons... ...through centuries of genetic manipulation. they created us so we could be used by other worlds... ...as weapons in their war against the shadows. that is all we are to them. things to be used and thrown away. all that was bad enough... ...but to find that we would not even be telepaths... ...would not be hunted down and caged and controlled... ...if the vorlons had not interfered with our genetic makeup... ...made us into what we are... byron, what is done is done. we can't change what we are. no, we can't. but if we are what we are because we were made this way... ...then i have to say to our makers, ""you are responsible."" the vorlons are gone. the vorlons, the shadows, they're all gone. - there's no one left. - yes... ...but their legacy remains. we are that legacy. a legacy created with one purpose. to serve the other worlds in a war that is now over. which leaves us where? abandoned? alone? no. there is another way... ...but it is dangerous. yes. hello, prime minister. hello, jano. where have you been? i've been asking for you. i was away. i only just now learned of your return. - i hope this isn't a bad time. - no, just having a drink before bed. - here, sit, my old friend. - thank you. it's good to see you again. - how are you? - well. sheridan's new alliance is keeping me very busy. i have come back just to see how things are doing here. how is the regent? - not well, they say. - they say? - haven't you seen him? - he remains in seclusion. officially, only his personal physician and a few trusted aides... ...have seen him for, oh, almost two months. and unofficially? some of the staff have found him wandering the palace late at night. they say he talks to himself. cries, wails, curses... ...and then falls silent when somebody approaches. sometimes he says he has something important to tell them... ...and then a cloud seems to pass over his face, and he walks away. once, before he could be brought to his room... ...he told a guard to kill him, that he was not himself. of course, he was quite drunk at the time. was he? i find that very strange. i've known the regent since i came to the royal court. he doesn't drink. he cultivated sobriety as his only vice. a break with conventional, accepted behavior. - perhaps he's changed. - perhaps. well... things do seem quieter than when cartagia was in charge. oh, quieter, yes, yes. but also stranger. i was updating the status report on our fleet, standard protocol... ...when an aide to the regent told me to stop. he said that information was for the regent only. and other reports too. grain production, food supplies, ore production... ...have all been reclassified as top secret. - why? - i don't know. nobody does. it's a strange thing, londo. it's a feeling more than anything i can point to. as if a darkness had fallen over the palace. i've never felt anything quite like it before. but i'm glad you're back, londo. if anybody can find out what is going on, it's you. and while the regent can refuse to see me... ...it would be very hard to avoid seeing his own prime minister. all right, jano. keep an eye out for anything else you might consider strange. let me know what you find out and i will bring it to the regent myself. perhaps it's nothing, just whispers and rumors... ...but just once i would like to find myself wrong about these things... ...for a change. - good night, londo. - good night, jano. see you in the morning. oh, yes. lights. lights! who's there? regent? - is that you? - yes. yes. so they tell me. now, what are you doing here? why, i came to see you, lord jano. why else? certainly not the décor. once i would have thought... ...pastels for the curtains. but i think we're well beyond pastels now. no. no bright colors anymore. just darkness. i remember... ...when you were just a child... ...emperor turhan once picked you up... ...and carried you all around the palace. - do you remember? - yes, regent, i remember. but you shouldn't be here. it's late. you should be asleep. yes. i suppose i should. but i wanted to see you. i so wanted to see you again. you do understand, jano... ...that if it were my decision... ...i would never let anyone harm you. i would never let anyone hurt you... ...if it were my decision. but it's not my decision, you see. not my decision at all. then it's decided. the yolu government will not oppose the independence... ...of the colonies in sector 800 in exchange for an agreement by the alliance... ...to intercede in all border disputes there for the next 20 years. are there any challenges? good. then the motion is passed. i think that concludes all our business today. thank you for coming. oh, and we have an updated report on the security of your shipping lines. it'll be uplinked to your systems tonight. and now the screaming begins. it's started. there's no turning back now. i'll need you to stay here and coordinate things while i go find mr. garibaldi. in the next 24 hours i'll need you more than i've ever needed anyone. your strength, your wisdom... ...your warmth. byron, aren't you ever afraid? constantly, lyta. constantly. oh, prime minister mollari, good. i'm so glad you've come. i was telling the others about your exquisitely ironic choice... ...of a narn for a bodyguard, but anyone who wasn't there refused to believe me. i could hardly believe it myself. but now that you're here... yes, i am here, and i would like to see the regent. i'm afraid that's not possible, prime minister. the regent is not well. but he did ask me to convey his best wishes to you and your... ...whatever, and to say that he will join us when his strength permits. i see. and where is lord jano? he said he would meet me here. i'm sorry, prime minister... ...it is all i can do to keep my own itinerary straight... ...let alone that of lord jano's. but i will inquire, if that is what you want. yes, please. mollari! this business has gone far enough. the palace guard should be protection enough for anyone. to bring one of those in here is a slap in the face to every centauri... ...who's given his life guarding the palace. and it recklessly endangers everyone here. endangers? how? narns are barbarians. primitives. turn your back on them, they'll stick a knife in it. a narn would never stab a centauri in the back. it has always been our tradition to go for the chest. that way you can see the life go out of their eyes as they fall. just doing my best in the interests of accuracy. so you were in error, it happens. be assured that i do not carry a grudge. no? interesting. i brought someone with me. do you recognize him? yes. this is the centauri that whipped me before cartagia. do you recognize what he's holding? yes. that is the whip he used. i put his fate in your hands. in front of these witnesses, i say that you will not be prosecuted... ...or charged for anything you might do. go on. tell me, minister, if i were to strike you... ...which would you be angry at: the hand that struck you... ...or the heart that commanded the hand to strike? well, the heart, of course. the hand has no choice but to do as it is told. it is the heart that carries the burden... ...and that heart is dead in both of us, minister. it died with cartagia and it died in me soon after. besides... ...everyone knows that the true source of pain is neither the hand nor the heart. it is the mouth. is it not, minister? mollari, i think that you should follow me at once. i just came in to look for him and i found lord jano... ...like that. i shall summon the palace guard. this is a terrible day, mollari. i looked in his eyes when i searched him. this was not a man who would seek death. yes. jano would never kill himself. never. he was murdered! and i appreciate your taking the time to see me, mr. garibaldi. not a problem. what can i do for you? i'd like permission to address the council for the alliance. - about what? - i'd rather not say. - then the answer is no. - it's rather important. then you're gonna have to tell me what it is. look, you've got sheridan, delenn, all the ambassadors from all the member worlds. that's a lot of people, and they're busy. if they're gonna give you five minutes... ...they're gonna need to know why. so if you can't tell me... ...there's nothing i can do. you've had a number of attacks against alliance shipping lines. by now the other races know all about it. - yeah, they're pretty upset about it. - exactly. my information could calm them down, but if i give it to any one person first... ...they'll think it's a trick. it has to be done in front of all of them. and i want to thank the brakiri for their help in rescuing survivors... ...from a burning drazi transport. it is exactly that kind of cooperation that the alliance stands for. all right. if there is no other business... ...we have someone who wants to address the council. byron? i'm afraid i'm going to divert from my prepared comments... ...but this matter is no less important than the one i was expected to address. the reports lyta is handing out contain detailed information... ...on how the vorlons created telepaths on a hundred different worlds... ...through centuries of genetic manipulation. human telepaths were among those created by the vorlons... ...to serve their needs, and yours, during the shadow war. now the war is over and we are abandoned. we belong to no one. we have been caged, pursued and forced into a kind of slave labor... ...all for your benefit. so now i turn back to you and say you must help us. the alliance we were created to serve must now help its creations... ...by giving us and all telepaths a homeworld of our own. byron, you are out of order. now, what you are asking for... is small compared to the sacrifices we have made. there are many habitable worlds on the edge of your territories... ...which have no real value to you. - there is nothing we can do. - what you are asking for... - will be given! for a very long time now we've hidden what we can do... ...all for your sake. that will now change. we do not believe in violence. that is not our way. our way is information. over the last two days, each of you has been followed by one of my people. they have scanned every thought, every secret... ...every hidden thing you would not want known. we now have all your secrets. give us a homeworld of our own... ...and you will never hear from us again. fail to do so and all your secrets will be revealed. never, ever, ever trust a telepath! i swear to you that i'm gonna have that tattooed on the inside of my eyelids. - damn it, i'm sorry... - it wasn't your fault. byron's telepaths have provided us with solid information... ...since you brought them into the covert intelligence division. - you couldn't know they would pull this. - i should've known. don't they understand what they're doing? they might as well have rolled in a grenade. look, they were very smart in not saying exactly what they knew. unless they do a deep scan, a telepath can only pick up... ...what you're thinking at the moment. but who the hell remembers every passing thought they had for two days? leaving everyone to assume they know the most damaging information possible. which begs the question: what are we going to do about it? perhaps they are right. it is true that vorlons guided their evolution... ...creating telepaths for their own purposes, to serve our needs in the war. perhaps we do have an obligation to them. fine. i'll set them up a trust fund. but a homeworld of their own? come on! if you were hated by your own race, forced to join the psi corps... ...or forced to take drugs to inhibit your talents for the rest of your life... ...if you had been hunted and enslaved by the others... ...would you not want a place of your own? a place where others like you could gather safely without fear of persecution? okay, i grant you, on a strictly idealistic level it's understandable. but they did it the wrong way, the inconvenient way. i seem to recall the earth president saying the same thing to you... ...after your civil war. i hate it that she has a memory, don't you? damned inconvenient. well, at least it's still a political problem. so far it hasn't turned violent. yet. is there ever a time when you are not eating, g'kar? as bodyguard, i must keep up my strength. i could be called upon to give my life to save yours at a moment's notice. it's bad luck to die on an empty stomach. we believe that... yes? prime minister, the regent will see you now. i believe you know the way to his private bedchamber. yes. - g'kar? - yes? - i'm glad you had something to eat. - so am i. when i move, run. run! g'kar! g'kar! mollari... ...you should never have come back to centauri prime. you are an obstacle to my ambitions. with one move i remove you. are you all right? - yes, i think so. - good. i suggest we leave the area before others come. i gave very explicit orders that no one was to leave the area... ...until we heard back from the council. - we needed supplies. - he said he'd come right back. - don't you understand? they're afraid of us right now. we have to stay here quietly, peacefully. they have to see we're not acting against them. if they come after us, we'll need supplies. they won't. if we stay together, do nothing to break the laws, security will have to protect us. if we split up, anything can happen. - then we'll go after them. - no. that would only further complicate the situation. we can only hope that... one of your kind violated our ambassador. which was it? - we have to help them. - no. stay here. we cannot return violence with violence. we have to wait. i can't! you said we had to look out for each other, protect each other. we have to stop them! - mr. president. - zack. i assume you heard. we just finished debating the problem. i always wondered what it would take... ...to make all these ambassadors act together. and now i know. that's the worst thing you can do to someone, zack... ...threaten to reveal his secrets. on top of that, now the drazi are claiming their people were attacked by telepaths... ...that threats were made. with everyone already wired up over the attacks on their shipping lines... ...it was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. - i assume captain lochley sent you. - yes, sir. and i assume she reminded you to remind me... ...that she thought this idea of a colony of telepaths was a bad idea from the start. yes, sir. yeah. well, maybe she was right. she wants me to pull them in, but they came here under your protection. she won't contravene that. she needs your authorization before she can take them out. - how many people are we talking about? - well, it's hard to say. they don't have to register as telepaths, they keep to themselves... ...reports are about 50 to 150 people living down there. maybe delenn was right. maybe we do owe them a lot more than we've given them. but there's nothing we can do until we have them in custody. then maybe we can calm things down. as of now, i am withdrawing my protection. you are authorized to move as soon as you are ready. do what you have to do, zack. they'll be coming for us soon. we need to prepare. move all our food stores in here, get everyone together. byron, i can try talking to sheridan. - he'd listen to me. - i'm sure he would. but the situation is almost certainly beyond his control. the other ambassadors will insist on our arrest. then what do we do? go along like sheep when they come for us? no. we will refuse to be arrested, but we will do so peacefully. we'll weld shut all the air doors, block all the transport tubes. they'll have to dig us out inch by inch. what do we do when the food runs out? then we will have nothing to eat. when the other worlds hear of our starving here... ...for the dream of our own homeworld, it may soften their hearts towards us. the longer it takes them to get to us, the more we may have a chance to negotiate. in time, cooler heads may prevail. no! when i was first identified as a telepath, my family said to wait. ""perhaps they won't come for us. perhaps we can work this out in peace."" but they came for me and my sister. and now they will come for all of us. we've spent years on the run, and in those years, we've been free... ...from the psi corps, free from the hatred and the oppression and the fear. how many of you want to go back to that? because that is exactly what will happen if we sit here and wait. then what do you propose? you had the right idea, byron. you just didn't go far enough. we have their secrets. we can fight back. i say we leave here while we can, split up and strike back. make them understand that if they give us what we want... ...we'll go in peace. but if they don't, we fight. - you'll fight? - yes. and kill? if necessary. we took these from the drazi. we can get more. have you learned so little? is there not one of you who understands?! i am staying here. whoever wishes to go can go. i have no hold over you. - byron... - go. while you still can. and i can't tell you how glad we are... ...that you escaped harm, prime minister. how did you manage to escape? well, i live a charmed life. clean living. well, vole was always trouble, you know. yes, even the regent has had difficulty containing his ambitions. well, it won't be a problem anymore. he has overreached himself. - the regent... - and where is the regent? pardon? well, you said the regent was ready to see me. was he or wasn't he? or were you merely setting me up for vole's attempt on my life? you almost had me going there. where is the regent? well, i don't actually know, you see. he was there when i sent for you, but then when i came back he was gone. but i assure you that every possible attempt will be made... ...to locate him just as soon as possible. yes, yes, please, please. thank you. thank you. yes. are you sure? regent. regent virini. hello, mollari. beautiful night, isn't it? as nights go. and they go so quickly now. - are you all right? - yes, yes. no. i'm glad we got there in time to save you, mollari. you know, you were the only one who treated me fairly... ...when cartagia was here. but he's still here... ...isn't he? his legacy. then it was you who saved me? no. not exactly. it was them. they like you, you know. that's why they saved you. they say you are just like them. they say... - they say you have much in common. - they? who are they? quietly, londo. quietly. you will follow me. you will be emperor soon. yes. i'm sorry. i'm so... ...so sorry. they have a message for you. they say, ""we know you have been asking about our supplies and ships."" they say: ""let it go."" you will understand it all soon enough. - no, i want to understand it now. - no! no, you don't. if you have ever believed me before, londo, believe me now. you still have time. enjoy it. run in the sunlight. eat, laugh. like a fool. you have so little time. you should go now. - quickly! - regent... we will speak... ...one more time before the end. go now! go on! well, what did you learn? i don't know. come along. i didn't say anything. l... i didn't say... i didn't... i didn't... - g'kar. - yes? tomorrow morning we will arrange for the first transport back to babylon 5. - i thought you were staying for a month. - yes, so did i. g'kar... ...i have been in the royal palace on and off for most of my life. even when cartagia was here i never lost my affection for it. but tonight, for the first time... ...i think it frightens me. frightens you? well, i won't be getting any sleep tonight. what could they be doing with our ships, i wonder. we beg you, do not fire! we're unarmed! we've done nothing to you! we've done nothing! is this thing on? it is? this is babylon 5 station security to telepaths in brown sector. we are aware that you have sabotaged the transport tubes... ... and welded the access hatches shut. you are ordered to remove these obstructions and surrender at once. failure to do so will result in direct confrontation with our forces... ... and i imagine you don't want that any more than we do. lyta, if you're in there... ... come on out now and we may be able to intercede for you. anyone else who wants to come out, do so now. if you stay... ... if any of you stay there and resist the order of the president... ... that you surrender yourselves and this area... ... we cannot be held responsible for the consequences. you could go, lyta. i don't want to. we can hold them off for a day. two days, maybe three. no more. there will come a moment when i will ask you to leave me behind. when that moment comes, you must do exactly as i say. promise me that, lyta. promise me.

she sent word that it wasn't acceptable to her. - i wonder why. - i know exactly why. once her basic needs are met, she refuses any special assistance. she's extraordinary. sounds like you've known her for years. i feel as though i have. i've pulled all her personnel and medical files. - are her quarters ready? - i've got the bumps to prove it. - thanks, chief. - let me know if there's anything else. it'll be something to see when we switch off the gravity. ensign pazlar reporting for duty. i'm chief science officer jadzia dax and this is... dr bashir. we spoke on subspace. - good to meet you. - you have my trolley car ready. - can i help? - i'm fine, thank you. that's better. you've modified it. i wanted to give you as much mobility as i could. i've been practising on the model i requested. - we can replicate the other design. - no, i'll just have to adapt. i'll be accompanying you on your mission. i'm perfectly capable of piloting a runabout. - commander sisko thought... - what every officer has thought: i need help to get the job done. tell him i don't. he wouldn't allow any ensign to take a runabout a day after arriving. you must have more important things to do than chart the gamma quadrant. here we are. you didn't modify the specifications for my quarters, did you? no, you control the gravity unit with this. thank you. it was a pleasure meeting both of you. paltriss only created 80 of them, each a work of art. i've come into the possession of 42. 42? my world will honour your name for returning the rings of paltriss to his birthplace. as long as your honour is accompanied by 199 bars of gold-pressed latinum. i heard you drive a hard bargain. shall we celebrate our closing the deal with another drink? excuse me. i'm sorry. we're not open yet. if you'll come back... have another drink on me. fallit kot, is it really you? - how long has it been? - eight years. - eight long years. - it can't be! i must say, you look terrific. tanned, toned up. that baby fat has disappeared from your face. you don't keep extra weight on where i've been. just passing through? i bet you have business in the gamma quadrant. i'm not going to the gamma quadrant. my business is here with you. - with me? - that's right. i've come to kill you, quark. i've gone through her profile. she knows what she's doing. this is her first deep space assignment. it doesn't make sense to... here she is. welcome, ensign. i'm commander benjamin sisko. am i late? it looked as though the meeting had already begun. dax and bashir were telling me about your request to pilot a runabout. wouldn't it be more appropriate to include me in that conversation? i was being briefed by my senior officers. we discuss personnel matters all the time. i'm sorry if i seem overly sensitive. i'm used to being shut out of the melora problem. the truth is there is no melora problem... ...until people create one. this may sound ungrateful because dr bashir has been very helpful preparing for my arrival, but i wonder why a medical opinion is necessary in this discussion. julian knows your capabilities better than any of us. i don't need a medical opinion to tell me my capabilities. i won't be treated like i'm ill. - nobody is doing that. - try sitting in the chair. no one can understand until they sit in the chair. i've been in one chair or another since i left my home world. my family gave me this cane, made from the wood of a garlanic tree. they had no idea what it would be like to live in what you call normal gravity. only a few elaysians have left home, but i always knew that i had to be one of them. i dreamt about exploring the stars as a child and i wasn't going to allow any... ...handicap, not a chair, not a cardassian station, to stop me from chasing that dream. you must feel proud of everything you've achieved. i've achieved that, commander, without being dependent on anybody. to be honest, i prefer to work alone. it's simply easier for me. i am not comfortable sending you alone into the gamma quadrant. i can focus on the job better, work at my own pace without being a bother to anyone. lieutenant dax will be going with you. yes, sir. when do you wish to leave, lieutenant? - your schedule is fine with me. - then tomorrow at 07:30. is it working? the low-grav field actuator. - i heard it go off. - it's working fine. so you were just... for me, it's like slipping into a hot tub at the end of a long day. really? i'm a shower man myself. look at this. is this your husband? boyfriend? doctor, if you came for an apology... - i apologise. - apology? my speech wasn't intended to attack you personally. i'm sure you never set out to attack anyone personally, but you seem to attack a lot. - that's insensitive of you, doctor. - julian. - i'm no longer your doctor. - i see. - you've decided i need a friend. - was that an attack? you do it so well, with such charm, it's hard to tell. - i really don't mean to... - sure you do. - i beg your pardon? - of course you mean to. the shots you fire are your way of keeping the universe on the defensive. has to be. you're too good at it. it always seemed to work pretty well. until now. that is the nicest thing you've said to me. or anybody else. are you hungry? i came here thinking about asking you to dinner. - then afterwards we'll go dancing? - red alert. sorry. there's a new klingon restaurant on the promenade, if you like that sort of thing. all right. - dinner is served! - i didn't order dinner. what better way to mollify... ...satisfy a hungry traveller than with a delicious home-cooked meal starting with a delicate vak clover soup? why spoil your appetite with soup? here's the real treat. jumbo vulcan molluscs sautéed in rhombolian butter. a taste so exquisite, it's to die for. or to live for. do you know dabo, fallit? it's a wonderful game and easy to learn. i took the liberty of lining up a couple of excellent tutors. be sure to ask them about their double-down betting strategy. if i haven't made it clear, i intend your stay here to be as pleasurable as you could ever imagine. allow me to propose a toast... to... - ...old friends. - old debts. shall i order for us both? we'll have some racht, of course. and a double order of gladst. no sauce, please. and a side order of zilm'kach. is that too much for two? - may i? - don't be alarmed. - i can't eat this. - i know how it looks... i like a customer who knows what she wants. there's nothing worse than half-dead racht. when i was ten, my father was a federation diplomat on invernia ll. one day, on a remote part of the planet, we were hit by a massive storm. while we waited it out, we found an invernian girl about my age who was sick. after the storm cleared, my father went for help. it was too late. i sat there and watched her die. the next day, when he returned, his guide told us we could have treated her with a simple herb. i could have saved her life. so you started to study medicine. - actually, first i started to study tennis. - tennis? i thought i could make a career out of it. - you must be very good. - i used to think so. then i went to my first competition. my opponent served and the ball bounced past me. the computer said it was good and i was in trouble. turned out i had more talent at medicine than tennis. i have an early mission tomorrow. i'd better get some rest. of course. dax to pazlar. computer, level one security access. ensign pazlar? computer, locate ensign melora pazlar. - docking level 22, section 14. - section 14? - we need to get you to the infirmary. - it's my own fault. i decided i could use an extra astrometric array after going through the mission profile. i came to storage to get one. i wasn't paying enough attention to what i was doing. my boot didn't make the lip of the door. i fell on my controls. dax to bashir. ensign pazlar's had a minor accident. - we need you in the infirmary. - acknowledged. what kind of architect would design a raised rim at the entrance to every door? so much for the gamma quadrant. i didn't even make it there. there's no concussion. you can reschedule your mission for tomorrow. it was so... flopping back and forth like a broken toy. i didn't want anyone to find me like that, but i couldn't get up. why didn't you wait for dax before going in? i didn't need dax. if i'd just paid attention. melora, no one on this station is completely independent. in space, we all depend on one another. i just want you to know that you can depend on me. you've proven that. what do the rest of us have to do to convince you? - of what? - that you can depend on us. have you heard of nathaniel teros' work with low gravity species? neuromuscular adaptation. it had no practical success. a lot of progress has been made in neurochemistry since then. you think some day i could throw away the chair? theoretically, perhaps. would you like to come in? no, i know how you look forward to turning down the gravity. don't let that stop you. you may want to brace yourself until you get used to it. come on, julian. - what do i do? - give a gentle push. it's easy. this is astonishing! i can't tell you how curious i was about this. most people are. they make me feel like a carnival attraction. - i prefer to keep everyone out. - thank you for letting me in. - he's my brother. - who? oh. - setting course 28, mark 142. - confirmed. computer, any vulcan études on file? affirmative. if you have no objections. computer, play something by delvok. delvok never seems a vulcan to me. there's too much emotion in his music. it's pretty. tell me something, lieutenant. you think there's room for romance in starfleet? - i think so. - you've made it work? - now and then. - i mean really work. really work? for that i'd have to go back 150 years. that's a long time. could it be that dr bashir's bedside manner has won you over? our species are just so... different. when did that stop anyone? i knew a hydrogen-breathing lothra who fell in love with an oxygene. how could they even be in the same room? 40 minutes a day without their breathing apparatus. 57 years they were together. what about career conflicts? two friends of mine got engaged but were assigned to different starships. subspace relationships? that's a tough one. they may not be together for a year and then for only a few weeks. love across light years. it's just so... - it lacks intimacy. - you could say that. i finish my mission here, i move on to the next one. what kind of future is that for a romance? look at the alternative. i guess. oh, it's you. - don't be so happy to see me. - all right, i won't. odo, there's a desperate criminal on board the station. you're not talking about fallit kot, who got eight years at a labour camp for hijacking romulan ale and whose name appears next to yours on the indictment? i had nothing to do with the hijacking. i was only the middleman. trafficking in stolen goods should have got you your own cell at the camp. unless, of course, you sold out your partner. i can honestly say justice was served. i imagine that fallit kot is looking for his own kind of justice now. he threatened to kill me. - what? - nothing. - just a passing thought. - odo, he means it. nothing i do seems to change his mind. you've got to do something. i'll do my job, quark. unfortunately. - racht, anyone? - i've got something to show you. what is it? an elevated neural output from the brain's gross motor cortex. it's stimulating acetylcholine absorption. - neuromuscular adaptation? - it was a theory until the development of neo-analeptic transmitters. no one has re-examined the ideas of nathaniel teros. until now. this... could actually work? no more servo controls, no more chair... - have i done something wrong? - not that i'm aware of. - we have something in common. - we do? i don't like quark, either, but i can't let you kill him. did he tell you i was going to do that? i know of your history together. let bygones be bygones, i always say. and i always say you can tell a man's intentions by the way he walks. how do i walk? like someone carrying a lot of weight on his shoulders. must be the memory of those romulan bricks i carried. must be. but you can't lock a man up for the way he walks, can you? well? i'd say he's a man with nothing to lose. i have no reason to hold him for now and he knows it. i'll watch him the best i can, but carry a combadge. call me at the first sign of trouble. what if the first sign is the last sign? you people sell pieces of yourself after you die, don't you? i'll buy one. - my heart is pounding. - i hope that has to do with me. would that also explain why my backside is getting warm? that's neuromuscular tissue stimulation due to increased motor cortex activity. i'd say that's enough first time out. it's good to use your muscles in this gravity environment. - feel any different? - no. - nothing at all? - i'm sorry, julian. the acetylcholine absorption is at 14% above normal. increased tensile strength would be the result. i can lift my leg. your neural pathway's beginning to adapt. endurance and coordination might take a while, but you should be walking within the hour. - how's the upgrade coming? - we've got it to about 70%, but it looks like that's... i'll be damned. i wanted to give you our mission summary myself. - a pleasure, ensign. - julian, how did you...? i increased output on the brain's motor cortex. someone else's research, actually. you'll get your name in the medical journals. i don't know how to tell you this, but i'm not sure... it's just the first treatment wearing off. nothing to be concerned about. i'd better get you back to your quarters. habitat ring, level 14. with each treatment, you should get stronger and the effects should last longer. what about this? a low-grav environment now would confuse your motor cortex. i understand. julian... you let me fly for the first time. i let you walk. we're even. i'll see you in the morning. lights. computer, turn on... no one can hear you, quark. it's just you and me. i wasn't prepared to entertain this evening, but make yourself at home. - i already have. - what's mine is yours. i'm tired of your gifts, quark. all i want is your miserable life. wait! everything's negotiable. believe me, i'm worth much more to you alive. how does 199 bars of gold-pressed latinum sound to you? it's a start. the mattress felt like rocks. my muscles ached all night long. you'll adjust to that. this time the effect should last for several hours. exactly when does this become irreversible? melora, if you're not certain... it's just some strange form of buyer's remorse. i'll be fine. tell me exactly what you're feeling. last night, i just missed... i didn't feel like me. if you want to end your dependence on the chair and the servo controls, you'll have to give up the low-grav environment. it seemed like a good trade, until i realised i couldn't do it any more. i'm concerned that going back and forth could lead to a loss of fine motor control. meaning? your ability to perform complex tasks could be affected. the effects are reversible for the next few days. we can pull the plug at any time before then. but after that, your motor cortex impulses will kick in on their own. permanently. it's starting to wear off again. i don't understand myself. how could i possibly have second thoughts? this would mean real independence. it's everything i ever wished for. then i start to think about home and how i won't be able to go back. maybe just for a short visit, but never really go back. ""the little mermaid."" - mermaid? - it's an earth fable by hc andersen. she trades her magical life under the sea for a pair of legs to walk on land. didn't she live happily ever after? ashrok. right on time. may i present my long-time business partner, fallit kot? for your inspection. exquisite. - then our transaction is complete. - not quite. - i'll take them, too. - they warned me about you. a deal is a deal. rule of acquisition number 16. you got what you came for. be reasonable. pick it up. hurry up! move! let's go! security to level 22, section 5. julian will understand. he can publish the results of the first treatments. both of you, back in the ship. move it! come on, move it! - get us out of here. - do as he says. - i'll wait in the back. - the front, where i can see you. she needs motor support in our gravity. they're in the orinoco. docking clamps have been released. ready a tractor beam, open a channel. this is commander benjamin sisko. return at once. - no reply. - engage the tractor beam. they've locked onto us with a tractor beam. release the ship or i'll kill a hostage. i'm willing to negotiate, but first... didn't you hear what i said? no, i have something special in mind for you. do i make myself clear? release the ship now. doctor, chief, with me. beam us to the rio grande. on ten seconds, disengage the tractor beam. understood. energising. - they've released us. - through the wormhole. - what was that? - i'm not sure. another ship coming through the wormhole. - take us to warp. - we haven't set a course yet. if we don't set a course, we could warp ourselves into oblivion. set a course. just get us out of here. - they're powering up their warp drive. - stay with them. engaging warp engines. - can we beam them aboard at warp? - i wouldn't recommend it. - get the phasers ready. - i'm not going to fire at them. you'll do it or you'll die. it's your choice. fine. then i hope you can fly this ship. just sit down and do what i told you. now. quark, how well do you know this man? we've been friends for years. then explain to him that starfleet isn't going to stop chasing us. you don't know these starfleet types. then we'll all die. great! we escape and he's got something special planned for me. we don't escape and i die. am i missing a choice here? - they've dropped out of warp. - go to impulse. - their gravity generators are off. - melora's alive. gravity has been reinstated. all engines are down. come on, doctor. we have the situation in hand, commander. sisko to rio grande. everything's under control. setting course for the wormhole. - why didn't the phaser kill me? - i don't know. - maybe all the neuro-stimulants. - that's what i was wondering. it might make an interesting side effect of the treatment. julian... i'm not going ahead with the treatments. you can always try again some day. i don't think i will. i like being independent. but to give up everything i am to walk on land... i might be more independent, but i wouldn't be elaysian any more. i'm not sure what i'd be. maybe independence isn't all it's cracked up to be. i like being dependent on someone for a change. i'm glad you got me to unlock the doors to my quarters so i could finally let someone into my life. so am i. you must be exhausted. if you don't want to stay... let's just sit a while and listen. i want to remember all of this."
0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"good evening ladies and gentlemen. wanted for everything this is one instance when two heads are not better than one. however i don't believe people realize, what a happy lot we criminals have. what could be better than to be wanted. it gives one the inner security of knowing he has a place in society. that he is popular and sought after. no wonder criminals buy with each other, to be among the top ten. tonight's story is called, ""outlaw in town"" and most of it takes place, in the last chance saloon. it should follow immediately. but i have promised my sponsor first chance. outlaw in town well boys how you like the weather? outside it's snowing and blowing. thousands of our cattle are freezing stone cold dead. and in the face of that this red crested bobbling has the gall to, walk in there and ask us how we like the weather. how would you like a good solid smack on the bugle? i don't think i care for it thank you. shout out 40 rod if you please bartender. out here we call our poison red eye. the only ones which call it 40 rod are texans and other foreigners of that. wwhere you from mister? oh i just wrote in over the north trail. which if you did you just performed a feat unparalleled in the history of buffalo bend. -how so? -to the north to here lies buffalo mountain. not even a big horn sheep could come, down the sheer face of that cliff especially in a blizzard. does it make any special difference just how i got to your miserable little metropolis? no, it don't. but i found out that when a man lies about where he come from. he usually had to leave there in a hurry. i don't care where you're from or what you've done i just don't like liars. i see. well now this calls for some sort of physical action. oh don't fight boys. you ever hear of an old engine proverb? -yeah. -well you're gonna hear it again doc, from an authentic old engine. never fight over anything, that you can eat make love to or put in your pocket. now you stay out of this mini red wing. this year jasper has just insulted my civic pride. and i want to kill him just a little bit. was this what you were fumbling for mister? which the son of a gun steals my sixth gun before i can bat an eye? that's a trick and gun fight i never encountered before mister. what'd you pick up the knack i handled other people's personal firearms upset? no it's nothing really. i hereby proclaim that this here stranger just performed a feat, unparalleled in the history of buffalo bend. he came down a face of buffalo mountain in a blizzard. my name is bart mccormick so, what do they call you? -some people call me tony. -tony waht? where i come from little man it's, considered bad manners to ask a stranger his last name. unless he volunteers the information. do you really want to know little man? not specially. but i uh i've seen your mug somewheres mister. that's shasta cooney, but don't waste your time on her dunk. she may be prettier than me but, i have a warm generous heart. name's tony. can i do something for you? -i was wondering if you'd care to buy a lady a drink? -oh i sure know would. -what is she? -i was referring to myself. are you really a sure enough lady? how would you know? you never even met one before in your whole life. -not even at home. -if you're one oh i should not have. i've been bumping into ladies in bars and such all over the west. but in my simple ignorance i didn't recognize them. i always thought a lady was somebody who, wouldn't be caught dead badging drinks in a place like this. i'll have you know that i do not deal in, sell trade or give away anything that cannot be pulled out of a bottle anyway, out here ladies gotta earn a living somehow. especially a widow lady. my husband was killed in texas by a bandit more than a year ago. i was dealt that hand before. only this girl said her husband had been killed by a sheriff. she had eyes like you and hair like you and she talked like you, and being young and unsophisticated, and i believed her. -so? -so one day i found myself minus my money my silver spurs, and my belt buckle. i had to walk out of town. she also stole my horse. seeing as how i never accept anything, from a gentleman i cannot fit in my suitcase. i am not interested in your horse mister. just your silver spurs and your belt buckle and whatever else you got in your poke. now that the card's on the table, would you care to try your luck? well i like to buy you a drink at that chester, unfortunately i just spent my last dollar at the bar. i'm broke. well there's still room in my suitcase for your silver spurs and your belt buckle. i happen to value my silver spares and belt buckle even more than i do the, pleasure of your continued company shinsta. how would you like to play out that hand? minie red wing this poor man's broke and he's thirsty. give him a small beer and put it on my tab. oh and minie, he's probably hungry too. throw in one pretzel. tae quad. in his case beggars can't be choosers. drink up mister. sirs are right for being so tight, but your credit's good with me duck. you can have anything you asked for. you name it and if i haven't got it i'll go out and get it. -no thanks minnie i'm not thirsty. -you're a man after my own heart tony. if you should wish another drink even, for the purpose of pouring it down shasta cooney's neck. -it's on me. -no i don't accept drinks i can't pay back. but uh, i would like to play some poker. -well what are you gonna use for money doc? this. oh if this is a stick up i won't resist. you can have anything on the premises and that includes me. -i'll go peaceful. -it isn't a stick-up minnie. i'm just going to put up my sixth gun for the stake in the game. i'll call with my sixth gun and, i raise my belt holster and cartridges. that's all for me. -what have you got? -three aces. four trays. but now that he ain't armed i'll explain to you why he's so, bashful about telling where he come from. he's from texas, and his name's tony lorca alias the whistling kid. and if you don't believe me take a look at this here poster that i found on the post office. boy that sure enough is a picture of you tony. that describes you too. donny of spurs, a fancy buckle, haven't you got a whistle when you're in the mood to kill. i want a dead or alive from mail robbery stagecoach holdups bank robbery murder, desertion, treason. arson mayhem manslaughter and kidnapping. not to mention cattle rustling, horse stealing, and a theft of 100 meals from the u.s cavalry. oh my goodness, seems to me the only, crime you ain't got around the commitment is hurting sheep. -i deny everything. -what's he accused of? everything. this here is the whistling kid. -which is real monika's tony lorca. -tony look, you're the man the texas sheriff wrote me about. you killed my husband. if i did you have my commiserations but not my apologies. the only man i've ever killed were those, who were trying to turn me in for the reward money. don't look at me. well... i wouldn't i wouldn't think of taking you to the u.s marshall at center city. like it says to doing that their poster. even if the uh reward money is five thousand dollars. five thousand dollars? well what are you waiting for? he is no i'm somebody take him into custody. which if anybody tries it he's able to get his teeth shot out with his own gun. -besides i don't need five thousand dollars that much. -well i do. anyway reward money is rightfully mine. now how do you figure that? -i found that poster, didn't i? -it was my husband he killed, wasn't it? the whistling kid ought to be community property for all of us to participate in. -share and share like. -now that's socialism. i say that the reward money should go to the man who earns it. i don't want to butt in but would anyone be interested... you stay out if this. now somebody grab him before he tries to get away. he won't get very far. i just came in from the south and the only pass out of town is closed. hmm, well looks like you'll be with us for some time son. meanwhile i freely offer to finance your creature comforts and whatever luxuries the town affords. i never accept money i don't earn. oor steal it. i don't think you cost me much son. one of these horned toads is a cinch to shoot you in the bag for the reward, before you can run up much of a bill. now that's a consolation. here i am worth five thousand dollars, and i haven't got the price of a pint of beer or a plate of beans. i am a certified check i can't cash. i'll cash you. -at a discount of course. -why whatever do you mean shasta? if i advance you the money for grub and booze, will you let me turn you into the marshall and center city, when the road's clear? that's the most immoral proposition i ever heard of. -you're asking me to sell my own life. -it's better than giving it away. like bart says, somebody like to shoot you in the back. this way you get to spend some of your own reward money on yourself. hmm... what would be a joke on the government, wasn't it. what's uh your offer shasta? well seeing as how you killed the only husband i ever had i'll be generous. -fifty dollars0 -i'd rather be shot in the back. all right i hereby agree to shasta coon's deal but not her terms. now here i stand before you gentlemen look at me,  worth five thousand dollars. all i ask is a mere piece to see me from my last few days on earth. come on what am i doing. huh? -i'll make it sixty dollars. -i have sixty dollars away, here 70. personally i haven't got 60 cents in cash but i do own 600 merinos. -i'll bid 65 sheep. -now you say i killed, your husband shasta. are you going to let someone else, have the honor of turning me over me over to the hangman? two hundred dollars. oh my bitch anytime i pay 600 sheep for a man i want them alive awake and available. all right the last bid was 500. do i hear 600? 600. 700. -800. -oh the little lady really wants to see me hang. -what's it worth to you zack? -900 dollars. shasta? 800 dollars is all i have in cash. -i refuse to dip into my suitcase. -sold! for 900 dollars. ah i'm so sorry shasta. but i'll make it up to you. i'll see that you get an invitation to the hanging. i wouldn't miss that for anything in the world. waste of it all. a horrible waste. what's wasteful about? it business being, what it is those girls haven't had a full meal in weeks. -spending money that's rightfully mine. -i don't know how you figure that. and what do you expect him to do with the money, save it for his old age? don't forget there's a rope waiting for him shasta. -that's a consolation. -but don't console me none. he's too pretty a pale face to die with his tongue sticking out. -george i'd like to ask you about... -zach you better ride hurt on him. government isn't going to pay you any, reward money if he eats himself to death. i rightfully don't care what happens tony now i sold him. -you sold him? -well, that is i sold my, rights for the reward money to avoid for a thousand dollars worth of hay. anything illegal about that judge? well i being a mere justice of the peace i'm not sure but, i am sure that i hope you haven't set a precedent. excuse me. don't think i'm neglecting you shasta. here. champagne. it's a genuine french article. and don't you think that you can buy my, friendship with any just being trumped out of a grape. take your champagne. considering their enemies and he still kisses her like that. i wonder what he'd do if they were friends? it should happen to me. put that on my tab. hey... hey somebody bring a hooker a red eye shasta's done faded. why that big brute crush the wind out, over here this water ought to do it. keep it up maybe she'll drown. -a new all-time high. -hey tony lorca stock sure enough here. well who owns tony lorca now? -bill younger. -now that pass has been open for a whole day. why don't bill just take him over to center city and cash him in. well that's a long trip besides bill is, hoping to turn tony over for a quick profit. well now who'd be silly enough to pay more in 37.50 for tony under the circumstance. -what's silly about us? -who are you? i'm trigg owens. this is pac muntz. we represent, a syndicate out of the town of o'leary's laps. we just paid 4500 for tony lorca. in case anybody's interested the new price is 7000 dollars. well that's 2000 over. the government only offers 5000. well if the government wants any part of, the whistling kid they'll have to pay our price. after all we got a corner on the market anyway. yes, but can you deliver the goods. how do you know that tony hasn't arranged with a gang of his to hold you, up and snatch him away from you on the way to center city? i'll bet you anything that's just what tony's got up his sleeve. you don't think he's going to let himself get hung without putting up a fight, do you? well i'll be it looks like we've been horn-swaggled and hoodwinked. let's go gather up the boys and shoot up this mangy town, craig. this mangy town's full of suckers pack, and they'll go for any deal they can get on cheap. come on we're going after the small investors. get in. is this kidnapping, you know that, don't you? shut up. i just won you in a raffle. suppose you're taking me to the united states marshall at center city. -why should i? -want to see me hang for killing your husband of course? i forgot to tell you. before you killed him he deserted me and ran off with a, female pharaoh dealer from gila ben. i wouldn't want to see you hang just for killing him. if you forget i'm worth 5000 dollars at the end of the road. the border isn't far off. the other day you kissed me. i know you did it just for spike but, it shook me to my very foundations. i suddenly felt it crazy overwhelming, impulse to give you the entire contents of my suitcase. how'd it make you feel? come to think of it. there does seem to be some kind of, haunting memory attached to the episode. maybe i better refresh my memory. this here's tony lorca, marshall. now he was here until last night when he just disappeared. that's tony lorca all right. for wherever he is he must be in a remarkable state of decomposition. considering the fact he's been dead more than a year. dead? -then who...? -oh, that other man. that was tony's brother, pepe. he looks like tony. but pepe's not a man of crime of violence he's he's more of a con man. i knew he was some kind of crook. you going to arrest him? no. pepe's been making his living going around, hanging up his brother's wanted posters and post offices. then he waits for human greed to set in. as far as i know there's nothing illegal about that. he he wrote zach martin out of 900 dollars. ain't that illegal? zach got his money back made a profit on the deal. yeah, so did all the others including that, syndicate from o'leary's laps where they more than come out even on the raffle. well somebody must have lost. sure that's it. what did shasta cooney get for her money? shasta cooney only invested in the price of a lottery ticket. and shasta got peppy look. this way. i have your room all ready for you. i see he's got her suitcase. he sure enough has. now don't tell me that ain't illegal. i married them last night. thus ends the saga of the whistling kid. i'm afraid he no longer does much whistling, but he's no kid anymore either. i shall return, after we hear about a product which my sponsor feels is the most wanted. i have just been reading some of the shocking things. they have written about me. age, weight, i assure you i'm not guilty. why don't you tune in next week and see if i beat this rap. until then good night."
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"my grandmother, livia, could certainly be patient. nine years passed before agrippa's services could be spared. then he died - poisoned by livia. tiberius divorced his wife and married julia. oh, yes, my grandmother always got her way in the end. wicked woman. you're getting soft. you wouldn't last a five-hour march in the army. throw it! oh, come on! throw it! antonia throws harder than that. shut up! throw the ball if you lost some of that stomach of yours... now we'll sea who's hard. - death or surrender? - oh, get off. ha! i never thought i'd sea you in such a condition. spend ten years in rome and sea how you feel hay... what's this, eh? sulks? you're lucky. you go back to the army tomorrow. that's the only decent life for a roman. marching, fighting, building forts. those were the best years of my life. you made the army's life bloody hell i drilled them hard, but i was fair. i'll boot they say i was fair. - do you know what they really say? - what? they say that your drills were bloodless battles... and your battles were bloody drills. - is that what they say? really? - yes. you know, that army i took across the alps, they were men. - you've never had men like that. - we've won some victories too. i know, i know. but those two legions... the twelfth and the sixteenth? you'll never sea their like again. nothing bothered them - the heat, the cold... the marching. oh, i cursed them and i flogged them, but i cursed and flogged their officers too. if there weren't any tents for the men, i slept out in the open with them. you'll have to take the field again. - he won't let me. - who, augustus? he keeps me here as his work donkey. says he can't spare me. i'm his chief errand boy. i spend my time investigating the level of unemployment. or reorganising the city fire brigade. added to that, there's that bitch julia they made me marry. oh, he's just impossible. sometimes he doesn't speak to me for days. he was always very broody, according to drusus, even as a child. drusus can always make him laugh. drusus only knows him as a brother. he ought to be married to him. you know, antonia, i'm very easygoing. do you want that toe to drop off? ! there's a stiffness in the joint. there wasn't before you started to work on it. they daydream. theyll spend all day massaging a toe if you let them. - she's probably in love. - i hope she has better luck than me. - what was i talking about? - about tiberius. he never wanted to divorce vipsania. that stalk of a thing? i don't know what he saw in her. she's as thin as a stick. he used to spend half of every night in bed looking for her! - julia! - it's true. if the sheets got a bit crumpled, she disappeared until morning. he was lucky if they found her when they made the bed. - she's not that thin! - i don't know what you call thin, but i saw old valerius after he starved himself to death and he looks better than she looks! i could never sea the attraction. after ten years, i'd have thought he'd be glad to sea the back of her. that's the trouble. he was always glad to sea the back of her. - julia, what on earth do you mean? - well. he's very strange. you're too sensitive a person for me to go into details. julia, he doesn't...? oh, i could put up with that. i'm not like you. i could probably teach him a thing or two. but it's the coldness. i can't get near him. even snow will melt on a warm day, but not him. - i had no idea. - and he hates gaius and lucius. - he hates my boys. theyre sweet. - very sweet. and to think i was once mad about him. what fools we women are. augustus should never have insisted on the marriage. don't blame my father. blame livia. if anyone insisted, she did. she tried the same thing ten years ago, but agrippa got in first. - i didn't know that. - no. you were too young. that's all right. i've had enough. when marcellus died, she had everything planned. she knew how i felt about tiberius and she wanted us to marry, but agrippa had the same idea, and augustus needed him more than he needed her son, so she had to wait. and can she wait! ye gods, time means nothing to her! - poor marcellus. - that must have been terrible. to tell you the truth... leave us. i'll call you. off you go. go. to tell you the truth, it's crossed my mind that livia might have had a hand in that. julia! i might be wrong, but he was a strong, healthy man, and he never had a serious illness until she got her hands on him. i often wonder about that woman. antonia, you're so innocent! hah! not so innocent. ask drusus. i might just do that one of these days if i get him in the mood! he's very attractive. why is it that when i come in here with you, i cover myself up, but normally i don't bother? well. you should. i don't approve of all this nakedness. oh, antonia! i shall miss you when you leave tomorrow. not so hard. the dirt's ingrained in the skin. - it goes deeper than that. - your gloom is magnificent. not so hard or i'll get my men to do it. i can't think why you won't let them anyway. a man should keep himself clean, not have slaves do it. how's he supposed to scrape his own back? - he gets his brother to do it. - if he hasn't a brother? - gets his son. - if he hasn't a son? - gets his friend. - if he hasn't a friend? then he should go and hang himself. i've tried it. it's better to have a slave scrape your back. you know, i shall miss you. - you don't have any dark thoughts. - nonsense. we all have them. not like me. not like me. you're no worse than the rest of us. i'll tell you something, drusus. sometimes i so hate myself, i can't bear the thought of me anymore. you don't know anything about darkness, do you? inside darkness. blackness. stop bragging! i could match you black for black. not you. not you. the claudian tree produces two kinds of apples - the sweet and the sour. that was never more true than you and me. and what of our mother, which is she? - livia? - mmm. they say a snake bit her once and died. hay, that's no longer funny. i've only cared for three people in my life. - one was our father. - the noblest of us all yes. the other was vipsania. yes. i was sorry about that. why did you divorce her? livia insisted on it. julia wanted it. augustus insisted on it. all the same, you were so happy, you might have refused. do you think the monarchy will survive augustus? no, i don't. rome will be a republic again, i promise you that. then perhaps i did it all for nothing. is that why you did it? is that really? but there are julia's sons. theyll come before you anyway. my poor brother. - so ambitious. - our mother makes me so. oh, god, i miss her so! vipsania. what did they make me do? tiberius. what's done is done. yes. yes, it's done. i must forget her. vipsania was the second and she's gone. you're the third. well. you know i feel the same way. you should have my nature and i yours. - why? - i'm older. i should protect you. well. we'll protect each other. i don't know what from. there are many things you don't know. - if anything happens to you... - what could happen? you could be killed in battle. - or you could fall sick and die. - yes. and you could cut your throat shaving or choke on a plum stone. tiberius, none of us is guaranteed a time. no. you're my lifeline into the light. six again! one, two, three, four, five, six now what will you do? i'll put two legions in the port and stop the corn supply. not bad. rome can't live without corn. you've got your back to the sea and that's not good. it's your decision. lucius, your turn. - six! - these dice have nothing but sixes. one, two, three, four, five, six belgica, belgic's mine. go on, throw again. two. - one, two. i'll take britain. - you've only got three legions. - julius did it. - he didn't stay long though. yes, what is it? caesar, your stepson drusus nero begs to take his leave. - yes, you can come with me. - can't we finish the game? later. we have a duty and duty comes before pleasure. come and say goodbye to the man who commands all our armies in germany. come on, come on. no sulks. that's not the roman way. - so you're leaving us? - yes, caesar. and glad to go? i go where i'm sent, caesar, but, yes, i am glad to go. when i was your age, i wanted to be with the army too. i brought gaius and lucius to say goodbye. we've been playing empire. i've already lost egypt and syria. - may i ask drusus a question? - go ahead. how many legions could invade britain? four. yes. and a great deal of auxiliary cavalry as well not three? theyre very uncivilised. it's not worth the risk. on a fresh venture, you must hit hard and quickly. sending for reinforcements gives the enemy breathing space. i'll do it one day. i doubt it's worth it. there's nothing of value there and the people make poor slaves. say goodbye and wait for me upstairs. - goodbye, then. - goodbye. goodbye. read julius' commentaries on his campaign in britain. - i've read it twice. - so have i. goodbye. don't move the tokens while i'm gone. i know where they are. theyre good boys. we'll have need of them one day. come and walk with me in the garden a moment. - is antonia travelling with you? - yes. - that's all right in her condition? - yes. i didn't realise she was expecting again. julia told me. - it's a bit close to the others. - well. what can you do? true. anyway, we need more children, especially among the nobility. people aren't getting married early enough. i must do something about that. have you said goodbye to livia? she's with the parthian ambassador. oh, yes. she works so hard for me. your mother is a very fine woman. i'd have given up long ago if it weren't for her. it's an immense burden to place on the shoulders of one man. yes, it is. it's really too much. i sometimes have a longing to be just a private citizen again. it's been 20 years now since mark antony died and i took it all on my own. i blame him, you know. what a fool that man was. the whole of the eastern empire was his. if he'd been a proper husband to my sister, things would be different. - is it too late...? - yes? is it too late to lay down the burdens of office? - and let the senate rule? - yes. you're just like your father. always wanting the republic. he was my enemy too at one time. i'll never be that. no. no, i didn't mean that. be like him, you couldn't do better. i did him wrong once, you know. oh, yes, yes. i took your mother from him and that has weighed with me over the years. still. we're a family, and we all work together for the greater good of rome. my brother... yes, yes, tiberius. he's a puzzle to me, like the sphinx he's like a large dog watching everything and saying nothing. - he wants to leave rome. - i know. but i need him here. what would i do without him? - still. an unwilling horse... - is more trouble than walking. but we're not horses. we can't all do what we want. and what does he want? he wants to sit on a rock all day - rhodes or capri - and throw stones at the sea. why? i don't know. no. we can't have it. ah, here's your mother. - you're off again? - yes, mother. you read the dispatches? the corusci are giving trouble again. i'll give them trouble enough. shall we aver civilise the germans? - i doubt it. - you know how i feel when we conquer a people, we must be temperate, but when agreements are broken, punishments must be severe. what do the parthians want? they want a roman god to worship. they want to dedicate a temple to you. i won't have it. we've abolished kings in rome. would you give us living gods? they won't be in rome. theyll be in syria. what harm is a temple built in your name where primitive people...? no, it makes me uneasy, livia. i feel in my heart it's not right. we may offend those gods that look after us and oversee our destiny. - but... - no. you must tell them no. i must get back to the boys and finish the game. look after antonia. no accidents. who knows what great roman she may be carrying. the gods go with you. i shall ask the boys to dine with us. they can listen to the discussion with the ambassadors. leave him alone. don't encourage him to step down from office. mother, do you really want us to drift into a hereditary monarchy? become corrupt like the eastern potentates? rome will never be a republic again. well. we needn't quarrel about it. let me kiss you and say goodbye. you know, you mustn't mind if you dislike me. a mother can't love all her children. you shouldn't have come here. it's wrong. it's wrong. don't send me away. please, vipsania. do you want to make trouble for me? no. no. then go away. it's dangerous. open the shutter. let me look at you again. please, please go away! is it true? yes. yes, it's true. - you're getting married again. - yes. i won't have it. i won't have it! i'll kill you! you're mine! you're my wife! i am not your wife. you divorced me. don't... don't. please, you must leave me alone. we mustn't sea each other again. - do you love him? - do you love her? no. no, i hate her. - he's very kind to me. - but why must you marry again? i must put an end to your following me! to your coming to sea me! your mother's spies are everywhere. i don't care about that! you're married to augustus' daughter. you can't treat her like no one. don't get married again, i beg you. i couldn't bear it. and spend the rest of my life alone? you wouldn't be alone, i promise you. tiberius, it was not my doing. i didn't divorce you, you divorced me! i didn't want to. - they made me do it. - they couldn't have made me! i'm sorry. i didn't mean that. i didn't mean that. it was hard for you, i know. harder for you than it would have been for me. i shouldn't have done it. i should have killed myself first. it's done now. there's no going back. let's die together. let's kill ourselves. let's go into our bathroom, open our veins, and when they find us, our blood will be mingling in the water. oh, my baby, my baby. it's too late. it's too late. i'm lost. i'm lost. i go from darkness into darkness. you'll come through it and so will i. how will i? i'm afraid of what i'll become without you. - why should you be afraid? - because of your sweetness. we had a delegation here six months ago from palmyra. and augustus refused, i remember. the thought of deification makes him uneasy. it might make us all uneasy. - we're not all worthy of it. - no, of course. but his mind is made up? yes, but so is mine. i cannot allow his natural modesty to interfere with his political judgement. if the senate thought that his deification were politically useful. he would not be displeased. but he will exert no pressure nor be present at the debates. of course. there will be some opposition. - but i'll take the line... - i'll tell you what line to take. you were sea! and in broad daylight! going in and coming out. i won't have it! it's not the first time! i went to congratulate her. don't congratulate her! leave her be! you didn't go for that reason! you'll treat my daughter with respect! do you hear me?! i didn't ask for this marriage, you asked for it! i won't have it made a mockery of! he's been seeing his former wife, if you please! - i think you exaggerate. - i exaggerate nothing! he met her on the street. yes, you did. i heard about it. i hear everything. nothing escapes me. he didn't dare speak to her, but he followed her like a moonstruck calf for everyone to sea! you will not make a laughing stock of my family or as quick as boiled asparagus, i'll have you out! out! you listen to me. mark antony was twice the man you are, but when he spat on my sister, he learned a lesson he didn't live long enough to profit from. julia and i don't get on. damn you! you'll get on whether you like it or not! and you'll leave that woman alone! let me go away. let me leave rome. what am i to do with him? tell me. you're his mother, speak to him. it's agrippa all over again. he doesn't mean it. he doesn't want to go. didn't you hear what he said?! he's unhappy. he didn't mean it. it's not unnatural for a man to sea his former wife now and then. i saw his father several times after you and i were married. - that was different. - not so different. and you saw julia's mother from time to time. - yes, but not in secret! - i don't remember being present. maybe not, but it was not in secret! well. how secret was this? i knew about it. - you knew about it? - of course. he told me. you never said anything to me. have you so little to occupy your time that i must tell you about everyone in the household? you're always complaining that you have too much to think about. perhaps you'd care to sea the laundry lists in future? all right. i was hasty. but you understand i felt i had cause! tiberius, listen. i'm not blind. i know that you and julia aren't the most perfectly-matched couple, but what can you do? these things happen. we can't cut the knot every time we quarrel especially us. we have to set an example. livia, you'll back me. of course. we have duties which far outweigh our private feelings. exactly. now, tiberius, you play fair with me, eh? don't sulk. if it's a little thing on the side - i'm not encouraging - who's to know? forgetting that your mother's here - if that's aver possible! yes. well. we can wink at it between men. but vipsania... i don't like it, do you understand? it's not right. you play fair with me and you'll sea i can be generous too. good. good. if there's one thing i hate, it's a family row. what does it cost to be kind? to be sympathetic and understanding. yes? a messenger has arrived from germany, caesar. send him in. a dispatch from drusus nero for his noble brother. tiberius, let's hear what he says. ""my dear tiberius, a period of enforced rest due to a slight head wound ""has given me much time to reflect on the state of our beloved rome."" - he's wounded. not seriously? - he says slight. ""such was the extent of the corruption that i found in..."" go on. the handwriting is... surely you can read more than that? yes. well. he goes on to say err... well? honestly, sir, it's not worth reading. i think my brother was perhaps not himself when he wrote it. ""..the corruption and petty place seeking that i found in rome. ""i have come to the conclusion that it is the consequence ""of the continued exercise of supreme power by augustus. ""could we not persuade him, even compel him to retire? ""i firmly believe he is ready to do this, ""but for the stubbornness of our mother livia, ""who derives such satisfaction ""from the exercise of supreme power through him..."" there's more. do you want to read it? the letter's clearly treasonable. no, no. he feels strongly about it. i understand that. he's wrong, but i understand it. then again, perhaps he's right. perhaps i should retire. i've said so often enough. will you allow him to insult me? he's your son, not mine! his wound might have affected him. he speaks of giddiness at the end. yes. yes. that's it. he's a little bit deranged. those german forests can affect a man. i'll call him back for a rest. it'll be good to sea him again. yes, you're right. we should have him back. i'll send a doctor with the letter. - he's got a doctor. - army doctors! what do they know? i'll send my own. he'll know how to take care of him. easy. that's right. fetch the doctor. - which one? - ours, of course, and hurry. lift him onto the table and be careful or i'll make eunuchs of you! you blockheads! right. get this away. i'll have the lot of you crucified. it's all right. it's all right. all right. clear out. it feels terrible. it's a mess. we'll get it cleaned. hurry up with that water! what happened? my horse fell on me. i couldn't get out. it crushed my leg on a rock, then tore it to shreds getting up. - the doctor's coming. - what did they mean - ""which one""? one arrived from rome. he's your mother's personal physician. that was kind of her. he'll have more to look at. where is he? we found him a room. he doesn't look too happy. he's already missing the comforts of home. this will probably hurt. he brought a letter with him from caesar. - where is it? - i'll give it to you after. give it to me now! rufus? - what happened? - a horse fell and crushed his leg. - oh... - no, no, i'm all right. i've been invited, politely, back to rome. - why? - i'm not sure, but i can guess. oh! get out of here! you'll not be moving far on that leg, if i'm any judge of wounds. i don't understand it. a simple fall - how could it happen? - they can be bad sometimes. - to bring him to death's door. - it's an excuse for not returning. why do you say that? i've heard such reasons before. don't raise your voice to me. - what reason could he have? - who knows? we know he has the whole of the western armies at his back. he'll come when it suits him. i must go to my brother. he's 500 miles away. he could be dead even now. all the same, i must go to him. i'll make a sacrifice and offer prayers. perhaps he won't be taken from us. take him our love. well. go, go quickly! the senate today voted to make me a god in palmyra. theyll put a little statue to me in the temple and people will bring offerings asking me to bring rain or cure their father's gout. tell me, livia, if i'm a god - even in palmyra... how do i cure gout? what is it, my love? what do you want? fetch the children. yes. yes, of course. i'll bring them. he wants me to fetch the children. - is he...? - no. but it's near. - what is it? - gangrene. it crept slowly up. nothing seemed to stop it. where's the staff surgeon? he wasn't allowed near him. he took the case out of his hands. musar. it was just a simple fall what happened to your skill? i...i came too late. his condition was too far gone. i came too late. drusus? drusus, look at me. drusus, it's i, tiberius. you and your damned plum stones. she read the letter. i couldn't stop her. she was there when i got it. i couldn't think it would have anything in it. rome has a severe mother. and gaius and lucius... a cruel stepmother. drusus...? drusus...? drusus! no. no. (baby cries) you didn't wait. you didn't wait. look. i brought you little claudius. and you didn't wait. shouldn't have died and that's a fact somebody blundered, and that's a fact (knocking) come. your meal is ready, caesar. will you have it now or shall i take it away? very good. i think the cook's on form today, for a change. try that. there. the garlic's overdone for my taste. you're always complaining about the g-garlic. go on. a good swallow now. yes, i know this one. it's from the north. about five years old. they had a bad summer. the grapes had less sugar in them. oh, stop showing off. well. fill it up, then you can go. i'm very busy. - another history, caesar? - yes. - of the etruscans again? - no, of my family. did you aver read my history of the etruscans? no. i got it down from the library once, but i couldn't get into it. very well written, of course. very well is something the matter, caesar? the fact is, when you know that someone's trying to poison you, nothing tastes right, absolutely nothing. come now, who would want to poison you, caesar? don't butter me up! you know who'd want to poison me. my wife, that's who, and that slimy son of hers. for all i know, you're in league with them. in my opinion, the only person likely to poison us is the cook. i wish you'd let me get rid of him. he's a greek and the only thing he does is stuff vine leaves. will you take it away? i'm not hungry. may i ask how the current work is coming? well enough. may i ask how far you've got? the death of my father. ah, the noble drusus. a tragedy that one should lose one's father so young. - yes! - yes. a tragedy for us all yes, and for rome. and especially for my uncle. he was never the same again. (melancholy pipe plays) well. sons of agrippa... the daylight's fled and stars are out. it's time for decent people to lock their doors and go to sleep. come. come on. you can sea me to my bed... and then go to your own. yes, we've eaten well and drunk well too well perhaps. poor julia. she can't take the wine as she used to. and even dear antonia nods a little. what...? what were you thinking tonight, my dear? ah, of poor drusus. yes, yes, i was thinking of him tonight too. rome cannot afford such a loss. i pray to the gods that these boys will be as noble and virtuous as he was. you mustn't dwell on it. a year has gone by. that's quite long enough for grief. more is not the roman way, you know. musicians, play us out. let us have music to take us to our sleep. a year? is that all it is? one little year? goodnight, lady. (julia snores) pretty sight, isn't she? i must get away from her. i must leave rome. you'll stay. you'll have patience, as i have. where has your patience got you? you've lost him, mother. you've lost him to those two boys. if you leave rome, i'll wash my hands of you once and for all and shed not a single tear. that's not surprising. i saw you shed none for my brother. have they all gone? oh, tiberius, i was having such a beautiful dream. tiberius... sleep with me tonight. i'll be so loving to you. be nice to me. oh, just tonight. let me go, you fat drunken cow! fat? ! fat? ! i'm fat where a woman should be fat, not skinny like a boy! go to bed, my dear, and i'll send you one up. he's very pretty, i promise you. i've had him myself. he reminds me of your ex-wife. not a hair on his body and his even skinnier behind! there'll be no divorce. none! i don't care what he is. you married him. look what your son did to my daughter. what kind of a man is that? i've never liked him, never. he's your son, but i've never liked him. - i want a divorce! - no divorce! you've been married three times already! that's not my fault! i was widowed twice! how can a woman get herself widowed twice? - that's not fair! - it shows damn poor judgment! i never asked to marry agrippa! well. you asked to marry this one! that husband of yours can clear out of rome. tell him to go. i don't even want to sea him. i don't want his name mentioned in this house! how am i supposed to live, neither married nor divorced? you'll live as befits a roman matron. and heaven help you if you don't! oh, i don't know. why can't they get on? what do they want from life? i'm supposed to rule an empire and i can't rule my own family. thank god for these boys. you'll help me, won't you? what would we do without agrippa's sons, livia? theyre our one hope. in three or four years, theyll be able to take some of this burden. theyre promising, all right. aren't you, my beauties? very promising. still. you've a long way to go, haven't you? a long, long way. we must take good care of them, augustus. and we shall. i promise you. the very best of care. ah, that's how it should be. stay like that a moment. what a picture you make. it expresses the true spirit of the roman family."
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"i don't want any trouble here, barclay. why would there be trouble? wherever you go, trouble follows. - lt barclay, you're on duty. - is that a fact? it is and you'll observe it. so get back to your post. look, pal, why don't you do me a favour? take your holier-than-thou attitude and get out of my life. this is insubordination, mr. barclay. here's to insubordination. riker, you're nothing but a pretty mannequin in a fancy uniform. you're full of hot air. picard has a problem with me, you tell him to come and talk to me himself. i feel your confidence, your arrogant resolve. it excites me. lt barclay, report to cargo bay five now. it'll have to wait till later, darling. i'll be right there! save program. i don't know what to do with him. he's always late. he never gives his best effort, just slides by. i can't deal with it. how did he make it through the academy? it's time we spoke to the captain about broccoli. - that's what wesley calls him. - it fits. commander, a broken seal. better destroy it. the samples will be tainted. is it a problem for you to report to duty on time? no, sir. i'm very sorry, sir. i had a very important communiqué, which required my response. i don't want to hear it. we have a problem with this antigrav unit. see what you can do. mr. barclay, i'm tired of seeing your name on report. i don't know about your last posting, but on the enterprise, we set a different standard. - understood? - understood, sir. space, the final frontier. these are the voyages of the starship enterprise. its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. captain's log, star date 43807.4. we're taking tissue samples donated by the mikulaks for shipment to nahmi iv, where they may help to contain an outbreak of correllium fever. everything looks normal to me. computer, activate antigrav unit. damn it! i don't understand. engineering, i need more people in cargo bay five. la forge out. we could use a hand, mr. barclay. i'll disassemble it later, commander. it shouldn't do that. well, i mean, of course it shouldn't do that. it shouldn't do that. i'm not accustomed to seeing an unsatisfactory rating like this. the question is if mr. barclay is enterprise material. so, you've requested that he be transferred? i hate to say it, but i always thought i could work with anybody. but broccoli makes me nervous. he makes everybody nervous. - broccoli? - young mr. crusher started that. - i guess it's caught on. - let's get that uncaught. indications are that he served competently in starfleet for years. his ratings on the zhukov were satisfactory. i recall capt gleason speaking highly of him before his transfer. i wonder if capt gleason wasn't buttering our bread. he knew that we needed an engineer. barclay's psychological profile shows a history of seclusive tendencies. it was noted at the academy. yet he has made the same commitment to starfleet that we all have. it's easy to transfer a problem to someone else. too easy. captain, i have tried. try harder, geordi. he's a member of your team. try to find a way to help him make a positive contribution. get to know the man better. make him your best friend. with all due respect, my best friend? i can barely tolerate being in a room with him. i suggest you put your personal discomfort on one side. - dismissed. - yes, sir. reg? how's it going? it's... i still haven't traced the problem, commander. - it's alright. no problem. - i'm going to run diagnostics on the graviton inverter's circuits. smart plan. i'd say we're in good hands. - i'll give you a report... - whenever. ..before the end of the day. fine. fine. how about sitting in on the mission briefing in the morning? - me? - i'd like your input. what on? do you want me to prepare a...? no, no. just be there. - 0800 hours. - i'll be on time, sir. good. good. carry on. morning. start your brains, gentlemen, and let's do it. - anybody seen lt barclay? - not yet, sir. ok. ok. this trip to nahmi iv is pretty routine, so we'll have time to realign the capacitors on both injectors. duffy, costa, that'll be your assignment. we can do the flow-regulator maintenance at the same time. good idea. ensign crusher will be training with us this week. i'll assign him to you, mr. myers. be sure and teach him the difference between impulse and warp drive. lt barclay has been working on the mystery of the antigrav failure. your preliminary report had some interesting theories. why don't you bring us up to speed on your findings? yes. it wasn't a maintenance problem. everything checked out. i'll look for a surge in the transfer coils. a coil surge wouldn't cause field dissipation. - i realize that. - don't ignore possibilities, wes. check the flow capacitor. that could have affected the antigrav field. i was going to. good. ok, let's take a look at that realignment procedure. i just didn't know what to say. what do you wish you had said? i should've told him to mind his own damn business! i knew about the flux capacitor. i didn't need to hear about it from a 1 7-year-old kid. you're letting this get you much too upset. you think so? why are you so hard on yourself? you don't know. - it's hard out there. - i understand. but let go of it. you're here now. you're right, of course. of course. - let me help you relax. - i'd like that. i knew you would. that's nice. but i'm in the mood for someplace a little more unusual. computer, run barclay program 1 5. i am the goddess of empathy. cast off your inhibitions and embrace love, truth, joy... we should discuss different approaches. you didn't do anything wrong. it's just that barclay's my new project. broccoli's a real project! i need to draw him out. and i shut him down. poor broccoli. pardon me, but why is he being referred to as a vegetable? it's a joke, data. you know, a nickname? nicknames generally denote fondness, a diminutive shared between friends. data's right. the nickname stops here and now. captain's orders. - what the hell? - what happened to your glass? nucleosynthesis. the glass has been altered at the atomic level. - problem with the replicator? - unlikely. that would have affected the contents as well as the glass. the liquid was a synthehol replication of a light ale of earth origin, which is what lt duffy ordered. i can't detect anything unusual that would have caused this. the glass probably had contact with an unshielded power source. that means a complete check of the power systems. all 4,000 of them. do i have the perfect man for the job. reg! are you busy? i was just... no, not really. why? i've got another mystery for you. somehow the molecular structure of this cup has been altered. we need to check the power systems to see if a leak caused this. - i had... i was going to do that. - you were? yes. to try to explain the antigrav unit failure. i still can't. nothing about it makes sense. it's possible that these two incidents are related. this is minor, but it may be a symptom of a more serious problem. should we go to a star base? lt barclay will check the power systems. lt barclay suggested a link between the two incidents. no, it wasn't... not really. will your investigation affect our available power? no. no, sir. we'll have to shut off some systems. we'll shut them down a few at a time. it shouldn't... i don't think so. good. i'll look forward to your report, mr. broccoli. barclay. if you'll excuse me. metathesis is one of the most common of pronunciation errors. a reversal of vowel and consonant. barc to broc... yes, i know him. he comes in, stands at the bar, doesn't say much. - he orders a warm milk. - figures! helps you sleep. you should try it. what's this to do with barclay? i'm just trying to figure the man out. do you ever talk to him? - he doesn't talk much. - does he have any friends? not that i've seen. what do you do with a guy like that? well, i just serve him warm milk and let him be. i'm not so lucky. i can't let him be. he's my problem. well, he's imaginative. - how do you know that? - i know. then maybe he's in the wrong job. you engineering types don't appreciate imagination? that's not it, guinan. he just doesn't fit in here. - terkim. - what? reminds me of terkim, my mother's brother. sort of the family misfit. everybody told me to stay away from him. bad influence. - and did you? - are you kidding? he was the only one of my family with a sense of humour. no one stayed around him long enough to realize it but me. my mother says i remind her of him. i probably do. the idea of fitting in just repels me. maybe i'm not making myself clear. barclay, well, he's always late. the man's nervous. nobody wants to be around him. if i felt nobody wanted to be around me, i'd probably be late and nervous. - guinan, that's not the point. - are you sure? excuse me. computer, where is lt barclay? reg! - beverly? - good morning, my lord. manners, my son. you embarrass me before our guest. master barclay will spank you if you misbehave. - wesley? - what do you want? i guess i want master barclay. the boys got into another scrap, i'm afraid. boys will be boys. you cannot withstand our assault forever, barclay. you are outnumbered. - say you will yield. - i shall speak with my sword. where did you learn to fight like this? self-taught, my capitaine. shall i give you a few lessons? - who is that? one of your allies? - jean-luc! not that old trick. i'm very disappointed in you. i'll make it easy for you. i'll request a reassignment. - now, wait a minute. - look, the whole ship knows - i just can't cut it here. - barclay. i've spent time in the holodeck, too. what you do in the holodeck is your own business. as long as it doesn't interfere with your work. you're not going to tell anyone about this? i don't think everybody would appreciate your imagination like i do. it is kind of unusual, recreating people you already know. well, it was just... i needed to blow off some steam. one of the officers had been getting on my back. let me guess. it was you. and i just couldn't tell you what i wanted to tell you to your face, so it just sort of got out of control. there's a part of this that's kinda therapeutic. you could talk to counsellor troi about it. when i'm in there, i'm just more comfortable. you don't know what a struggle this has been for me. i'd like to help, if i can. being afraid all the time of forgetting somebody's name, not knowing what to do with your hands. i mean, i am the guy who writes down things to remember to say at a party. and then, when he gets there, winds up alone in the corner, trying to look comfortable examining a potted plant. - you're just shy, barclay. - just shy. sounds like nothing serious, doesn't it? you can't know. - o'brien to la forge. - go ahead. i need you in transporter room three. on my way, chief. listen, reg, i really do want you to talk to counsellor troi. - troi? no. i couldn't. - i mean it. as your friend and as your commanding officer. i was synchronizing the phase-transition coils, like i've done a hundred times before. the test object is pure duranium. - seems normal. - watch this. glad i don't have anywhere to go. chief engineer's log, star date 43808.2. analysis of transporter room three reveals no cause for the latest malfunction. - this part of the same pattern? - we don't know. none of the other transporter rooms are malfunctioning. yet. we reach nahmi iv in 22 hours. i want all transporters operational. i want a level-one diagnostic across the board. have mr. barclay join us on the bridge immediately. make it 1 400 hours. i've got him working on something. 1 400 hours. mr. o'brien, no maintenance until further notice. aye, sir. i know this is difficult for you. is there anything i can do to make you more comfortable? no. have you been with a counsellor before? - yes... no. - which one? yes. but she... it wasn't... it wasn't really a counsellor. most people find a counsellor intimidating at first. it's ok if you feel that way toward me. - not at all. - good. now, lean back, close your eyes. why? i want to make you more comfortable. - you do? - yes. it's ok. close your eyes. what are you going to do? just listen to the sound of my voice. take a slow deep breath in through your nose... ..and let it out through your mouth just as slowly. that's better, isn't it? much better. oh, yes. yes, that's much better. that is extremely helpful. - thank you for your time. - but... in through the nose, out through the mouth. i'm going to practise that and i'll let you know. thank you. i had a very strange visit from one of your officers today. barclay? yeah, i can imagine. were you able to help him? to be honest, i'm not sure what happened. where's mr. barclay? it's past 1 400 hours. lt barclay, report to the bridge. lt barclay, report! computer, locate lt barclay. lt barclay is in holodeck two. - i'll get him. - no, i'll handle this. - i've had it with him. - counsellor, you'd better come. barclay's been running some unique programs. i don't care what he's been running. i just ran out of patience. like i said, barclay's been running some unusual programs. crew members should not be simulated in the holodeck. - there's no regulation against... - well, there ought to be. - computer, discontinue and erase. - belay that order. counsellor? if barclay is having difficulty facing reality, to suddenly destroy his only means of escape would be brutal and could do considerable damage. they are quite disagreeable, aren't they? - shall we have at them? - delighted. - we shall thrash them. - en garde! stop it. put that down. your sword, sir. i don't have a sword. how do you expect to fight without your sword? i don't expect to fight. do i detect a streak of yellow along the good fellow's back? perhaps we should supply a more appropriate adversary. number one! - number one! - here i come. am i late? did i miss the fight? en garde! you, sir, have a familiar bearing. have we crossed swords before? where is he? where's barclay? a personal grudge. i warn you, put your affairs in order before you meet him in combat. you challenge the greatest sword... in all the holodeck. you think this is funny? you are very tall. it might seem threatening. mr. barclay will learn how threatening. computer, discontinue image of riker. sir! you have no sense of fair play. tell us where to find barclay. you want us to search for him? it could give us information about what's troubling him. a healthy fantasy is fine as long as it doesn't take over. you call this healthy? you're taking it so seriously. it's not without humour. i am the goddess of empathy. cast off your inhibitions, and embrace love, truth, joy... oh, my god! discard your facades, and reveal your true being to me. - computer, discontinue... - computer, belay that order. we want to see what's troubling this poor man, remember? quite a healthy fantasy life, wouldn't you say? - report. - velocity increased to warp 7.25. - compensating, sir. - confirmed. velocity now warp seven. maintain that. what the hell happened? the matter/antimatter injectors locked for a split second. i do not know why. they are working normally now. - picard to la forge. - go ahead. what's this injector problem? - well, sir, i'm in holodeck two. - another malfunction? not exactly. i'll return to engineering immediately. i think you should. your holodeck activities can wait until later. and, commander? consult lt barclay on this latest incident. i'd like to very much. la forge out. we need to find barclay now. cast aside your masks and let me slip into your minds. muzzle it. we have a lot to talk about, mr. barclay. barclay and i had better get to engineering. dismissed. i couldn't keep my eyes open. i'd worked 1 2 hours on the power systems and then the transporter went down. you had a chance to get help from the real troi. - instead, you went back in there. - i couldn't help myself. you could write a book on holodiction. i know how easy it is to get caught up in it. - i fell in love in there. - really? but i knew when it was time to turn it off and say goodbye. the people that i create in there are more real to me than anyone i meet out here, except maybe you, commander. i need you out here, reg. now more than ever. the injectors aren't responding to commands. i think we should drop out of warp. la forge to bridge. go ahead. - recommend we go to impulse power. - take us out of warp. controls are not responding. - it's the injectors. - override. it's not a computer problem. the mechanism is physically jammed. i can't clear it. speed increasing, sir. warp 7.6, 7.65. warp 7.7. we can't shut it down, captain. antimatter flow is increasing. she's accelerating out of control. there is nothing i can do. - approaching warp nine, sir. - red alert. estimated time to structural failure? at this rate, 1 5 minutes, 40 seconds, sir. copy that, geordi? recommendations? i'll let you know as soon as we have some. this ship will tear itself apart in 1 5 minutes. i want ideas, no matter how outrageous. how about a magnetic quench? no. the magnetic fields won't reset. are the fuel-inlet servos caught in cycle? no, the swirl dampers would be frozen. nothing showed up in the diagnostic? the tests showed prob... i mean, there were no problems with the fl... there's nothing wrong with computer protocols or power systems. the injectors are just physically jammed! injectors freeze, an antigrav unit and a transporter malfunction... and a twisted glass. what's the connection? exceeding warp 9.4. begin evacuation of secondary hull. prepare for emergency saucer separation. standing by to release docking clamps. reroute power to primary hull. the plasma flow is uneven due to injector lock. a saucer separation could rupture the warp field. 1 2 minutes to structural failure. none of the systems involved are connected. what if one of us is the connection? - us? how? - i don't know. but we're looking for a systemic explanation and there isn't one. we work with all the affected systems. what if we're transmitting something ourselves by touching it or something? the computer would pick that up. but if it was something that we couldn't scan, you might have passed it on to the injectors. it was your glass, duffy. you were both there when the antigrav failed. so was o'brien. the transporter malfunction is a connection. danger. approaching safety limits. computer, list all substances that would evade a scan. there are 15,525 known substances that cannot be detected by scans. how many of those can exist in oxygen? 532. and could alter molecular structure when in contact with glass? five. on screen at this station! duffy. jakmanite has a half-life of 1 5 seconds. no time to spread it. right. selgninaem and lucovexitrin are highly toxic. that leaves saltzgadum and invidium, which haven't been used for decades. could either of them be the cause? most of the affected systems weren't even invented when they were in use. - wasn't invidium used in medicine? - a century ago. the mikulaks might still use it. - one of those canisters was broken. - la forge to bridge. we have a working theory. we picked up invidium from a broken canister and spread it around the ship. working theory? we need a working solution in five minutes. understood. we're checking cargo bay five. nothing on the tricorder. danger. exceeding safety limits of engine containment field. structural failure will occur in three minutes, 30 seconds. if it's in there, it should show up on one of the polarity channels. there it is. duffy and o'brien became contaminated. invidium at minus 200 degrees celsius becomes inert. la forge to bridge. invidium has been confirmed. recommend we flood the injector pathway conduit with cryonetrium. will the injectors come back on line? they sustained damage. i can't guarantee that we will regain control. - we don't have much choice, do we? - no, sir. make it so. route primary coupling through starboard conduit. routeing. ready for engine core injection. structural failure will occur in 45 seconds. injector conduit temperature, minus 1 00 degrees. - injector control to manual. - ready. temperature now minus 1 90 degrees. minus 200 degrees, sir. - injector status? - matter injector is on line. antimatter injector still locked. structural failure will occur in 30 seconds. cycle power through ventral relay. antimatter injector on line. reducing flow capacity. commencing warp engine shutdown, sir. - stand down from red alert. - nice work, geordi. - mr. barclay and i thank you, sir. - acknowledged. recommend we set a course for star base 121 for a complete systems- and bio-decontamination. understood. picard out. glad you were with us out here in the real world, mr. barclay. it has been most difficult to reach this decision to leave you. but after discussing it at length with counsellor troi, i think it's for the best. i just wanted to thank you all for your support. - you'll always be welcome here, reg. - i know. that's why it's so difficult to leave. it was a pleasure to serve with you, mr. barclay. good luck, reg. it's been fun. computer,... ..end program. erase all programs filed under reginald barclay. except program nine."

why, i don't think i remember, my dear. you're looking at that album again? it seems like that's all you do lately is look at that album. when was that picture taken? oh, it's a lovely picture of you, nelda. thank you, ma'am. let's see. that was taken the summer after dr. loren retired from the laboratory. you're holding those lovely yellow roses that jensen planted for us. you don't look any different now than you did then. that's kind of you, miss jana. jana, nelda will put that away for you. that's all right, father. i'd like to put it away myself. you're not chilly, are you, jana, dear? shouldn't be. 72 degrees in here. isn't it, william? isn't it 72 degrees? exactly. the optimum temperature. of course. the optimum temperature. and the fireplace- designed for perfect heat radiation. the chairs, for maximum comfort. and the windows for the most efficient light, and proper ventilation. oh, yes, and the ceilings for the most desirable acoustical qualities. everything built to perfection, father. everything designed for a perfect life. oh, please continue, nelda. that's it. haven't you had enough of that, mother? why, jana, dear you know it helps my appetite. almost 6:00. nearly time for dinner. why don't we eat a little bit earlier tonight? or a little bit later? why don't we go out to a restaurant? a restaurant? why, jana, my dear, why in the world would we go out to eat in a restaurant? i don't know. it's just that it would be different. yes, it would be different. we'd walk through the rain and get ourselves sopping wet. then we'd eat some greasy, unpalatable food served off of dirty, unwashed plates and after that it would be a moot question whether we'd succumb to ptomaine or pneumonia. will that be all, ma'am? oh, just a little bit longer, nelda. don't make her do that anymore! what is the matter with you? it's just that outside there must be the clean, beautiful sound of rain. and in here those constant animal grunts of pleasure. jana! yell at me, father. please yell at me. i can't tell you how delighted i am to hear you yell at me. it proves that you've got lungs. lungs and a mind and a mouth and a voice. oh, father, we're atrophying in here. we sit here day after day and year after year while that clock turns and turns. and we decay with every minute while nelda the maid and robert the butler and gretchen the cook and jensen the handyman... jana! while these domestics do everything but our breathing for us. nelda, will you leave us, please? yes, sir. nelda! i'm speaking to you, nelda. yes, miss jana? don't you agree with me, nelda? you were saying, miss jana? i was about to say that... i was about to make mention of the fact... please don't stop on my account, jana. we have no secrets here. don't we? no secrets. is that it, father? why, that's all we do have- secrets. that's how we live- by shutting off the world, turning our backs on it, while you soundless, fleshless things glide around here and, with your efficient ministrations, turn my father and my mother into jelly. if i may say so, miss jana, you sound jealous. you said yourself, jana, that i designed and built to perfection, and i made these people quite indestructible. it's like living with ghosts. oh, no, my dear. not ghosts. ghosts are those who have died after living, but these people had no life until i gave it to them. the residence of dr. william loren, which is, in reality, a menagerie for machines. we're about to discover that sometimes the product of man's talent and genius can walk amongst us untouched by the normal ravages of time. these are dr. loren's robots, built to function as well as artistic perfection. but, in a moment, dr. william loren, wife and daughter will discover that perfection is relative- that even robots have to be paid for- and very shortly will be shown exactly what is the bill. tonight, florient unscented, the new kind of room deodorant that kills bad odors yet leaves no fragrance, brings you... ah. i believe i'll take the meerschaum tonight, robert. i'll prepare it, sir. will there be anything else, dr. loren? i think not tonight, robert. good night, sir. good night, robert. oh, uh... robert? there's no need. i'll light your pipe tonight, father. well, jana, shall we talk of it now? shall we talk of what? why, i think that's quite obvious. suddenly, inexplicably, your mother and i find you're unhappy. you're rebellious. do you think that pleases us, jana? i don't know. i explained to you a long time ago why i did what i did- why i retired from the world, and why i built these people. what you've done to yourselves is an atrocity. but what you've done to me is worse. you've turned me into a freak- an unsocial, unworldly, insulated freak. shall i tell you what else i've done for you, jana? i've kept you from harm. i've protected you against disease. and insulation in this 20th century is no crime. it's a service. you've never had to look into the face of war or the face of poverty or prejudice. well, you've been isolated, yes, but what you think of as imprisonment just happens to be asylum and security, yes, and survival. asylum in a hothouse? security in a mausoleum? survival as a vegetable survives. what you're becoming, and what you're making me become... a vegetable. thank you. yes, sir. oh. now, madam. there's a good girl. will that be all, ma'am? yes. thank you, nelda. good night. good night, ma'am. nelda! time is running out, father. instead of controlling, you're being controlled. why, you're becoming dependent. you're both reaching a point where you won't be able to exist without them. destroy them, father. get rid of them. dismantle them. jana! jana, they're not just machines. do you know how many thousands of hours i've spent in developing them and perfecting them? do you realize how... how marvelously intricate they are? how scientifically precise? not just arms and legs that move, jana. they're creatures. they have minds and wills. they have memory tracks, you see? i've given each one of them a memory of his own, haven't i? yes. and all of them can recount to you in detail everything that's happened to them since their early childhood, and they had no childhood. they were born just as you see them now, weren't they? yes. looking the way they do, acting the way they do, but each with his own talent. one of them was built as a cook. another was built as a maid. the butler was manufactured as a butler. the handyman knows nothing but being a handyman. jana, you're not asking me to dismantle machines. you're asking me to destroy that which has life. life? they're just highly complicated toys. father, you've turned this house into a playroom. why, jana, dear. listen to your mother. you're acting like a willful child. a willful child? i'm acting like a woman, mother, who wants something more out of life than just to be massaged five times a day. or a man who thinks paradise is having his pipes filled and refilled, and his slippers put on and taken off. you've got to get rid of them, father- nelda, gretchen, suzanne- all of them. that is quite impossible. i'll give you a choice- get rid of them or i'll leave. you can't leave, jana, dear. why, you simply can't leave. well, what would happen to you? who'd look after you? what would you do out there? i'd be with normal people, mother- people who live and work and then die- but do it properly, the way god intended. that's where i want to be- out there! i want my freedom. jana, it just isn't possible. i want my freedom! miss jana, you'll forgive me but that was most intemperate of you. i consider that unforgivable behavior. jana, you must have respect for your parents. i agree. you must show respect. stop it! you're jokes. that's what you are. hysterical jokes, with your sad little homilies and your mouthed cliches. you're nothing but walking record players. that's all any of you are- walking record players. jana, you're making it difficult for me to be patient. very difficult indeed. i do apologize, father. i know how accustomed to perfection you are, and i hate to throw a stone in that serene pool of yours, but you forgot something. do you know that? you forgot something. they may be indestructible, father, but you're not! jana. jana, dear, you don't really want to leave us, do you? i thought i made it quite plain, father. i want you to open the windows and let the air in. i want you to let the world in. by destroying my whole life's work. jana, we've loved you very much. if you could only see that all of this has been just as much for you as for ourselves. oh, jana, we love you more than words can tell. i know that, father. i know that. then... then you will stay. oh, please stay, jana. i beg of you, please. no. jana, i'll do what you asked me to do. i promise you. i'll do it right away. nelda, gretchen, suzanne- all of you- rest in peace. robert. sir? i want you to take all the servants downstairs to my workroom. just stay there until i come. have our services been unsatisfactory, sir? robert, i have given you an order. you are, all of you, to go downstairs and wait for me. but i've been an excellent butler, sir. you know i have. i think you'll agree with me. i came very well- recommended, sir. there isn't a more efficient maid in the entire country. i can fix anything that has to be fixed. no more! robert, you have your orders. it's all over. we're alone in the house now. alone, william? yes, my dear. quite alone. you and i and our daughter. i've become so accustomed to them. it'll be difficult at first, won't it, william? yes, my dear, a little, in the beginning. oh, mother. we're going to live like normal people do you understand? normal people. we're going to give parties and we'll take trips and we'll make friends and i'll find a young man. i'll find a young man and, before you know it, we're going to have grandchildren. oh, father, grandchildren. what's the matter? what is it? it's what you said about grandchildren. you see, what your mother means, jana... what she means is it's perfectly normal and natural for parents to think of their children as children. and then, when suddenly they grow up and they talk of having children of their own, it's a little difficult for parents to absorb quite so quickly. something's not right. something's not right. something's not right. what is it? why aren't any of my pictures in the photo albums? there are no pictures of me here at all. jana, dear, there are many pictures of you. here's a picture of you at easter. why, there are pictures of you decorating the christmas tree last year. not as a little girl, mother. there are no pictures of me as a little girl. pictures of you and father and the robots. always pictures of the robots- 10 years ago, 20 years ago- but no pictures of me. why? i want you to tell me why. why? it's not true. oh, it couldn't be true. please tell me it's not true. jana... you are our daughter- you know you're our daughter- and you remember everything from your childhood. you remember the schools you went to, the children you played with, and you remember all the places you went to. you do remember them, jana? you've got to. why have i got to remember them? because you fed them to me? a memory track. what am i? oh, please, tell me what i am. it doesn't make any difference. it doesn't make any difference at all, jana. we were childless. we had nothing of our flesh to leave behind- nothing of our hearts, nothing of our love. so, you see... we got you. you made me. you built me. you manufactured me. of course, the maid was built as a maid, the butler manufactured as a butler, and the cook and the handyman, all for a particular purpose. and the daughter... you built a daughter! jana, i created you as a thing of love. it doesn't matter what you are or how you got here. you're our daughter. jana, you've got to understand that. you're our daughter. i can't be your daughter. i'm a thing. i'm a machine. a machine! jana, jana. no pain. no pain at all! no pain. jana, stop it! no pain. no love. i can't even feel love. oh! william, what will we do? everything's changed now. she'll never be the same. what will we do, william? william, you wouldn't. no, i couldn't do anything like that. i couldn't stand not having her here anymore. i just couldn't stand that. jana, jana, jana... just a little to the left, nelda. not quite so hard. of course, mrs. loren, of course. should you be worn out by the rigors of competing in a very competitive world, if you're distraught from having to share your existence with the noises and neuroses of the 20th century, if you crave serenity but want it full-time and with no strings attached, get yourself a workroom in the basement, and then drop a note to dr. and mrs. william loren. they're a childless couple who've made comfort a life's work, and maybe there are a few do-it-yourself pamphlets still available in the twilight zone. rod serling, creator ofthe twilight zone, will tell you about next week's story after this word from our alternate sponsor. and now, mr. serling. an attractive and rather imposing room lived in by a man named templeton. and, like most rooms, suggestive, really, of only a part of the man- the outside part. our story next week takes off from here. mr. brian aherne lends us his considerable talents in a script by e. jack neuman called ""the trouble with templeton."" it can best be described as poignant, provocative, and a highly-diverting trip into the twilight zone. captioned by media access group at wgbh access. wgbh. org be sure and see the colgate-palmolive company's new comedy show my sister eileen wednesday night on many of these same stations."
1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"you're traveling through another dimension- a dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind, a journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination. your next stop, the twilight zone. ladies and gentlemen... ladies and gentlemen, may i have your attention, please? now, no birthday celebration is complete without an after-dinner speech. oh, no, jerry. and so, let's get to the business at hand, the honoring of dr. william stockton. now, jerry harlowe, you sit down. who today is one year older and admits to being over 21. and who, in the short space of 20 years has taken care of not only us, our children, but even our grandchildren. whose grandchildren? as a matter of fact, i doubt if there's anyone in this room who still does not owe the good doctor for a visit or two. what about the hammering at all hours of the night? that's another thing we owe him for. ah, yes, yes, the good doctor's bomb shelter. well, i'm afraid we'll have to forgive him for all that despite the fact that what he sees as farsightedness has been a real pain in the neck to the rest of us, what with all the concrete trucks and the nocturnal hammering and all the rest of it. that's better. well, at any rate, when grace mentioned that it was the good doctor's birthday, we all decided to take a hand in the proceedings. i had an idea something was going on. no, you didn't. oh, yes, i did. and doc, as a little personal aside, i'd like to conclude this way. that'll probably be the best part of the speech. doc, you're a very beloved fellow and rightly so. and you may not have the biggest practice in medical history... that's true. ...but there isn't a single sawbones in the entire 50 states whose patients have such a regard- such affection, such respect- for their man with the little black bag as we do for ours. well done! you dirty dog. first a surprise party, which i abhor, and then that sloppy, sentimental speech. you ought to be ashamed of yourself. i thought it was pretty good, bill. let's take our coffee in the other room, huh? pop, pop! yes, paulie, what is it? the picture went out on the tv set. then there was some goofy announcement. hold it, everybody. shh, shh! what did you say, paul? the announcer said something about turn to the conelrad station on the radio. are you sure that's what you heard? i didn't hear wrong, pop. he said, ""turn to the conelrad station"" and then everything went completely blank. direct from washington, d.c. repeating that: four minutes ago, the president made the following announcement. i quote: ""at 11:04 p.m. eastern standard time ""both our distant early warning line ""and ballistics early warning line ""reported radar evidence of unidentified flying objects ""flying due southeast. ""we have been unable to determine ""the nature of these objects, ""but in the interests of national safety, we are declaring a state of yellow alert."" the civil defense authorities request that if you have a shelter already prepared, go there at once. come on, marty. if not, use your time to move supplies of food, water and medicine to a central place. keep all windows and doors closed. if you're in your home, go to your prepared shelters or to your basement. what you're about to watch is a nightmare. it is not meant to be prophetic, it need not happen. it's the fervent and urgent prayer of all men of goodwill that it never shall happen. but in this place, in this moment, it does happen. this is the twilight zone. fill up as many as you can, grace. i'm going to check the air filter down there. we'll get the rest of the stuff later. looks like we'll lose the power any minute now. bill, there's hardly any water coming through this tap. easy, honey. easy. now make believe it's perfume, and it cost a hundred dollars an ounce. maybe in an hour or so, it'll be worth even more than that. what else, pop? you got all the canned goods down, paulie? yeah, all i could find. how about the fruit cellar, paul? i put those in, too. uh, go up to my bedroom and get my bag and put that in, too. wh-what about the books and stuff? paul! your father told you to get his bag. there's time, grace. there's plenty of time. and we'll need books and things. i don't know how long we'll have to stay down there. what about lightbulbs? where do you keep the lightbulbs? oh, on the top shelf here of this cupboard, bill. oh, we don't have any. i ran out. well, i was going to buy some at the store yesterday because there was a sale on and... oh, bill, i'm talking like some idiot. now, how much more time is there? there's no telling, grace, honey. conelrad says from the first alarm we might have anywhere between 15 minutes and a half an hour. fif-fifteen minutes? i'm just winging it, grace. i don't know for sure. i don't think anyone does. now keep filling them. bill?! there's no more water. it doesn't make any difference anyhow. i think we've got enough water. you bring a jug with you, gracie. paul and i will get the rest. now, you two stay here. i'll get the rest of the water. no, wait a minute. i've slipped. paulie, there's a small tool kit in the garage. will you get it? right. i'll get the rest of the water. grace. now, if it is a bomb, there's no assurance it'll land near us, and if it doesn't... but if it does, bill, new york is only 40 miles away. and new york's going to get it, we know that. so we'll get it, too, all of it- the poison, the radiation, the whole mess. we'll get it. we'll be in a shelter, grace, and with any luck at all, we'll survive. we've got food and water enough to last us for two weeks- maybe even longer if we use it wisely. then what, bill? then what? we crawl out of here like gophers to tiptoe through all that rubble up above? the rubble and the ruin and the bodies of our friends? oh, bill, why is it so necessary to survive? what's the good of it? wouldn't it just be better and easier, just quicker if we just... i got the tools, pop. anything else you need from out here? grace, that's why we have to survive. that's the reason. he may only inherit rubble now, but he's 12 years old. he's only 12 years old, grace. now. this is conelrad, your emergency broadcasting station. paulie. i got the tools, pop. good- put it down over there. i'll get the rest of the water. remain tuned to this frequency. we repeat our previous announcement... how's it going, bill? it's going fine, jerry. we're collecting water which is what you should be doing. well, we collected about 30 gallons and then the water stopped. you better get into your shelter- into your basement- and i'd board up the windows if i were you. you got any wood...? bill, we don't have any cellar, remember? the advantages of modern architecture. we got the only brand- new house on the block. we got everything at your fingertips- even got an electric laundry room. all the wonders of modern science taken into account except that thing that's heading for us right now. jerry, come on. can i bring martha and the kids over here? over here? we're sitting ducks over there- no protection at all. oh, jerry. you can use our basement. your basement? what about your shelter? it's the only place we can survive! i don't have any room, jerry. there's not near enough room or supplies. it's designed for three people. well, we'll bring our own food and water. we'll sleep standing up. bill, you've got to help me. you've got to keep my family alive. we won't use any of your stuff. what about air? that's a 10x10 room, jerry, with an air filter designed will you bring your own air? well, just give us a chance. 48 hours, bill, then we'll get out. when that door gets closed and locked it stays closed and locked, jerry. there'll be radiation and heaven knows what else. i'm sorry, jerry, as god is my witness, i am sorry, but i built that for my family. what about mine? what'll we do? just rock on the front porch while we burn to a crisp? that's no concern of mine. right now it's my family i have to worry about. do you think i'm going to stand by and watch while my wife and children die in agony? i'm not going to do it, you understand? bill, i'm not going to do it! i'm sorry, please forgive me. i kept telling you, jerry- all of you- get ready, build a shelter. forget the card parties and the barbecues for maybe a few hours a week, forget them, and make the admission to yourself that the worst was possible. but you didn't want to listen, jerry. none of you wanted to listen. to build a shelter was to admit to the kind of age we lived in, and none of you had the guts to face that. so now you've got to face something far worse, jerry. so, god, please, god protect you, jerry. it's out of my hands. it's simply out of my hands. it's got to be god. it's got to be god. they're already in the shelter. marty, i told you. he's locked himself in. he's got to let us in. we have no windows in half the basement and i don't have anything to plug them up, either. and the basement won't help, anyway. i can't help you, marty. he's downstairs? yeah, yeah. bill, bill... bill, it's marty. we've got the kids with us. marty! bill! bill, please let us in. marty, please. come back and get us... please! bill- bill, it's marty. please let us in. marty, i would if i could. do you understand? i swear to you, i would. bill, please. please, bill. it's marty. i can't, marty. don't stand there asking me. i can't! i can't and i won't! i feel sorry for you, then, bill. i really do. you probably will survive, but you'll have blood on your hands. you're a doctor! you're supposed to help people! that was a million years ago... a million years ago. marty! get out of here! do you hear me? get out of here, marty! marty! then he slammed the door right in my face. well, go back! jerry, ask him again. let's go. jerry, ask him again! ask him again! please, i don't want to be here. please, frank, let's go home! there's no time! it's no use, frank. he won't let anybody in. what'll we do? we ought to find one basement and go to work on that. pool all of our stuff. it just isn't fair! he's perfectly safe while our kids have to sit around and wait for a bomb to drop! why don't we just go down there and break down the door! frank, frank- wait a minute, frank! frank, wait a minute! we can't all fit in that bomb shelter. we'd be crazy to even try. why don't we pick out one family- draw lots? i keep telling you, he won't let anybody in. we could all go down there and tell him the whole street is against him. what good would it do? even if you break down the door, we can't all fit. we'd be killing everybody. if it saves even one of my kids it's worth it. jerry, you know him better than any of us. you're his best friend. go down there again. talk to him, plead with him. tell him to pick out one family. we'll draw lots or something. one family... meaning yours, marty, huh? why not? i've got a three- month-old baby. is your baby any more precious than one of my kids? i never said that. look, if you're going to argue about who deserves to live... you shut your mouth, weiss. take it easy. let go! that's the way it is when the foreigners come over here- pushy, grabby, seml-american! why, you garbage-brained idiot! marty- marty, please! what's the matter with you? weiss, for my dough, you're at the bottom of the list! keep it up, you'll slaughter each other! marty... marty... marty, please. go down to the shelter. ask him, marty, please. i've already asked him. it won't do any good! searchlights. let's go take a look. anything new on the radio? no. what are you doing out here? doc's got himself locked in that shelter. you know what i'm going to do? i'm going down there and get him to open up that's the only thing frank's right. come on, let's do it. no, wait a minute! martha, keep those kids in the kitchen. bill! bill stockton! you've got a bunch of your neighbors outside who want to stay alive. now, you can open that door and figure out with us how many can come in there or you can just keep on doing what you're doing, and we'll bust our way in there! bill, can you hear me? this is jerry. they mean business i mean business in here. i've already told you, jerry. you're wasting your time. you're wasting precious time you could use for figuring out how you can survive. why don't we get some kind of battering ram? yeah, let's go to bennett avenue. phil klein has some heavy pipe in his basement. no, no- that would get him into the act, too, and who cares about saving him. if we do that- if we let all those people know about the shelter on our street- we'd have a whole mob to contend with. a whole bunch of strangers. what right have they got to come over here? this isn't their street. this isn't their shelter. oh, oh, this is our shelter, huh? and on the next street, that's another country. patronize home industry. you idiots, you fools, you're insane. all of you. maybe you don't want to live. maybe you don't care! i care- believe me, i care. i want to see the morning sun come up, too. but a mob doesn't have you're proving it! i say let's get that battering ram and we'll tell klein to keep his mouth shut. wait a minute. i agree with jerry. we should stop and think a minute. now, i think that... nobody cares what you think- you or your kind. i thought i made it clear. yes, but i think that jerry has... i think the first order of business is to get you out of here. marty, marty! let's get that battering ram and break down that door. you've had your chance, stockton, remember that! you've had your chance! come on, marty, come on. bill... who are those people? those people... those people are our neighbors, our friends, the people we've lived with and alongside for 20 years. come on, paulie, we better get up some of this furniture so we'll have some protection in case that door goes through. come on, let's get it in there. come on, over it. over it. now! it's through! put it down! this is conelrad. remain tuned for an important message. the president of the united states has just announced that the previously unidentified objects have now been definitely ascertained as being satellites. there are no enemy missiles approaching. there are no enemy missiles approaching. the objects have been identified as satellites. they are harmless, and we are in no danger. the state of emergency has officially been called off. we are in no danger. there is no enemy attack. thank god. marty? marty? i, uh... i went off my rocker. well, you can understand that, can't you? i just went off my rocker. i didn't mean any of those things i said to you. we were... we were, all of us so scared, so confused... well, it's no wonder, is it? i mean, you can understand why we all blew our tops a little. well, i don't think marty's going to hold it against you, frank. just like i don't think bill is going to hold all we'll pay for the damages, we'll take up a collection we... we could have a block party tomorrow night or something. a big celebration, huh? i think we rate one now. hey, that's a great idea- anything to get back to normal, huh? normal? i don't know. i don't know what normal is. i thought i did once. i don't anymore. i told you we'd pay for the damages, bill. damages? i wonder. i wonder if any one of us has any idea what those damages really are. maybe one of them is finding out what we're really like when we're normal- the kind of people we are just underneath the skin. i mean all of us. a lot of naked, wild animals who put such a price on staying alive that they'll claw their neighbors to death just for the privilege. we were spared a bomb tonight, but i wonder. i wonder if we weren't destroyed even without it. no moral, no message, no prophetic tract. just a simple statement of fact: for civilization to survive, the human race has to remain civilized. tonight's very small exercise in logic from the twilight zone. rod serling, creator ofthe twilight zone, will tell you about next week's story after this word from our alternate sponsor. and now, mr. serling. next week we move back in time to april, 1865- the aftermath of the civil war, and a strange dusty road that leads to a most unbelievable adventure. on our show next week, ""the passersby."" this one is for civil war buffs, the mystics amongst you, or any and all who would want a brief vacation in the twilight zone. be sure and watchgunsmoke starring james arness, saturday nights over most of these same stations."
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"good evening ladies and gentlemen, tonight's topic is self-defense, a matter of importance to everyone, especially the ladies, the first rule is to be suspicious of strangers, especially if they are stripped to the waist, and have arranged mattresses on the floor in advance, in nine cases out of ten they are jujitsu instructors, put out your hand and appear to be friendly, then pick out a corner of the room, i have a feeling im not going to pass this course, i won't tell him why it was he couldn't throw me, he was standing on my foot, now our story follows this one minute attack, on your sensibilities against which there is no defense. self defense goodevening. im sorry i haven't any change. you can't break a five?

-no. well, now please don't misunderstand me, i think you shed a lot of nerve going after that kid, but, that thing had been stolen from you, and you didn't even know mrs grubber, why'd you take such a risk? because he pointed his gun at me. ill get you. look when i was in the army in world war ii, i served in france and belgium and germany, never on the line though i never had to kill any, but, i did see a man get killed once though. i uh was outside a bar in brussels, a british soldier, a friend of his shot him, by mistake i think, they were having an argument about a girl and and this one fellow had a gun and, and he kept pointing at the other one and they kept yelling at each other, and and all of a sudden that the gun went off, and that was the end of a man's life, and and the one who got shot i was watching him and, he kept wanting to do something, he kept looking at that gun, that was pointed at him, and he he didn't know what to do, it made me realize how special a load gun is when it's pointed at you, and tonight when that kid pointed that gun at me, and i thought what makes him think that he can do this to me? and i i had to fight back, i... homicide, homicide lieutenant schwartz, oh yeah, oh well uh haven't called me back as soon as he's free, huh? look lieutenant uh do you suppose i could make a phone call my friends are probably, wondering what happened to me. yeah, sure, as far as that goes you can leave now. now we know where to get in touch with you. i suppose it sounds empty to say i wish it hadn't happened. mr clark, don't let it throw you, man's got a right to defend himself. oh yeah, yeah. right over here ma'am, have a seat. ill tell the lieutenant you're here. -lieutenant?

-is what true? -that the kid i shot was carrying an empty gun. yes but there wasn't any way you could have known that. excuse me doc go ahead, hmm, yeah, she's waiting outside the office, yeah ill tell her, well you did the best you could, okay doc thanks for calling. philips boy died five minutes ago. ...that are the dead who die in the lord, from henceforth yea saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labors and, their works do follow them, the peace of god which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge of love of god, and of his son jesus christ our lord, and may the blessings of god almighty, the father the son and the holy spirit, be upon you now and remain with you all, amen. excuse me, uh, -are you a relative of mrs phillips. -no. -she works for me, why? - you run the answering service? that's right. who are you? my name's clark, gerald clark, im the man who killed her son. oh, what do you want? i know how she must feel about me and i, i don't expect to change that but i, i was wondering if there isn't something that i could do to help, uh uh im not trying to buy my way out of this but, but well the funeral maybe i could pay for that. ive already taken care of it. -then may i share the cost with you. -well this isn't necesary. she wouldn't have to know about it i wouldn't want her to, i would consider it a favor, please. -is it enough? -this is very thoughtful of you. that's the least i can do, mr uh... -will, henry will. -im im glad to know. -thanks for letting me help. -forget it, and don't punish yourself too much about this, i knew jimmy, his mother's a fine woman but, he wasn't the angel she likes to think he was, his death's been very hard on her sure but, no matter how you add it up it was his own fault, eventually she's going to have to face that. uh, mrs phillips. mr clark? mr clark, the reason i, came here today is because this morning when i came to work, mr willet told me about the, money you gave him yesterday. oh i wish he hadn't done that. im glad he did i im im very grateful, well, it's nothing it's nothing at all, -i just wanted to help. -well you you've helped, and it was most generous, i um, i had a a long talk with lieutenant schwartz, and he's trying to make me see what happened and how jimmy... uh, mrs phillips. thank you, im trying to come to terms with it and i, i thought maybe perhaps you might help. well certainly uh, anything mrs phillips. i wondered if you'd talk to me. well uh, anytime mrs phillips anytime at all. -now? -well id like to. but im just on a coffee break i, how about when i get through working tonight im off at 8:30? -that will be all right. -um, well where should we meet? it doesn't matter, somewhere where we might talk. uh, there's a coffee shop right around the corner al's. yes i i know the place but, isn't it rather noisy? yes. well my place is just a few blocks from here, could we meet there? yes, yes i think that would be fine. that's 2114 hope street apartment 11. apartment 11. all right. -nine o'clock? -yes nine o'clock we'll be fine. thank you. good evening mrs phillips, won't you come in? thank you. -may i take your coat. -yes thank you. -did you have any trouble finding the place? -no. the numbers on the mailbox are in sequence, but the way they have the apartments ringed around the swimming pool, it's pretty easy to miss the one that you're looking for. you have a lovely apartment mr clark. well thank you it's uh it's comfortable may i get you something a, coffee or a drink i have some imported beer. -coffee would be fine. i won't be a minute. -mr clark. -yes. as i told you i had a long talk with lieutenant schwartz. well maybe it's too soon to talk about it. -no. -we don't have to. yes we do i want to. whatever you say. lieutenant schwartz explained to me what happened that night, and i read mrs grubbers statement so im, not trying to minimize what jimmy did. mrs phillips there's no point in blaming jimmy now. oh what he did was wrong, walking into the, store with a gun scaring people half to death, that poor old lady mrs grubber. yes. and you, you were frightened too, -weren't you? -very. because you thought he'd shoot you, -kill you. -that's right. after jimmy left the store you took the grubbers gun and followed him. yes. -and shot at him. -i shot at the car. how many times did you shoot? i don't remember. lieutenant said four shots had been fired. -then i guess they were. -and the three of them hit jimmy. yes. after you fired the first shot why did you fire the second? because all it did was smash the window. but you just said you were only shooting at the car. i meant i was shooting to stop the car. and after the second shot did the car stop? yes. then why did you fire the third? -because i was afraid. -but jimmy didn't fire back at you. but that didn't mean he wouldn't i didn't know his gun was empty. and even after that, after shooting at him three times and not having any fire return, you still walked up to the car, and fired another shot. yes because he might have been lying there waiting for me. -with an unloaded gun? -but i didn't know that. -and it never occurred to you? -why should it. he stuck a gun in my back and he threatened me you don't know what that's like, you don't know how it feels having a gun pointed at you, i had every reason to believe that gun was loaded, what would you think, what would anybody think? im sorry about your son mrs phillips, im so sorry i can't see straight, but i i don't know what else i can say. i didn't start this, i didn't want it to... this gun is loaded mr clark. listen you don't know what you're doing. don't, don't i didn't know his gun was empty, -i was just frightened. -the way you're frightened now? i was trying to defend myself that's all, what good will it do to kill me? you'll just ruin your own life, what will it solve it won't bring it back, you'll be killing me for nothing, for no reason in the whole world, im not the one who started this trouble with your son mrs phillips he did, i thought his gun was loaded i swear, you don't have to be afraid anymore mr clark, im not going to kill you, goodbye mr clark. i told you not to point a gun at me. i realize it's impolite to point, but geralds reaction was a trifle drastic, i think you too will be glad to know, that he was subsequently apprehended, as he emptied his revolver into the figure, of uncle sam in an army recruiting poster, and now i shall be back after this word from a very prudent gentleman, who points with pride but only to himself. that is all we have to offer tonight, we shall be back next week with more of the same, until then, good night."
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"hello, creeps. i'll be with you in a moment. i was just in the middle of cramming for my final exams. bet you didn't know your pal the crypt keeper was still in school. as a matter of fact, i'm at the top of my class at horror-vard! which brings us to tonight's all-frighter. it concerns a couple of college kids who've got their own ideas about higher dead-ucation, in a bit of hack-edamia i call creep course. egyptology laboratory creep course the 18th dynasty produced some of the greatest rulers ever to hold the throne of egypt. these immensely powerful pharaohs commanded loyalty and fear throughout an empire that stretched from nubia in the south to the borders of northern syria. which brings us to the legend of the pharaoh ramseth, also known as ""the mummy who wouldn't die."" it seems that old ramseth was a possessive and jealous sort of fellow, and the object of his obsession was a beautiful young maiden, princess nefra. unfortunately, ramseth tossed his mortal coil before actually consummating his relationship with the lovely nefra. so, despite his newly acquired status as an embalmed and mummified corpse, he emerged from his tomb on the anniversary of his death and each year after to search the city for the princess nefra. needless to say, ramseth's jealous disposition and bad temper had not improved in death, and the local citizens so feared and dreaded his annual rampage that they were forced to arrive at a drastic solution. each year, a maiden was delivered to ramseth's tomb, a human sacrifice. each time, the crazed old mummy would expect to see his beloved nefra standing before him, and each time he would be disappointed. exploding in anger, he vented his rage upon the innocent young woman in a manner... really too horrible to describe. but it kept the old boy off the street. so, remember, scholars, midterm exam on friday covering the first 3 egyptian kingdoms. and what are those kingdoms again... mr. skulnick? the first 3 kingdoms- those would be... we're waiting, mr. skulnick. you have us on the edge of our seats, and feel free to consult your notes or your play book or whatever that is you have in front of you. i think one is the second dynasty? kingdoms, mr. skulnick, not dynasties! the first 3 kingdoms! i don't know, sir. miss bishop. will you please give mr. numskull- i beg your pardon- mr. skulnick the answer to the question he is struggling to recall from his memory of mush? uh, early dynastic old kingdom, and, uh, first intermediate period. did you hear that, mr. skulnick? are you listening? do i at long last have your attention? yes, sir. if you fail to pass this test, mr. skulnick, you will be ineligible to participate in the one activity at which you truly excel. and although i personally rank football below keelhauling as a cultural experience, i believe it has some importance to you and your classmates. just a word to the wise, mr. skulnick. class dismissed. let me help you with that. thank you, it's fine. you're stella, right? your name is stella? yes, it is. reggie skulnick. yeah, i know who you are. working hard, i see, huh? it's just a couple hours a day. you know, it's more convenient working on campus than off, stella! and, uh... uh... excuse me. professor finley is really on my case, i mean, how do you like the way well, it wasn't... i mean, i've got feelings, too. it was pretty embarrassing for me. yeah, i could see that. now, stella, i'm gonna flunk that midterm unless you help me. me? will you, stella? please? oh, i don't know. please, please, please, stella. come on, you know the subject inside and out! it would mean a lot to me. well, i suppose i could help you study. that's what i'm really good at. i mean i- i'm not a brain or anything, but i do take excellent notes. i mean, we-we could go over them together, if that's what you mean. is, uh, later this afternoon ok? yeah, yeah. well, were should we meet? let's meet in the library, let's say, uh, 3:00? ok, yeah. ok, great. it's a date, then? see ya, stella. ok. bye. hi. sorry i'm late. oh, you are? oh, i didn't um... you didn't bring any stuff? that's ok, that's ok. i have everything we need. i've got pen, i've got paper, stella? hmm? this isn't going to work. what? studying won't help me. i'm just not cut out for it. i've tried. i mean, i really have. but nothing ever seems to stick. finley's right, i mean, the only thing i'm good at is football. sure. i understand. stella, wait. now, there is something you can do for me. hmm? now, finley keeps a collection of old egyptian stuff you could make an appointment to go over there, have a look at this junk... for extra credit or something. he'd go for it in a second. you could do it tomorrow night. ooh... why would i want to do that? because... when you have him distracted, i'm going to go in there and make a copy of the midterm. i couldn't do that. you know, everybody looks at me, and they think i've got it made, like i don't have a care in the world. but they're wrong, stella. i'm really scared. football is the only future i've got, and it's about to go down the drain. but it would be wrong. if anybody gets in trouble, it'll be me, not you. i promise you, stella. i will protect you. nobody will know. now, after the game, there's going to be just for the team, and i want you to come with me. i want you to be my date. no, you don't. you don't want yes, i do. no, you don't. why would you want to take me? why wouldn't i? because you're stella the bookworm? stella the wallflower? huh? that's what they think, isn't it? but they're wrong, aren't they? just like they're wrong about me. no, not altogether. i see... who you really are, stella. i see what everybody else misses. i can't see at all without my glasses. ah, miss fisher, how nice to see you. good evening, professor finley. please, come in. thank you. and th-th-thank you so much for allowing oh, don't be silly. my home is always open to my students. i just wish more of them had your interest and curiosity. uh, let's just go downstairs. i've got everything ready. downstairs? yeah, right this way. wow. this is like a museum. well, my grandfather was one of the first archaeologists to explore the tombs in the valley of the kings. all of these artifacts are really very valuable. this is incredible. what's this? you have a good eye, my dear. that's the pride and joy an actual burial chamber, a tomb? that's right. you want to look inside? well, i-no, i don't think so. oh, nonsense. it's the best part. go on in. ooh, it's cold. well, you get used to it. how did the torches get lit? well, like i said, everything's ready. i should go. bullshit. come back! get in there! professor finley, let me go! come on! reggie! reggie, help me! vic, you son of a bitch. reggie, help me! please! what's the matter with you? can't you do anything right? aah! hey! hey, wait. this isn't funny! open up! women are getting stronger these days, must be that damn workout trend. you're just out of shape. fuck you, jocko! let's get out of here. i got one thing to do first. reggie! open the door! come on! let me out! this isn't funny, man! let's go upstairs. i need a drink. whew! oh, my god. ramseth... ramseth. don't you know who i am? it's me... princess nefra. it's me. princess nefra. that is my grandfather- flinders finley. what an archaeologist. that grave-robbing son of a bitch looted tombs up and down the nile. ramseth's been in our family for passed on from father to son. sort of a sacred trust. curse is more like it. why don't you just burn the whole house down? you idiot. ramseth is a living connection the greatest treasure in all of antiquity, and he's mine! the only problem is that maidens are getting harder and harder to find ha ha. sick. you are very sick. you look like a malt liquor man but try this anyway. cheers. ok, doc. i've lived up to my end of the deal. now it's time you lived up to yours. what's your hurry? slow down. relax. enjoy your drink. hand over the midterm first. if you insist. c- plus. surely you don't expect a better grade than that. no, the grade's fine. it just isn't enough. what are you talking about? i believe i have you over a very large barrel here. and i bet that some of that stuff you have hoarded away downstairs is worth a small fortune. why, you miserable little rat turd. are you trying to blackmail me? just think of it as a last-minute but, uh, i like the original terms. ah, but i don't. you know, in the classroom, you run the show. now... i'm calling the shots. you-you really don't listen during class, yeah, well, this isn't school not even during the lecture on the ancient art of embalming, as i recall. even the dimmest bovine-brain nitwit usually perks up during the embalming lecture. it's just so gross. what's your point? do you recall what i said this instrument was used for? for removing the brain through the nose. i'm impressed. are you done? not yet. do you remember, reggie, how the ancient embalmers removed the other internal organs? who cares? they would mix a potion... call it a drink... which they would pour down the corpse's throat. after a short time, the organs would dissolve into a thick sludge which would ooze from the body through the mouth and the ass. you're trying to psych me out. no, reggie. i'm trying to kill you. wait a minute. you drank it, too... professor. did i? did you see me pour both drinks from the same decanter? no, of course not. how could you? you weren't paying attention, as usual. you son of a bitch. reggie, how embarrassing. you look like the poster boy shit! goddamn mess. oh, well. all in the name of history and science. all right. what the hell is- stella! you're alive. call me princess nefra. mmm, he does. i don't believe this. this is impossible. i'm the perfect student. i listen in class. i take excellent notes. what? i listen! in class! to your stupid, boring lectures! i write down every word you say. so i figured it out. the legend of ramseth and nefra. the mummy who wouldn't die, all that shit. i remembered it all. so i played along with this sack of rags, and, boy-ha ha- was he happy to see me. do you understand what i am saying? y- y-you mean that you and he... yes! gee. how could you do this to me? just keep your voice down. i think it's upsetting him. no, it's ok. you know, there was you said in class. about how jealous ramseth was? let's see if you were right. now, don't, don't, stella. oh, professor finley, one little kissie-wissie for no, no, stella! for your favorite student. no, no, no, no, no! look what i found. ah, oh, no, no. no-oh-oh! aah! aah! i'm edna cume, dean of women. this is stella bishop. what's going on? my name is detective connors, miss bishop. is there something wrong? i'm afraid so. it's about your class project. did i get a good grade? let's go, stella. we'll talk about it downtown. egyptian mummies class project by stella bishop very food a+ i guess that's a wrap for reggie and professor finley. you know what they say, kiddies- nefra say nefra again. as for me, i've got to get back to my corpse catalogue and decide on a major. i thought about going pre-dead, but i think i'd be better at shriek-onomics."
0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0," station log, stardate 46910.1. chief o'brien has escorted his wife back to earth to celebrate her mother's 100th birthday. ln the meantime, the rest of us are trying to keep the station up and running. lt's almost as if the refiltration processors were waiting for chief o'brien to leave before breaking down. this technology looks like something the cardassians must have taken from the romulans. ls that an rcl type-1 matrix field? perhaps we should call in a romulan repair service. or an rcl type-2? - another raktajino? - lt'll keep me up all night. l can think of better ways to keep you up. they're more fun than drinking klingon coffee. definitely type-1. dax. l really should be getting to bed. may l escort you to your quarters? - that's not necessary, julian. - oh. well, good night, then. not necessary, julian. but not forbidden, either. dax. yes? - you are dax? - what do you want? dax! - yes, major? - l'm just not sure, commander. what does it look like to you? lt looks like a residual charge in the graviton generator. lf it is, it'll bleed off. let's run a quick level-3 diagnostic. bashir to ops. - ops. - three people... l think they just took jadzia. she struggled and l tried to help, but... full station security alert. secure all turbolifts. seal off airlocks for levels 4 through 12. computer, locate lieutenant dax. - level six, corridor one. - no! that's where l am. - they left her combadge. - how long ago? not sure. what are you doing? we turn right at the next corridor. they're avoiding the security tracking grid. they know a lot about the station. and maybe the speed of our runabouts. they probably have a faster escape ship. survey all high-warp ships in dock. - damn! - what? that's why we've got a residual charge. they've disabled the tractor beam. eight ships are capable of warp five, three on docking pylons, five in ports. - seal off all docking ring airlocks. - all squads to the docking ring. commence immediate inward sweep, levels 16 through 21. - l've got them - airlock five. - l'm on my way. security, report to airlock, corridor five. lsolating with cadderon forcefields. will you just tell me what you want? move. forcefield is down. they know the security override codes. they're boarding a ship. l'm trying to speed up the bleed-off process. lt's working. l'm increasing the flow to the eps wave guides. - the excess charge is neutralizing. - engage tractor beam. gotcha. bring it into docking port six, major. slowly! extremities where l can see them. you're the chief of security? are you all right? my name is llon tandro, special envoy from klaestron lv, in charge of this extradition procedure. l call this kidnapping. that is a valid warrant for her arrest. the treaty between klaestron lv and your federation allows for unilateral extradition. the charge? the fugitive dax is charged with treason and the murder of my father. the warrant says dax was responsible for the death of general ardelon tandro 30 years ago. 30 years ago? that would be curzon dax. when he was on klaestron lv as a federation mediator during their civil war. he never mentioned he'd been to klaestron lv. strange. not strange, considering these charges. let me tell you something. curzon dax was a little cavalier about life, even about his personal responsibilities from time to time. l think that was part of the reason l liked him so much. he had more faults than the usual, socially acceptable trill. - he was not a murderer. - how about a traitor? lt says dax betrayed the klaestron government to the rebels. lt's all nonsense! l knew the man. but did you know the symbiont inside the man? come in. l've sent a subspace message to klaestron lv, requesting confirmation of the warrant. that's the only stall l could think of. what the hell's going on, dax? dax, if l'm going to help you, you've got to help me. l don't expect any help, benjamin. - thank you, though. - are you crazy? treason and murder - on klaestron lv. either of those gets you the death penalty. what's the matter with you? talk to me before l have to let them take you. no. l'm sorry, benjamin, but no. we've got 18, 20 years of friendship behind us. l'm jadzia dax now. that was curzon dax you knew. so when the dax part of you survived from one host to the next, it really didn't take our friendship along. benjamin, you know you're still my very dear friend. l'm sorry. you've received confirmation. we'd like to be on our way with the prisoner. l kept wondering why you tried to kidnap lieutenant dax rather than present your warrant to me properly. - l couldn't figure that out. - l trust you have figured out that our extradition treaty is current and valid. - this station is technically bajoran. - what does that mean to us? you have no extradition treaty with bajor. that's why you tried to abduct lieutenant dax. the bajorans would refuse extradition. no bajoran interests are even involved here. how did you know your way around this station so well? my conversation is with the commander. no, your conversation is with my first officer now. you are allies of the cardassians. they must have given you the station layouts, which not only compromises bajoran security, but also... annoys us. l'm afraid bajoran interests are involved and bajor is adamant that... at least, l believe it's adamant... oh, yes. there will have to be an extradition hearing before l can release lieutenant dax. - for how long? - as long as it takes. that could be for days. - nowhere else on the station is suitable. - that's too bad. l'm not closing for any bajoran hearing. l'm sure lieutenant dax would appreciate it. business is business. you know, that wall's going to have to come in about five metres. what are you talking about? after you move the wall, your second-level holosuites will have to come down. - why? - new restrictions. - restrictions? - building codes. since the provisional government took over, they've got into everything and l'm the one who's expected to enforce their rules here. ha. you know, l think this bar is just a little too near the exit. - this is blackmail. - no, it's just business. and business is business. l was just coming to see you. we haven't found a place for the hearing. holding it on bajor would involve dax leaving and l don't want to risk that. coincidentally, quark just donated the use of his facility for the hearing. - nice gesture. - l thought so. l haven't been able to get a word out of dax. someone might do some investigating on klaestron lv. this case has 30 years of dust covering it. the hearing will take about 30 minutes. - l want to make it longer than that. - good luck. this will be an informal hearing so l'll start with some informal advice. l am 100 years old. l do not have time to squander listening to superfluous language. ln short, l intend being here until supper, not senility. - understood? - understood, madam arbiter. you seek extradition. make your case. the accused trill, whatever its present appearance may be, was and is a federation officer who committed crimes on our planet. since there is no time limit on the prosecution of such crimes... l have already read the warrant and the charges. the crimes described are 30 years old. what took you so long? the evidence was in military files which were officially sealed until recently. fine. sit. commander, the warrant is in order. on what grounds do you ask that l deny extradition? you say the warrant's in order, but the name on the warrant is dax. certainly, that doesn't refer to jadzia dax, a female, but to the now deceased curzon dax, a male. this young woman wasn't even born 30 years ago. you are arguing semantics. this creature is a trill. the symbiont has progressed from one host to the next. exactly. a different host, a different person. so the person he wants to extradite no longer exists and l challenge him to prove otherwise. that's ridiculous. lt would have been easier on me, commander, had you not raised that point, but the penalty for these crimes on your planet is death and that is permanent. so before l grant extradition, you will convince me that the person named in your warrant is the person who is standing here now. she doesn't seem to care if she gets out of this. l care. doctor, we've given the opposition access to our computers and station library so let's utilize them ourselves. find all the medical evidence you can to support the theory that jadzia dax and curzon dax are two separate people. excuse me, sir. l don't know that there is any evidence. assume there is, then find it. l'm not asking you to be an attorney but if you could check the computers for any precedents, legal decisions involving trills. ls a trill responsible for the conduct, for the acts, of its antecedent selves? - that kind of thing. - what if the answer is ''yes''? then that answer is wrong. from this minute on, our answer is ''no''. but if you do find a wrong answer... l want to see it. l can't fight what l don't know about. commander sisko, there's a subspace communication from odo on klaestron iv. we only have a few hours. - what have you got for us, constable? - l know two things so far - whoever did murder that general ardelon tandro, it got his troops so mad they won their civil war. they made the general a national hero. there are statues of him all over the place. the second, everyone that's old enough to remember says the general and curzon dax were the closest of friends, inseparable. - that sounds like the curzon dax l knew. - but treason... plus the murder of his own best friend? strange business. lf it's true l'd want to hang curzon dax up by his heels myself. - thanks for the confidence. - don't worry. l'll do my job. the general left a widow. lf the two men were that close she has to remember something about curzon dax that's not in the record. you'll hear from me. curzon dax was not responsible for the death of my husband. you're certain of that? - without a doubt. - but your own son...? my son is obsessed with the death of a father he never knew. l tried to persuade him not to reopen the case. he won't listen to anyone, least of all to me. you have to understand curzon dax was closer to the general than any other man on this planet. he was a dear friend to this family. curzon would have died himself sooner than conspire against my husband. ls that an opinion or are there facts that support this? the only facts l have are in my son's hands and he wants to use them against dax. lt may help us to know what they are. there is proof of a secret transmission that was made from our military headquarters to the enemy camp. lt identifies exactly the route my husband was taking on his way back from the capital to the front. lt was then he was ambushed and kidnapped. a short time later, he was killed. then your son must believe that dax made the transmission. there were only five people, including my husband, who knew that route. my son has established the whereabouts of all of them at the time of the transmission. all of them, except curzon. so dax has no alibi? that cannot possibly be enough to convict him. - can it? - l don't know. thank you. you've been helpful. how is he? - ma'am? - curzon dax. he's gone. the dax your son is trying to extradite is jadzia dax, a 28-year-old woman. curzon dax died two years ago. jadzia is the new host. what? l'm sorry. l didn't know. l call on the expert knowledge of another trill, selin peers. minister peers, we're fortunate to have you with us. lt also seems convenient. how do you come here? because another trill is involved, the trillian government requested l be present. and do you know the accused personally? l do not. we accept you as an expert. proceed. minister, through how many hosts have you survived? the symbiont within me has survived through seven hosts. do you remember your first host? of course. lt was a woman, as a matter of fact. do you remember what you thought, and felt, when you were joined with your first host? yes. the symbiont does carry memories of previous hosts. so if a trill commits a crime then the symbiont's next host would remain aware of it, would recall that crime? yes. absolutely. would recall the details of it? yes, absolutely. and would still feel the guilt of it? yes. this is not a trial and mr tandro is not the prosecutor. - mr tandro, you have made your point. - l don't believe l have. the real point is that commander sisko would have you endorse his idea of a perfect trill crime. all one has to do is elude capture long enough to change hosts and then he or she can go free. minister peers, you said you were with your first host throughout her adult life. yes. before a symbiont is joined with any host that host has lived a significant portion of his or her life, from birth to what age, sir? early to mid-20s. why not younger? to give the prospective host a chance to develop, mature. they have to be old enough to make a judgement as to if they really want to be joined. once they are joined, this host's personality is suppressed by the symbiont? oh, no. no, it's a joining. lt's a total sharing, a blending of both symbiont and host. neither is suppressed by the other. so with each new host, there does come, in fact, a new personality a new different person. from that standpoint, yes. l don't know from what other standpoint we could be talking about. thank you, minister. just to return us to what's important here, madam arbiter, the accused can remember any crimes she committed as curzon dax and nothing in this hearing can alter that fact. the memories were passed to a new host, to an entirely different person! this is outrageous! you can't let dax get away with murder! l said this would be an informal hearing, not riotous. we will take a two-hour recess. the answer seems simple to me - split her down the middle. send the symbiont back to stand trial and keep the host here. lt's a bit more complicated than that. what a surprise. please enlighten me. the symbiont and the host are biologically interdependent. 93 hours after they have joined, neither can survive without the other. l see. proceed, commander. doctor, you've heard the arguments. from a medical point of view, are curzon dax and jadzia dax the same person? certainly not. aside from the gender change, there's a marked difference in blood types, metabolism, height, weight. - this is not relevant. - what is relevant, sir... is my analysis of the brain waves. madam arbiter... as you can see, they are distinctly different, which clearly illustrates that curzon and jadzia are two unique individuals. thank you, doctor. doctor... l've looked through your research. lt's impressive for such a young man. thank you. as a layman, there are things l don't fully understand. l'd be happy to explain anything you wish. yes? well, exactly how does the trill brain work? lt's quite complicated, actually. - there are two cerebral nuclei... - two? one in the symbiont and one in the host. two brains. and these two brains talk to each other? like two linked computers. that's very clear, doctor. thank you. now, in your investigations were you able to analyse the separate wave patterns from each of these brains? they don't function separately. l didn't ask how they function, dr bashir. l asked if you could analyse the two distinct patterns. - l don't see the relevance... - could you? yes. have the brain wave patterns changed since it joined with its new host? with the available evidence, there's no way of telling. - what's your best guess? - l wouldn't care to guess. ls there evidence of any change at all in the symbiont since it joined with its new host? - no. - thank you, dr bashir. you've been very helpful. any more witnesses, commander sisko? yes, madam arbiter. l call the one person in this courtroom who knew curzon dax. - me. - you know where the witness stand is. with your permission, l'd like major kira to direct the questions. tell us a little about curzon dax, commander. he probably wasn't the ideal trill. he drank a little too much. he was more interested in women than he should have. l thought he was your friend. l'm pointing out that he was not at all like the young woman in this courtroom. what was, exactly, your relationship with curzon dax? he took a raw ensign under his wing and taught me to appreciate life in ways l'd never thought about before. he taught me about art and science and diplomacy. whatever sense of honour l might have today, he nurtured. treason, murder - he was not capable of those things. as you've already said, this is not a trial. l'm describing my friend, curzon dax, a man l knew very well. on the other hand, l can't tell you much about my new friend there. we're really just getting to know each other. commander, starfleet officers do have the reputation of being honourable and l judge you to be an honourable man. as such, do you think this crime should go unpunished? l prefer no crime to go unpunished. then, if it were possible, even you would not argue with punishing the symbiont part of dax. how can you be so sure the symbiont was the criminal influence? what if it were the curzon host that was responsible? then the surviving symbiont would be innocent. no. they'd both be guilty. you have argued that the two personalities, once joined, function as one. your own dr bashir confirmed it. when you put salt in water the two become indistinguishable and inseparable. l think you've just made my point for me. when the water boils off, the salt returns to its original state. pour that same salt into another liquid, you have something completely different - jadzia dax is an entirely new entity. following a one-hour recess, lieutenant dax will take the witness stand. one hour. lf you won't defend yourself, you're not going to testify. lt's a hearing, not a trial. she has no choice. sir. odo's on subspace. lt's urgent. - l've made some progress. - good. not good. since the transmission to the enemy is the key evidence, l went through the communications logs from headquarters during that period. l even found curzon dax's records. curzon would not log in a communiqué to the enemy. no, but the log shows a number of conversations between dax's office and general tandro's home. they were friends. a number of conversations took place while the general was away. - the wife? - the wife. curzon dax and enina tandro... maybe it was innocent. maybe he was providing emotional support during tough times. or maybe they were taking advantage of the general's absence. lf they were having an affair, that translates into a solid motive for murder. the conversations were just the beginning. l've also found records of gifts, of holidays spent outside the capital. - what purpose does this serve? - lt serves the truth. l hope you'll explain this, because as it stands, this will severely hurt dax's defence. my husband was not the hero in life that he was in death, mr odo. ln death, he became a legend and l became a legend's wife. there are people who did not know my husband who still contact me. - they still mourn him. - but you don't. no, because l knew the man before he became a legend. but l also know my place in history. my place is to carry on bravely, never to remarry, to represent my husband at the banquets given in his name. but never, never to talk about who he really was. because nobody wants to hear that. they may have to hear it now. no matter what is said, they will still embrace his memory... for he was, and always will be, the hero who died for his people. but perhaps it's time for my place in history to change. you've been protecting her reputation. that's it, isn't it? that's why you won't defend yourself. there are worse things than an illicit love affair. curzon didn't murder anybody. he didn't commit treason. are you willing to commit suicide over something done in another lifetime? that is what you're doing, you know. my god, dax. young tandro wouldn't be your son? you have an overactive imagination. then what is it that's holding you back? help me. damn it! lf you were still a man... l see your temper hasn't improved. - don't talk about that! - curzon warned you about it. you're not going to get me off track here. do you remember that argosian lieutenant who threw a drink in your face? and you knocked me down before l could kill him. l still have a little scar here from your ring finger. l tried on that ring after curzon died. lt just slipped off my finger. lf you don't help me, old man, they're going to take you, because l don't know any more arguments. then let it happen. lt is my obligation to protect the lives of those in my command. you taught that to me! that was curzon. l'll stop protecting you when you tell me curzon was guilty. l won't discuss it with you. as for enina tandro, l feel the shame of curzon's indiscretion. when one of my kind stumbles, benjamin, it is a mistake that's there forever. l can't tell you which part of curzon dax couldn't stop himself from acting shamefully with another man's wife. l can tell you...that he did love her, for whatever that's worth. enough to kill her husband? - so you are questioning? - what else can l do? nothing, benjamin. nothing at all. lieutenant dax, you are either 200 years older than l am or you're about the same age as my great-granddaughter. at first, l wondered which you were. now, l am bothered by the likelihood that you may be both. let's finish this, commander. at what age did jadzia first want to be joined as a trill? since l was a child. l worked very hard for it. ls the competition to become a trill very strong among potential hosts? yes. lt's considered a great honour. how did the young jadzia become a host candidate? by winning scholarships, competing against other young people. - you're tested in countless ways. - lncluding psychological tests to determine strength of character of the host? yes. and the young jadzia excelled in those tests of academics and character, of psychological stability? yes. lf you can remember other things, remember that as well. what academic degrees do you hold, lieutenant? l hold premier distinctions in exobiology, zoology, astrophysics and exoarchaeology. how many of those did you earn before joining with the symbiont dax? all of them. all of them. as jadzia. alone. this brilliant and independent young woman has done nothing in her life but contribute to her society. madam arbiter, how can anyone justify trying her for a crime committed by another entity before she was even born? this will only take a minute. lieutenant... as a trill candidate, did jadzia understand the responsibilities to be assumed upon becoming a trill, and did you accept those responsibilities and any consequences they might entail? yes. would that not include the consequences of criminal acts committed by curzon dax? may l speak? and you are? l am enina tandro, widow of general ardelon tandro. this hearing is unnecessary. the accusations are erroneous. mother, what are you talking about? madam arbiter, curzon dax is accused of sending a transmission to the enemy that betrayed my husband. but l know where curzon was when that transmission was sent. he was... in my bed. mr tandro, you will want to reexamine your extradition request. until then, this hearing is adjourned. lt was kind of you to try and protect me - someone you'd never even met. there's much of curzon that's still a part of me, that still remembers what you had together. but it was curzon dax who swore himself to silence to preserve the memory of general tandro, not jadzia. l felt it was important to keep that promise. the general's memory is cherished by your people. and it will continue to be. no one will ever know that he was the one who tried to betray us and that the rebels killed him for the favour. as for you, there is one favour l would ask. of course. live, jadzia dax. live a long, fresh and wonderful life."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0," so, there l was, fighting the toughest battle of my life, looking around, hoping to spot a friendly face, only to discover my colleagues... were gone. l was alone. l admit, for a moment l considered giving up. l could feel the seconds ticking away, panic building up. my only chance was to trust my instincts. so l closed my eyes, took a deep breath and just like that, it came to me - the answer l was looking for. a pericardial membrane! l looked down and punched the answer into my computer terminal just as the buzzer sounded, ending the exam. and that, l suppose, is the stuff salutatorians are made of. salutatorian? well, l mistook a preganglionic fibre for a postganglionic nerve during the orals or l would have been valedictorian. lt was a trick question. fascinating. not nearly as fascinating as when l... dr bashir? chief o'brien? report to landing pad five. bad timing. there'll be another time. starfleet medical finals. gets them every time. - lt's no use. - chief! we must get this hatch open. lieutenant dax and ensign pauley are trapped. the runabout barely made it back. power levels were near zero. there's not enough juice left to release the servos. life support's down. oxygen levels are dangerously low. have to burn it through. the hatch is made of duranium composite. lt'll take an hour. we don't have much time. how many passengers were aboard? - two. - l'm reading three. we need to get power to the hatch servos. hand me the epl capacitor. middle shelf. try her now. - dax? - l'm fine. check the others. - vash? - that's right. miles o'brien, from the enterprise. - yes, of course. - what are you doing on the ganges? we found her in the gamma quadrant. - she'd been there for over two years. - two years? doctor, we'd better get these people over to the infirmary. right this way. how did you get to the gamma quadrant? - a friend dropped me off. - oh. - will l live? - you're fine. ln fact... you're in remarkable shape. thank you, doctor. l try. l mean you've...managed quite well considering you've been out of contact with civilisation for two years. l'd hardly call the gamma quadrant uncivilised. some of the cultures have histories dating back millions of years. really? l'd love to hear about them. we have no idea what's beyond the wormhole. maybe l'll write a book. lt's sure to be a bestseller around here. well... no sign of disease or malnutrition or parasitic infections. you sound disappointed. l am. now l have no reason to keep you here. you almost make me wish l wasn't feeling well. she claims she knew nothing about the wormhole? she seemed surprised about it. she didn't expect to see this part of the galaxy again. how could she get there if she didn't go through the wormhole? she didn't want to talk about it. said it was a personal matter. a human alone in the gamma quadrant for two years? check her background. - she claims to be an archaeologist. - that's a good place to start. you sure this place is safe? the assay office is the most secure area on the station. the chambers are surrounded on all sides by individual force fields. and how are the locks controlled? once you secure a chamber, it can't be opened except with your personal authorization code, combined with a verified retinal print. - a cardassian mk-7 scanner? - mk-12. with an l-90 enhanced resolution filter. l suppose that will have to do. computer, begin inventory for cubicle 19. one statue... stone. 30-odd centimetres tall, approximately eight kilograms. assorted gems. gold necklace. one dagger. bronze and gold. about 25 centimetres. beautiful. l've never seen anything quite like it. some kind of promethean quartz. l thought so too, at first, but its molecular density and refraction index is much higher. remarkable. end inventory. please, enter an access code. all right. l'll pick everything up tomorrow. l've booked on the mulzirak transport. - you're not leaving us so soon? - l'm afraid so. the daystrom lnstitute will be very disappointed. the daystrom lnstitute? they want to hear about the gamma quadrant. every place you've been, everything you've seen, could be important, including how you got there. sorry, commander, but that's a personal matter. so now the daystrom lnstitute is interested in me. that's ironic. professor woo seemed eager to speak to you again. did he tell you he suspended my membership from the archaeological council? twice. something about the sale of illegal artefacts. lf it's a choice between science and profit, l'll choose profit every time. he hoped you'd make an exception. l haven't been back to earth in...it must be 12 years. here's your chance. l could arrange passage. l think l'd like that. fine. l'll take care of it. l don't understand it, commander. l can't find anything wrong with her. this ship is completely functional. - lt didn't look that way this morning. - don't get me wrong. the power reserves are empty. the inertial damping fields are barely operational and the warp drive containment field's on the verge of collapse. but there's nothing wrong with any of them. once we put power back in, she should be operational. did you check the central power linkages? yes, l ran a level-1 diagnostic. everything checks out. l can't explain it. lt's like something tapped into the ship's systems and drained them dry. how well do you know vash? l only met her one time aboard the enterprise. what was she doing there? vash and captain picard were friends - close friends, if you follow my meaning. seems they met on risa a few years back. she must be special, being friends with the captain. - she doesn't seem his type. - the captain likes a good challenge. status report? we had broad-spectrum power drain. power transfer is inoperative. the energy was drawn out faster than it could handle. chief, are you reading any graviton flux around the transfer systems? l am detecting a low-level graviton disturbance. that's what happened when we lost power on the ganges. these were cardassian living quarters. the bed may take some getting used to. as an archaeologist, l've spent half my life sleeping in tents. to me, any bed will be a luxury. you've never slept on a cardassian mattress. - lf you need anything, ask the computer. - thanks, chief. by the way, how's jean luc? the captain? the last time l saw him, he was fine. now that l'm back, l'll have to look him up. really, vash, l can't believe you're still pining for jean luc - that self-righteous do-gooder. he warned me about you. you're hurt, you strike back. but cheer up. l bring you wonderful news - l'm back. lt was cruel of me to leave you. very touching, but you didn't leave me, l left you. you left me, l left you. details! the important thing is we're a team again. - joined together at the hip. - not a chance. you're going to miss me. don't flatter yourself. l thought we'd first visit the teleris cluster, look in on the star dancers at mundahla. or head over to the lantar nebula and view the sampalo relic on hoek lv. not interested. l know, vadris lll. charming little world. the natives think they're the only intelligent life in the universe. no! you choose, then. l choose never to travel with you again. you don't know what you're missing. l promised to take you places no human had seen. and you have. lt was wonderful. - thank you. goodbye. - two years in the gamma quadrant hardly qualifies as a grand tour of the universe. there's the delta quadrant to explore, not to mention all the other galaxies. q, l want you out of my life. you are arrogant and you think you know everything. but l do know everything. that makes it even worse. what is it you really want? l want the life l had before l met you. and a stellar life, indeed. the eminent vash - barred from the royal museum of epsilon hydra vll. persona non grata on betazed. wanted dead on myrmidon for stealing the crown of the first mother. dead or alive. preferably dead. lt's a wonder you haven't offended every race in the galaxy. you almost got me killed on erriakang vll. they weren't thrilled to see you on brax. ''the god of lies.'' come in. - l... - go away. q, bring him back. what business could you have with that disgusting little troll? you didn't give him time to tell me. bring him back this instant. all right. can l help you? my name is quark. lt's come to my attention that you have access to certain items. ltems that might perhaps turn a tidy profit? l'm listening. for a percentage, l might be able to arrange a buyer for your trinkets. perhaps an auction. l'll only accept payment in gold-pressed latinum. l'll shower you in it. 50-50. mr quark, l believe you're trying to take advantage of me. some wine? you have a talent for oo-mox. so l've been told. l'll not be distracted by your feminine wiles. l demand 40%. all right, 30%. what magnificent cartilage. 22 and don't stop. you've got a deal. l expect you'll make the necessary arrangements? you're good. you're very, very good. how perfectly vile. - no wonder you ended up with picard. - go away. - enter. - aren't we the hub of activity? - am l interrupting anything? - no, come in, doctor. - please call me julian. - julian. ls this medical business? l thought of official reasons for dropping by but your good health robbed me of excuses. that didn't seem to stop you. l'll contribute to your good health by buying you dinner. quark's makes a delicious couscous and the company might be mildly entertaining. sounds like fun. though, l would like to freshen up first. could l meet you there in 20 minutes or so? those 20 minutes will seem like an eternity. these mating rituals you humans indulge in are disgusting. - get out. - you don't mean it. - out! - you'll be lost without me. - l can take care of myself. - we'll see about that. - just a cup of mint tea, please. - you're making a terrible mistake. why? the replicators haven't malfunctioned again? l'm talking about vash. stay away from her. my god, you're an impertinent waiter. l'm a friend, giving you friendly advice. she's trouble. l don't see that it's any of your business who l see. - l'm having dinner with her. - you look tired. - l feel fine. - no, you look very tired. funny, l... l do feel a bit spent. maybe l should... maybe l should go and lie down for a minute. hopefully by yourself for a change. bloody hell. the klingon scout ship has departed docking bay 11. good. l'll tell odo he can relax now. we've got a problem. l just saw q on the promenade. - here? - what's q? a powerful and unpredictable entity. l was at a starfleet briefing on him two years ago. - blasted menace. - what does he want with us? whatever it is, we won't like it. you might ask vash. they know each other. from the enterprise? they actually met in sherwood forest. lt was one of the little jokes q played on the enterprise crew. main power grid has dropped 80%. sensors are reading a massive graviton build-up. - how long before we regain full power? - lt's already normalising. lf we have an outage during a docking procedure we could lose an entire pylon! l've checked every system. there's nothing wrong with them. lt's got to be q - another one of his stupid jokes. l'm not laughing. l figured we'd auction this off last. lnteresting, but hardly of any intrinsic value. l thought it was the best piece. my associates have more sophisticated tastes than you're used to. but just so it's not a total loss, l'll buy it for seven bars of gold-pressed latinum. - lt's worth 50 times as much. - ridiculous! all right, 18, but you must never tell a soul about my foolish generosity. you'll have to be a lot more foolish than that. all right, 30. now, give it to me. bidding starts at 200 bars of gold latinum. l can't decide what's more intoxicating - this gamzian wine, or your negotiating skills. we need to talk. the lady and l are having a private conversation. lt can wait. tell me, commander, where is that doctor of yours? he was supposed to meet me here earlier. - tell me about q. - l'll tell you anything you want to know. just answer one question - is starfleet penalising you or did you actually request such a dismal command? - l want you off this station. - don't be hasty, my happy-go-lucky friend. this gulag could use a little colour, some excitement. and who better to provide that than ""moi?"" although, l must admit, l like your new tailor. l'm not impressed by your parlour tricks. these power outages are going to stop. why tell me? of course, go ahead. blame q if it makes you feel better. lt's my fate to be the galaxy's whipping boy. heavy is the burden of being me. lf you're looking for sympathy, you're in the wrong place. l was hoping for a witty repartee but l won't get any of that. at least your beloved jean luc knew how to turn a phrase. take a hint, q. no one wants you around. really, vash, this playing hard to get is growing tedious. remember, l'm the q and you the lowly human. l'll decide when this partnership is over. understand? why don't you and l continue this discussion in private? excellent idea. you're right. this is an excellent idea. - sisko to ops. - all gone. - bring them back, q. now! - or what? you'll thrash me? shall we settle this ""mano a mano?"" - marquis of queensberry rules? - what? fisticuffs, pugilism, the manly art of self-defence! come on. lsn't this wonderfully barbaric? take a poke at me. l know that's what you want to do. - l'll wager five bars of latinum on sisko. - you're on. fight back! this is supposed to be brutal. you can pay me out of your profits from the auction. you hit me. picard never hit me. l'm not picard. lndeed not. you're much easier to provoke. how fortunate for me. not again. damn it, q. enough is enough. - we're losing atmosphere. - decompression protocol. mr o'brien, raise the confinement shields. - shields up. - damage report. a minor hull breach in one of the upper bulkheads. l'm getting reports of hull fractures throughout the station. emergency systems appear to be functioning. the breach was caused by a focused graviton pulse. every time we've had a power drain it's been followed by an increase in the graviton field. we could have a breach in a reactor core. - we'd lose half the station. - maybe we should negotiate with q. l'm not convinced q is behind this. playing with the lights doesn't strike me as his style. you wanted to see me? make it quick. l have important business. yes, l know. you're auctioning off some artefacts from the gamma quadrant. you were eavesdropping on my conversation with vash. what were you this time? the table? one of the chairs? the wine bottle. when will you realise that you have no secrets from me? l have nothing to hide. l sell merchandise to select clientele. and what makes them so select? they're all ridiculously wealthy... and not too bright. l'll never understand this obsession with accumulating material wealth. you spend your entire life plotting and scheming to acquire more and more possessions until your living areas are bursting with useless junk. then you die. your relatives sell everything and start the cycle again. lsn't there anything you...desire? l have my work. what more do l need? a suit of the finest andorian silk? a ring of pure surax? a complete set of tanesh pottery? how about a latinum-plated bucket to sleep in? well, l'm glad to see you've packed. - l hope you said goodbye to your friends. - l don't have time for this. you've led a charmed life these past two years under my benevolent protection. - l can take care of myself. - really? do you remember that tiny little insect bite you had on erabus prime? lf l hadn't been there... l am not going with you. the galaxy can be a dangerous place when you're on your own. lt's over, q. l leave you now to reconsider my offer of friendship. station log, stardate 46531.2. the station's power continues to be drained and converted into gravitons. at this rate, our life-support systems will fail in 14 hours. we can't find the source of the power drain with these cardassian sensors. they're not sensitive enough. let's make the drain easier to detect. lf we flood the station with tritium gas we can trace the particle flow to the source. tritium? lsn't that toxic? only when highly concentrated. we'd only use a small amount. do it. unless we get this under control in the next eight hours we'll evacuate. still chasing your own tail? picard would have solved it hours ago. no wonder you're not commanding a starship. - security to ops. - aren't we the feisty little go-getter? l'd keep my eye on this one. chances are she's after your job. why don't you do something constructive for a change, like torment cardassians. - do l know you? - o'brien. from the enterprise. enterprise? oh, yes. weren't you one of the little people? quite a motley crew you've assembled here, benji. my advice to you is to evacuate now and save all this pointless guesswork. q, tell us what's going on or get out of the way. l'll tell you. while you conduct futile experiments vash is below engaged in base commerce and setting federation ethics back 200 years. believe me, gang, she's far more dangerous to you than l. kolos, my friend. l don't know which pleases me more - your smiling face or your overflowing purse. quark, you obsequious toad. your so-called gamma quadrant merchandise had better be legitimate or l'll toss you out an airlock. no cause for alarm. each piece comes with a statement of authenticity from vash, the federation's foremost expert on the gamma quadrant. ln that case, stop snivelling and give me a synthale. are they all that pleasant? l don't care about their manners. the important thing is they're honest collectors of antiquities. - how honest? - as honest as you and l. then we'd better keep a close eye on them. my dear, l've been thinking. what would you say to a permanent partnership? with your knowledge of the gamma quadrant and my business connections, we could make a fortune. sorry, quark, but l've slept in my last tent. l'm looking forward to a nice, quiet life back on earth. you won't last a month. you're like me. you live for excitement and profit. - not anymore. - would you care to bet on that? the graviton field has increased by 60%. when can we begin the sensor sweep? not until we've increased tritium levels to one part per million. should be another seven, eight minutes. we're being pulled out of our normal position. - use control thrusters. - firing thrusters. we're still moving. lf the graviton field is feeding off the power we can cut its supply by shutting reactors. put life-support on emergency backup. take everything else off line. we're still moving out of position. what's our heading? bearing 157 mark 13. straight into the wormhole. now, as you know, payment must be in gold-pressed latinum and all transactions are final. remember, bid high, and bid often. ladies and gentlemen, our first item is a statue from the gamma quadrant's verath system. l should take a minute to tell you about the verathan civilisation which reached its height some 30,000 years ago and spanned over two dozen systems, interconnected by a highly developed communications network. this statue represents drohlak, the prime ossemite of the 19th dynasty. - vash, what are you doing? - l'm providing a historical context. give me that. this isn't the daystrom lnstitute. watch closely. friends... it's rare... it's beautiful... and it's a gamma quadrant original! and it can be yours. bidding will start at ten bars of gold-pressed latinum. make it ten. 15? 16? who will say 17 and be the first to own a piece of the gamma quadrant? tritium levels have reached one part per million. lnitiating sensor sweep. we can rule out the docking ring. the tritium gas seems to be draining towards the central core. - where in the central core? - l'll try to get a more precise reading. lt's not clear enough. l can't pinpoint an exact location. based on our current trajectory, we'll hit the wormhole in 18 minutes. what the hell could be pulling us into the wormhole? do we have time to transfer auxiliary power to the deflectors? sir, there's not enough power left. lf we get sucked into the wormhole we'll be in a billion pieces by the time we reach the gamma quadrant. sold to kolos for 36 bars of gold-pressed latinum! next, we have... a dagger. studded with some very interesting-looking gems. think of it as a weapon and an investment. bidding will start at 40. 40. 42? 42. 45? don't hold back. you know you want it. give me 50. we have 50. l hate to interrupt such a thrilling display of naked avarice but it's only right of me to warn you that this station is hurtling towards its doom and it's unlikely that you will survive to enjoy your purchases. l just thought l'd mention it. carry on. ladies and gentlemen, l assure you everything is under control. drinks for everyone! and free use of the holosuites at the conclusion of the auction. l don't think l realised until this moment how evil you are. you'd kill all these people to get even with me. the thought had occurred to me, but this station is in enough trouble already. although l'd be glad to save you. just ask. l'll take my chances with the others. l'm going to sit right here and watch. l've never seen a space station torn apart by a wormhole before. 100! sold to my cousin stol for 105 bars of gold-pressed latinum. what if we pump more tritium gas into the central core? the sensors might be more accurate. lt might work but we'll all die from tritium poisoning. wait a minute. bring the reactors back on line. but they'll just feed more energy into the graviton field. lf we generate enough energy it should create a power drain we can trace. lt might also push us a lot faster into the wormhole. lt's a chance we've got to take. bring us to full power. - everything you've got. - aye, sir. sold to rul the obscure for 151 latinum bars! and now... our final item. and l think you'll agree with me it was well worth the wait. bidding will start at 200 bars of gold-pressed latinum. 200? can l get 250? 250. 300, anyone? 300 bars of gold-pressed latinum. - 350? - here. 400? 400. five? 520? 600 bars of gold-pressed latinum. lt's not in any of the crossover bridges or in the habitat ring. lt's in the upper core. three minutes, 14 seconds to the wormhole. we're picking up speed. l've got it. the power drain's coming from the promenade. chief, you have ops. 2500. 2501. this way. 3,000 bars of latinum. my final offer. - 3,000 bars! - a million. a million bars of gold-pressed latinum? over here. - lt's by the podium. - a million going twice... - that's it. - three times. - this auction's over. - sold. shut down the reactors. we've found it. and it's about time, too. sorry, all transactions are final. this belongs to that gentleman over there. l'm reading a massive graviton build-up inside this container. lt's increasing. we have to get it off the station. chief, lock onto my combadge. prepare to transport it 500 metres off the docking ring. - but l haven't been paid! - energise. station log, stardate 46532.3. with the embryonic life-form off the station, graviton levels have returned to normal. we've used the control thrusters to return the station to its original position. so, you're off to the daystrom lnstitute. bet you can hardly wait. long, boring lectures, endless conferences, whining students dogging your every step. sounds delightful. of course... - no, you wouldn't be interested. - ln what? l hear they've uncovered the ruins of a rokai provincial capital on tartaras v. lf you could obtain some rokain artefacts... forget it, quark. l'm going back to earth. - have it your way. - an abysmal place. - tartaras v? - earth. don't get me wrong. 1,000 years ago, it had character - crusades, spanish lnquisition, watergate. now it's just mind-numbingly dull. then by all means, don't come with me. l think you'd be much happier poking about the ruins of tartaras v. l don't need your advice. you really think l...? l still feel that l owe you a million bars of gold-pressed latinum. keep it - just give me back my life. - you'll regret it if l do. - l'll take my chances. lf you insist. but it's not going to be the same without you. when l look at a gas nebula, l just see a cloud of dust. seeing the universe through your eyes, l was able to experience...wonder. l'm going to miss that. well, l guess in some ways, l'm going to miss you, too. - maybe l could drop in some time. - god, l hope not. hey, quark. what's the quickest way to tartaras v? l feel as though l've been asleep for days. what? did l miss something?"
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"morn, no touching. you know what this is? three cases of syrup of squill. i love syrup of squill on my groatcakes but i haven't seen a jar in years. - no one has. - does that mean the drought is over? there never was a drought on balancar. it was a ploy by their farming consortium. they've been stockpiling squill in order to drive the price up. - that's dishonest. - i couldn't agree more. you see, i know the nephew of the cousin of the stepsister of a friend of the secretary to the consortium's chief accountant. nephew... cousin... stepsister... friend... yeah, that's right. and he told me in passing that the accountant had bought a pair of ferengi rain slippers. and if there was a drought, he wouldn't need rain slippers. my thoughts exactly. so, i set up a meeting with this accountant and i told him that he either provide me with a shipment of syrup or i would expose them to the entire quadrant. tomorrow morning, we are having a special on groatcakes, topped with syrup of squill. that is, for everyone who can afford it. why are you standing around? get it to the storeroom. this stuff is worth its weight in latinum. which reminds me of another little economic episode of mine. it was 11 or 12 years ago, shortly before i came on the station... dax! julian! you're back. i was worried. i told you we'd be ok. then why all the secrecy about your mission? - we weren't supposed to talk about it. - but it's ok now. the mission's over, we're debriefed. we took the defiant behind enemy lines. the first mission into cardassian space since the dominion's retreat. the first to make it back, anyway. if that isn't reason to celebrate, i don't know what is. - three synthales. - coming up. - something wrong, quark? - yes, there is. a bunch of self-satisfied starfleet officers just stole my audience. they're not just starfleet officers. they're heroes. let's face it, there's nothing heroic about earning profit. - there is on ferenginar. - we're not on ferenginar. the nagus, calling me now? ah. he must have found out about the squill. i have to send him a jar. better make it a dozen. he loves squill. there you are. i've been looking all over the station for you. well, you found me. now you go hide, and i'll search for you. rom, brace yourself. i have bad news. our mother's been taken prisoner by the dominion. moogie... a prisoner? it gets worse. the nagus wants me to rescue her. you? rescue moogie? - from the dominion? - yes. ""uh-oh"" is right. so how do you plan on rescuing moogie? you mean, how do we plan on rescuing moogie? - you didn't say the nagus wanted me. - maybe he doesn't, but i do. - besides, ishka's your mother, too. - and i love her, but i can't go with you. i'm married, i have responsibilities, and they don't want me to die. i don't want to die either, so let's just concentrate on the reward. reward? - 50 bars of gold-pressed latinum. - 50 bars! which i'm willing to share with you. - an even split? - absolutely! - 30 bars for me and 20 for you. - that's not even. it is when you include my finder's fee. right. there's one thing i don't understand. how did they get hold of moogie? they captured the transport ship she was on. but she's a female. they're forbidden to travel. the nagus gave her dispensation to travel to vulcan for her operation. - what operation? - she wanted to have her ears raised. - i had no idea. - that she was so vain? - that the nagus could be so generous. - he certainly is. but why is he being so good to moogie? there's something i need to tell you. that ten bars of latinum is an overly generous fee? i already know that. - it's about the nagus and moogie. - what about them? - they're lovers. - no... - it's been going on for over a year. - no...! she's his secret adviser. she helps him run the ferengi alliance. - no...! - would you stop saying that? may i help you, gentlemen? i was following you. - we must have taken a wrong turn. - it looks that way. much better. you know, brother, i've been thinking. we can't rescue moogie from a dominion jail. - not alone, anyway. - you're right. we'll need help. we could form a commando team, get the toughest mercenaries we can find. - nausicaans, breen, klingon! - shh! - we don't need nausicaans or klingon. - humans? - we'll just use ferengi. - then we'll all die! no, we won't! ferengi can be as tough as klingons. - they can? - of course they can. they just need opportunity, training, and some latinum as incentive. - coming out of my share, i suppose. - no! we'll split the reward with whoever joins us. - all 20 bars of it. - but the nagus offered 50. as far as anyone else is concerned, he said 20. 20 it is, then. now the only question is, who's our first recruit? - not me. - but nog... - moogie needs you. - and your nagus. they need you, we need you, say you'll join us! please. i'm a starfleet officer. i can't go running off on some half-baked rescue mission. - i have duties. - but you know how to fire a phaser. forget it, rom. don't beg. too bad, though. we were going to make you strategic operations officer. - you mean, like commander worf? - exactly like him. think of it. you'll devise the tactics, come up with a plan of action. you can be the drill instructor, prepare us for combat. - turn us into soldiers. - that's a big job. that's why we need you. - how big is the team? - right now? now, remember, leck is not your typical ferengi. - his priorities are different than ours. - i understand. - no, you don't, but you will. - i hope this is a secure channel. - i followed your instructions to the letter. - very good. - who do you want eliminated? - it's not that kind of job. - then why call an eliminator? - what's an eliminator? i'm putting together a rescue mission and i'd like you in my team. - i work alone. - you'll be paid in latinum. i don't care about latinum. you're right. his priorities are different. all right. forget the latinum. i hear you like to test your abilities. - i enjoy a challenge. - then you should know this: the person we're rescuing is being held by the dominion. - the dominion? - should be quite a challenge. how the mighty have fallen. cousin quark. i heard you were arrested on thalos vi for vagrancy. it's all your fault. i was a thriving weapons merchant... until i went into business with you. you ruined me. if i ever get out of here, cousin, i'll make you pay for what you did to me. lower the force field. now, what exactly were you going to do to me? i don't understand. quark paid your fine. you're a free man. - what do i have to do in return? - earn some latinum. tell me more. on the bar is a padd with the schematic of a dominion internment centre. you may now examine the schematic. how can we be sure these schematics are accurate? sir. no need to stand on formality here. just call me leck. - no, i meant you should call me ""sir."" - don't be ridiculous. - you mean, ""don't be ridiculous, sir."" - gentlemen, please. - we're a team, nog. - we're a team, sir. - stay out of this. nog... - that's it. i quit. you can't quit. this is not a game. how are we supposed to get to this ""internment centre,"" anyway? - by ship. - do we have a ship? - we'll get one. - we don't have a ship? i said, we'll get one! we'll find one. - where? - i don't know! it's a challenge. - liquidator brunt! - that's ex-liquidator brunt. thanks to quark, i'm no longer with the ferengi commerce authority. a child... ...a moron... ...a failure... ...and a psychopath. - quite a team you put together. - what do you want? i'm here to sign up. i'm going to help rescue your mother. - what? - how did you know about moogie? i know a lot of things. you think if you help save her the nagus will give you your job back. - when do we leave? - we're not leaving. not with you. - that's one thing we can all agree on. - nobody likes liquidators. - or even ex-liquidators. - the team has spoken. besides, there's a 20 bar reward to consider. better to split it five ways than six. fine. i'll just get in my ship and leave. - did you say ship? - that's right. why? now we are six. don't move! you're surrounded. don't shoot! i surrender! no, no, no! computer, freeze program. reset jem'hadar. - i think we're improving. - no. this is the eighth run-through. you haven't hit a single jem'hadar. and you shot moogie! i saw we were going to fail so i put her out of her misery. who invited him along? maybe we should start with something easier. - like what? - like ambushing a couple of bolians. you couldn't ambush a bolian if he was tied to a tree! that's enough! get out of here, all of you. you heard me... go. but, brother, don't you want to keep practising? we're wasting our time, rom. we couldn't get anywhere near moogie, let alone rescue her. i guess we're not cut out to be heroes after all. and to think, just a few short days ago i was sitting on top of the world. the king of squill. you should have been there, brother. it was a very delicate negotiation. but i took my time, picked my moment, and then went in for the kill. it was beautiful to behold. brother... i think we've been going about this the wrong way. we're not commandos, we're negotiators. we make deals. that's what we're good at. the dominion has something we want, so we need to find something they want... and then we make a trade! - that way, everyone goes home happy. - happy and alive. now, what do we have to trade? captain, i can't thank you enough for all your help. don't thank me. thank major kira. she convinced me to talk to starfleet for you. consider it payback, quark, for rescuing me from the dominion. breaking you out of a cell is one thing, what you're planning is more dangerous. every negotiation has its share of danger. if you say so. - i guess it's time to pick up my prisoner. - just don't turn your back on him. - he's not to be trusted. - neither am. excuse me. sorry. - this isn't a ship, it's a closet. - if you don't like it, leave. i'll go. that leaves more room for the rest of you. besides, this isn't a rescue anymore, it's a prisoner exchange. i don't know why quark needs us. because he doesn't trust the dominion. and neither do i. why would the dominion pick a deserted cardassian station to make the trade? they didn't pick it, quark did. i've been there. it's the same design as ds9 so we know the layout. well, you have nothing to worry about. you'll have plenty of places to run and hide. this is keevan. we're going to trade him for ishka. hi. i'm rom. - this is nog, that's brunt... - rom... he doesn't care. truer words have never been spoken. i advise you all to send final messages to your loved ones. - and make sure your wills are in order. - why? because the moment we leave, you sign your death warrants. now if you don't mind, i'm going to take a nap. - all clear! - are you sure? tricorder indicates no other life-forms. - all right. let's head for base camp. - ""base camp""? he means the infirmary. it's over there. come on. let's move it! well, what are you waiting for? two slips of latinum for the first man who makes it to the infirmary. - i mean ""base camp."" ” - you don't pay soldiers to do their duty. you do if they're ferengi. great! another closet. we've chosen this spot for a reason. for one thing, it's a confined area with only two ways in or out: this one, and that one over there. it's near the airlock for access to our ship. and it's on the promenade where the prisoner exchange will be. - don't touch that. - this medical equipment still works. - anything for an upset stomach? - what you need is a new backbone. hey! i'm a weapons dealer, not a soldier. - cousin! - shall we set up our defence perimeter? - good idea. how much will it cost me? - don't worry. no charge. starfleet has really corrupted you, hasn't it? start by getting external sensors back on line. i want to know when a dominion ship gets within ten million kilometres. i'll set up a transport jamming signal. that way, the dominion can't beam our prisoner away. we certainly wouldn't want that to happen, would we? you don't seem too happy at the prospect of rejoining your people. believe me, i have nothing to be happy about. vorta are meant to commit suicide when captured. i failed to follow that rather... harsh policy. so they'll execute you? after what is surely going to be a most unpleasant debriefing. sorry to hear that, but it's not my problem. all i want is moogie back. when the dominion is done with you, all you'll want is a quick death. take him next door and see he stays there. we'll post a guard. four-hour shifts. you heard him, move. perhaps you can clarify something. what's the most vulnerable part of a jem'hadar's body? all right. you have your orders. let's get to work. - my son the soldier. - they've ruined him. - what was that? - it's gaila! - where's the vorta? - i don't know. you were guarding him! - he must have gone while i was asleep. - who said you could sleep? i couldn't help it. i was tired. i hadn't had any rest. - the ship... - if keevan gets away, we're finished! going someplace? apparently not. i couldn't get the impulse engines on line. that's because i had rom disengage the induction matrix. then why bother chasing me? because sometimes my brother gets things wrong. all right. no harm done. we still have our prisoner. - what's that? - the alarm i set up. a dominion ship is approaching. - to the infirmary! - let's go! - now what? - someone turned the alarm off. maybe it went off by itself. - do you hear something? - someone's out there. one of us should go check to make sure. - i nominate quark. - me? i'll go. firing line take aim. - anybody there? - you could say that. - i wonder what they're doing out there. - i don't hear anything. - why are we hiding? - there are jem'hadar out there. of course they're out there. we asked them to come. he's right. everything's going according to plan. all you have to do, quark, is negotiate the exchange. - remember, be firm, strong. - but don't get them angry. good luck, brother. say ""hi"" to moogie for me. - what if it's a trap? - of course it's a trap. they're not here to negotiate. they're here to kill us all. - you think? - don't listen. - he's just trying to save his own neck. - i'm trying to save all our necks. ferengi, show yourself. - we're here to trade. - don't go out there. we must get back to the ship. our only hope is to escape. we're not going anywhere, not without moogie. right, uncle? right. - ferengi, i don't like to be kept waiting. - i'm coming. i'm coming! - and you two are coming with me. - i was afraid he was going to say that. rom... - moogie! - my boys. i knew you'd come. you look beautiful. my lobes haven't been this firm in over a century. - i guess that makes all this worthwhile. - don't you start with me, quark. what a touching and heartfelt reunion. i'm glad i was here to witness it. now, where's keevan? i wish to conclude this transaction. all in good time, but first, i need some assurances. what kind of assurances? well, for one thing, i don't want any jem'hadar on this station. that would leave me in a very vulnerable position. one vorta against six ferengi. if it makes you feel better, these two can stay. i feel safer already. - now, where's keevan? - hold on, i'm not done yet. then, you're going to tell your helmsman to head back to dominion territory, warp nine. - that would leave me stranded here. - for a few days. i see, and by the time they return you'll be long gone. that's the idea. on the other hand, we could storm the infirmary and kill you all. i like our plan better. attack us and keevan will be the first to die. keevan's fate has already been sealed. maybe, but before he dies, i'll bet you'll want to know what secrets he's revealed. he's got you there, yelgrun. your people have a reputation for cunning. i see that it's well-earned. perhaps one day the ferengi will take their place as valued members of the dominion. anything's possible. i will evacuate the jem'hadar at once. we can exchange the prisoners in half an hour. we'll be waiting. one more thing. how do we know that's moogie, not a changeling? i think that uniform is too tight on you, nog. it's cutting off circulation to your brain. sounds like moogie. only one way to find out. wait. this should be interesting. - yeah. that's blood all right. - i knew it was moogie. now let's see if you're a changeling. - that's no way to tell. - you're right. give me that knife. i don't think so. - family... you understand. - not really. i was cloned. no parents? that explains a lot. no parents, no sweetheart. no investment portfolio. and no patience. we'll meet back here in one half hour. don't be late. you heard him, quark. rom, i'm counting on you. remember... moogie loves you. you should have seen my brother. he was brilliant. in a half hour we'll have moogie back and we can all go home. home... to the torrential rains of ferenginar. you know what i miss most? the rotting vegetation. - yep. - and the dampness. oh, to stand once more in those rivers of muck. i only wish i could be there with you. i can't believe it, we're going to get the reward. - 50 bars of gold-pressed latinum. - 50 bars? you said the reward was 20. - that's what rom said. 20. - he said 50. - you said you didn't care about latinum. - i don't, i just don't like to be cheated. everyone calm down. - when my cousin is cheating me? - i'm not cheating anyone. - and the other 30 bars? - there are no other 30 bars, are there? - not really. - he's lying. they're in it together. - you won't get away with this, quark! - i risk my life, and for what? you've had this coming for a long time, cousin! i hate ferengi. you idiot. what will we do? we can't have a prisoner exchange without a prisoner. if they find out he's dead, they'll kill us. will you stop saying that? maybe, if we surrender, they won't hurt us. i have a better idea. let's sneak back to my ship and escape. it's a big station. if we hide, maybe they won't find us. no one's hiding and no one's escaping, and no one's surrendering. what's wrong with you? have you forgotten the battle of prexnak? who could forget the greatest battle in ferengi history? ten ferengi stood alone against 273 lytasians. as i recall, all ten ferengi were slaughtered. the point is, we ferengi are just as tough as anyone in the galaxy. and this is our chance to prove it... once and for all. quark's right. let's do it for ishka. let's do it for the grand nagus. let's do it for ferengis everywhere! let's do it for equal shares of 50 bars of gold-pressed latinum. it always comes down to profit with you people. - we're ferengi. - and that's why i love you! 50 bars it is... minus my usual finder's fee. well, there's no doubt about it. according to these readings, this man is dead. - thank you, dr nog. - i just wanted to be sure. i thought maybe we could revive him, but i guess not. - he's alive! - no, he isn't. it's the neural stimulator, it caused a reflex in his cerebellum. i never knew you studied medicine. i didn't, but if you think about it, medicine is like engineering. it's about keeping things running, fixing broken parts. are you thinking what i'm thinking? find me more neural stimulators! it's time. bring out your prisoner. - stall them, uncle. - i'll try. i've done as you asked. the jem'hadar are on their way back to dominion territory. - we are alone on the station. - wonderful. now bring out keevan and we can conclude our business. keevan. right. absolutely. - i'm waiting. - he'll be right out. but first... my brother has to run some sensor scans to make sure they have really left. that is unnecessary. the jem'hadar are gone. - now bring me keevan. - i will, in a few minutes. no, not in a few minutes. now! or maybe you've changed your mind and don't want her back. kill her. - no! - give them what they want, quark. - i intend to. - excellent. once my brother completes his scans. and i thought the breen were annoying. very well. five minutes. but i will not tolerate any more delays. - neither will i. - that goes for me, too. you see, we're all in agreement. um... one more thing. why am i not surprised? the prisoner exchange... i'd like it to take place outside airlock 3. what's wrong with the promenade? nothing, except my ship is docked at airlock 3. you understand. only too well. but i must say your lack of trust saddens me. ah, well... a sign of the times. - nog, you have five minutes. - all right. here we go. 7,500 lots of hypicate futures? the hypicate root is very versatile. it's used in medicines, diffractive optics and even some beauty supplies. here, feel how smooth my head is. cream of hypicate. i apply it twice a day. you see, a diversified portfolio can mean greater profits and healthier skin. fascinating. i'd love to hear more, but if your son doesn't show up soon i'm going to have to kill you. yelgrun! - you ready? - i've been ready for hours. on a count of three, we release our prisoners. agreed? agreed. one... .two... ...three. what have they done to him? straighten him out. - straighten him out. - i'm trying. stop them! - would you please turn him off? - i can't. the transceiver is jammed. quark, the grand nagus is going to be so proud of you. i know i am. moogie... - what do we do with this one? - we'll take him with us. a gift to starfleet. they gave us a vorta, we'll give them one. - ferengi... - i know, i know... you hate us. all right, you... get moving! this is the sloppiest, most amateurish operation i've ever seen. if you ever do something like this again... count me in. you'll be the first one i call. if i even think about doing something like this again, shoot me. so, brother, how does it feel to be a... hero? you tell me. it feels... good? you bet it does."
0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0," last time on ""star trek - deep space nine""... this is intolerable! we are caged up like animals! stop it! we meet at last. gifts? how thoughtful. you should be honoured. you're witnessing an historic moment. the birth of the alliance between the dominion and the breen. and now, the continuation... we will secure the prisoners below. they will share a cell. they may wish to physically comfort each other on the long trip back to cardassia. i find inter-species mating rituals fascinating to watch. interesting device. i am so sorry. where are my manners? let me introduce legate damar, leader of the cardassian union. - thot gor. - thot. the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? what did he say? he says you need to have your universal translator adjusted. i would have if i'd known we were meeting with the breen. it is a distinct pleasure to finally meet you. thanks. if our talks are as productive as our subspace communications, i'm sure we'll sign the treaty documents soon. - treaty? - we'll discuss it later. the alliance between the breens and the dominion will end this war that has torn this quadrant apart. with the breen at our side, the federation cannot stand against us. they'll be erased from the face of the galaxy. this is outrageous! - have you read this treaty? - parts of it. it refers to ""territorial concessions"" that cardassia will make to the breen. - it doesn't say what they are. - don't worry about that. it's all itemised in a secret protocol between the dominion and the breen. all you have to do is sign the document as the acknowledged leader of the cardassian union. - i want to see this protocol. - then it wouldn't be a secret. you expect me to agree to these territorial concessions? damar, you are missing the point. we need the breen to win this war. when it's over, there will be more than enough territories available to compensate cardassia for the loss of a few minor planets. there are no minor planets in the cardassian union. you should talk to thot gor. express your concerns. - he's very reasonable. - i don't trust him or his people. the founders shouldn't just give away cardassian territory! i'm sorry, i think i misunderstood you. were you implying cardassian territory doesn't belong to the founders? surely that isn't what you meant? no. of course not. good. i look forward to receiving the signed documents from you within the hour. is there something else? the klingons have attacked septimus lll. - i'm aware of that. - and they've landed 15 divisions. the cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. the septimus lll situation will be dealt with. we will not allow your brave soldiers to perish in vain. you have my word. septimus lll will fall within the week! the cardassian 11th order is a reserve unit. old men and walking wounded. - they have no chance. - you're right. enough about war with the dominion. i want to hear about the war at home. you just married that freighter captain, didn't you? yes. war has broken out, whether you know it, or not. a long, gruelling, intoxicating war. i remember the day my beloved sirella moved into my home. i had a pet ""targ. "" had him since i was a boy. a filthy, mangy beast, but in his bony breast beat the heart of a warrior. of course, sirella loathed him. to make a long story short, while she was supervising the unloading of her bags, sirella accidentally left the front door open. my faithful ""targ,"" ever ready to follow the call of the wild, tottered outside on his frail legs and disappeared into the forest. i never laid eyes on him again. lady sirella draws the first blood. you see my point. don't get me wrong. i would not trade sirella for all the ""targs"" on kronos. and during our marriage i've won more than my fair share of battles. but in the end, i know she will win the war. i'll keep that in mind. you ate all the milaberries. well, then, have solbor bring us more. and give him another chance to frown disapprovingly? the good ranjen doesn't much care for me, does he? you'd think he'd be pleased to see his kai so happy. are you happy, adami? more than i've ever been in my life. the prophets are smiling on us. they've not only brought us together, but they've given us a great task - the restoration of bajor. our world will be reborn. and you will be its leader. - a sacred responsibility. - yes. i pray i'll have the strength to do what the prophets are asking of me. i will be at your side. we won't fail them. but the restoration will not come without struggle. there will be those who will stand in our way. it is not allowed to interfere with the will of the prophets. even those who claim to speak in their name. the emissary. in your vision, the prophets said he'd faltered. i can only hope that he doesn't choose to oppose them. their love is strong, but so is their wrath. i hate to say it, but this is doing wonders for my back. - i doubt our captors intended that. - probably not. we must get back and warn starfleet about the breen. you're right. there's just a few problems. we're on a jem'hadar ship heading in the wrong direction, hanging upside down and... and what? i think i'm getting spacesick. well... welcome home, mrs sisko. thank you, mr sisko. how was your cargo run? interesting. it seems my bajoran crew members have decided that serving under the emissary's wife is a little different than serving under his girlfriend. i've known some of those people for ten years and suddenly they're asking me for advice about their children, their wives, their husbands, their spiritual relationship with the prophets. welcome to the club. which reminds me... every spring, the emissary holds a ceremony to bless the women who want to be mothers. what does this have to do with me? there's been a request made, several in fact, that the emissary's new wife perform the ceremony this year. - this week, actually. - no. kasidy. i've got to draw the line somewhere. i married you. i didn't convert. and i'm not going to start acting like i suddenly believe in the prophets. i don't want you to feel uncomfortable. good. then it's settled. i'm going to take a sonic shower. take your time. dinner won't be ready for another 15 minutes. and so... the battle begins. - let me try. - you lack the necessary strength. and your fingers are too fat. look out. - would you... - i've got it. quiet! - ow! - are you hurt? yes. you cut my finger and made me hit my head! it was an accident. how will a pin out of a bunk help us escape? if you stop interfering and allow me to remove the pin, i will show you. - let me look at your head. - no, thank you. the last time you touched me, things got out of control. i was seduced and betrayed. - seduced? i seduced you? - at least we agree on that. what? you desired a physical relationship with me from the start. it was obvious. you have the biggest ego i've known. that's quite a statement. should i be embarrassed that jadzia had a few lovers before you? a few? more than a few. it was dozens. hundreds. i don't think there was anyone aboard ds9 who wasn't her lover! let me take this opportunity to welcome you to cardassia prime. i trust you're being well treated so far? i've been looking over the information you supplied during your interrogation, and the results are a bit confusing, as mental probes so often are. i was wondering if you wouldn't mind sifting through the data and clarifying certain issues for us. - you can't be serious. - i'm always serious. if you don't do as i ask, i'll have to hand you over to legate damar, and you know how ruthless the cardassians can be. i must inform you that a cardassian tribunal will try you as war criminals. - what are the charges? - it is not necessary for you to know. you will be found guilty and executed. if you decide to join us in our search for a quick end to this miserable war, your sentence will be reduced to life imprisonment. why don't you convince the founders to surrender? you know, my dear, it would be such a shame for you to die without the good dr bashir knowing how you felt about him. wait! overconfidence. the hallmark of the weyouns. the founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. they'll make another copy of him. you should've killed me. there's only one damar. - i will keep that in mind. - i'm sure you will. consider his offer, klingon. you die in two days. pick that up and let's go. there you are. who are you? what do you mean? i mean, who are you, anjohl tennan? i want to know everything. about your family, your childhood... - it would bore you. - not at all. what might seem trivial to you matters a great deal to me. i need to know more about this guide the prophets have sent me. this simple farmer. this man who shares my bed. - we are of bajor. - we await the restoration. i am ready. i have met the guide. you need only tell me what to do. i give myself to the prophets in all things. - she does not understand. - she is fearful. there is no other path. she is the chosen one. she must embrace us. i will. i swear it! give me a chance. please. give us your allegiance, kai winn adami. restore us to our rightful place in the celestial temple. reject the false prophets. walk our path and embrace your own destiny. feel our love. the love of the ""pah-wraiths... "" no! no! what is it, adami? what's happened? they came to me. a vision. blessed be the prophets. no! they weren't the prophets. they were... they were what? the ""pah-wraiths. "" find solbor. have him go to the shrine and bring me the orb. i must bare my soul to the prophets and beg forgiveness. - are you sure that's wise? - go! bring me the orb! well, hello. i'm glad you find the death of my predecessor so amusing. you misjudge me. i miss him deeply. here. let's drink to weyoun seven. when will the prisoners be executed? when the trial is completed. legal protocol must be observed. when? the execution is scheduled for tomorrow. 1400 hours. - have they agreed to cooperate? - no. maybe you should talk to worf again. welcome to our command centre. of course. go right ahead. that database is classified. legate damar means our entire database is open to you. feel free to examine it at your leisure. - surely you don't mean that? - i'm quite sincere. our military operation should stay a secret. the decision was made by the founder herself. she decided your recommendations will be submitted to thot gor. he will pass it on to her. i will not! i trust that was simply an unguarded emotional outburst, so i will ignore it... this time. make plans to do exactly as the founder instructed, or you can schedule an execution for yourself. ready. - leave me! - oh, shut up! - you never listen. - look who's talking. - do you have to do that? - i do it every day. i know. but it seems morbid. - that implies she's not coming back. - i wasn't implying that. one day ezri's going to come walking through those doors again and this drink is going to be waiting for her when she does. in the meantime, you're just reminding us that she's missing. no one's forcing you to sit here. it was the badlands. - what? - what? you said something about the badlands. worf. if his escape pod hadn't drifted into the badlands, the defiant would've found him and ezri wouldn't have gone. i never thought i'd hear myself say this, but i wish the defiant had found that klingon oaf. we can't change what's happened, so let's just hope for the best. i was just starting to. starting to what? i don't know. but there was something about her, wasn't there? something that made me happy, anyway. she was this old soul and yet so young at heart and... i don't know what i'm saying. - where is he? - he'll be here any moment. he said certain security precautions had to be observed before the orb was allowed to leave the shrine. - may i ask what you're planning? - no, you may not. this is far beyond your ability to comprehend, anjohl. come in. the orb of prophecy. place it on the table and then go. how may i serve you? you are not required here, thank you. - there's nothing to fear. - of course not. i am the kai. the prophets will make everything clear to me. - something's wrong. - what? there's nothing. the prophets show me nothing. they won't speak to me. they have forsaken me... ...because i have been in communion with the evil ones. adami... i know this may be hard to hear, but you must listen. i've hidden something from you. i didn't come here by chance. i had a vision. the true gods of bajor came to me and asked me to serve them. - the true gods? - the ""pah-wraiths. "" - they led me to you. - no! - they care about bajor. - no! - they want to make bajor strong. - heretic! - listen to me! - get away! enough! the prophets have done nothing for you. during the occupation, they turned their backs and let our people suffer. let me go! you've sacrificed everything for them, and how have they rewarded you? they've appointed an alien emissary. they've rejected you at every turn. even now they won't speak to you. - solbor! - shh! listen to me, please. the ""pah-wraiths"" will give you everything you've ever dreamt of... the power, the adoration of the people. in spite of your protestations of humility, that's what you really want. admit it. stop pretending to be something you're not. take what they're offering you. get out! go. crawl back to your prophets. beg their forgiveness. live the rest of your life in sisko's shadow. i'll do anything you ask. you need only give the word. have you nothing to say to me? am i so offensive to your eyes that i don't exist for you any more? there must be something i can do to prove that i'm still worthy of your love. - go ahead. - this is kai winn. i need to speak with you. would you come to my quarters? of course. colonel kira to see you, eminence. come in, my child. please sit down. thank you for seeing me at such a late hour. what can i do for you? i have often sensed you don't approve of how i conduct myself as kai. that you believe i put my own political interests ahead of our people's spiritual wellbeing. i wish i could disagree with that assessment. i have strayed from the path the prophets have laid down for me. eminence... you don't know. you don't know. eminence. when you told me the prophets had spoken to you, i prayed that they would open your heart, that they would change you. i want to change. i'd do anything to earn their forgiveness. - i'm afraid it's too late. - it's never too late. - the worst of us can be redeemed. - how? i'm not a vedek, but it seems to me... ...that you have to set aside the things that led you astray - ambition, jealousy. yes. i have given in to the temptations of power. - turn away from temptation. - yes. give yourself over to the prophets. i'll do whatever it takes to make myself worthy in their eyes. everything will change once you step down as kai. you'll see. step down? i don't understand. why would i do that? bajor needs me. eminence, being in power is what led you on the wrong path. but i've resolved to change. don't you see? once i have regained the prophets' trust, i'll be better able to serve them if i remain kai. if the prophets wanted me to step down, surely they would've told me so. they don't always use words to make their wishes known. sometimes they speak to us by touching our hearts. but only you would know if they had done that. but bajor needs me. good night, eminence. oh, damar. there you are. i want you to hear this. thot gor had an observation about our forces along the romulan border. he thinks we haven't taken advantage of weaknesses in their defences. is that so? the romulan colony in the unroth system is ripe for attack. their long-range sensor array is being repaired... - septimus lll has fallen! - excuse me? septimus lll. an entire cardassian order has been wiped out! - 500,000 men! - oh, yes. a great tragedy. - you promised reinforcements! - i didn't. - i said it would be dealt with. - by letting the klingons kill them? if you will calm down and listen, i will explain. the sacrifice made by the eleventh order will not be in vain. they forced the klingons to commit valuable troops and resources to capture a strategically worthless planet. - i'm glad you agree. - i don't! you condemned loyal cardassians... if they were loyal, they died willingly for the dominion. that's a great sacrifice. how many more sacrifices will my people make? your people, damar? we are all one with the dominion. vorta, cardassia, jem'hadar, the breen... we all serve the founders and we will all make whatever sacrifices they deem necessary. thot gor, could you reiterate your plan? i seem to have lost my train of thought. i know. it's become difficult to get a full day's work out of him. the dax symbiont has lived for over 300 years. experienced eight lifetimes. and now it's all going to end with an execution on cardassia. ezri tigan's contribution to the dax legacy will be to end it. there is no honour in self-pity. worf, i have had just about enough of your little klingon aphorisms. i came on this mission to save your miserable life, so the least you can do is stop acting like a self-righteous ""targ. "" your motives for rescuing me were not honourable. do you really think i disobeyed orders and risked my life to seduce you? i hate to burst your bubble, worf, but it wasn't that good. always the barb, always the joke. there was a time when you found my sense of humour endearing. that was jadzia. not you. are you angry at me for something i did or because i'm not jadzia? let's cut to the heart of the matter. do you love me? me? ezri? you are trying to make this about me. answer the question. do you love me? i made my feelings clear back on goralis lll. what is it, worf? could it be that you're feeling just a little guilty? because you don't have the same feelings for me that you had for jadzia? if that's true, maybe we both made a mistake back on goralis. so maybe we both should be forgiven. this night would be better spent preparing ourselves for the next life instead of rehashing the mistakes of this one. you are right. what? i said you are right. i do not love you as i loved jadzia. there's no crime in that. i dishonoured myself. i know how often i use that word. maybe too often. - but in this case, it is appropriate. - go on. from the moment you came on the station, i knew you were not jadzia. and yet i knew there was a part of jadzia still alive within you. on goralis, i allowed myself to see her instead of you. i felt the same way. a part of me, the part that was your wife, wanted very much to be close to you. i realise jadzia saw physical love differently than i do. to her it could mean many things, but to me it was a deeply spiritual act. when i made love to you, my motives were not spiritual. it was an unworthy impulse. worf, we're not gods or prophets. we're people. we make mistakes. there is one other thing i want you to know. i honestly didn't realise how i felt about julian. i'd never hide something like that from you. i believe you. and i do not hold any malice toward you or dr bashir. that's good to know. friends? - and more. - and more. it appears all we have left to do is to be executed. sounds like a lazy day. it's time. there's a cardassian patrol ship in launch bay 3a, two levels above. its computers have information to get you past our checkpoints. - why are you doing this? - give a message to the federation. - they have an ally on cardassia. - why should we trust you? you can trust me or you can stay here and be executed. i vote for option one. escaped? how could this have happened? you put the jem'hadar in charge of the detention area. thank you for reminding me. no, i assure you this is not typical of our security procedures. the founder wishes to see me. she has to be told about this. i'm sure she'll understand. if not, i look forward to meeting weyoun nine. eminence, anjohl is here. he claims you called for him. - show him in. - as you wish. i remember when i first saw the gate of the celestial temple. i was on the promenade. when it burst into view, this whirlpool of colour and light, the people around me were in awe. they said they could feel the prophets' love washing over them. do you know what i felt, anjohl? nothing. absolutely nothing. but i smiled and pretended i did because it was expected of me. - i've never admitted that to anyone. - i can understand why. they've never spoken to me. never offered me guidance. never trusted me with the fruits of their wisdom. now i'm supposed to step down as kai in order to be blessed by them? no. i have worked too hard, waited too long to give it all up now. you shouldn't have to. merciful gods don't ask their children to make such sacrifices. the prophets have turned their backs on me after all i've done, all the pain i've endured for them. they are not worthy of you, adami. i'm a patient woman. but i have run out of patience. i will no longer serve gods who give me nothing in return. i'm ready to walk the path the ""pah-wraiths"" have laid out for me. i'll walk with you. and no one will be able to stand against us. those who dare to try - the federation and its vedek puppets, the false gods and their precious emissary - they'll all be swept aside like dead leaves before an angry wind."
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"mm. delicious, sir. - terrific as always, dad. - i'm glad you like it. if i may say so, this sauce tastes very familiar. it should. it's puree of tube grubs. eugh! tube grubs! if nog is willing to eat squid, it's only fair that we try tube grubs. - you said it was terrific. - before i knew what it was. eat. you need more meat on your bones. nog, how do you like working security? - it's very interesting, sir. - that's not what you told me. - something wrong? - no, sir. everything's quite satisfactory. thank you, sir. could've fooled me. cadet, if there's a problem, i want to hear about it. - well, sir... it's the klingons, sir. - what about them? - it's their attitude, sir. it's bad. - bad? they're loud, obnoxious and, if i may say so, generally intoxicated. whenever a station security officer tries to talk to them, to ask them to keep the noise level down, they ignore him. you mean they ignore you. they never look me in the eye when i talk to them. they just stare over my head and pretend i'm not there. i hate when they do that. i can see how that might be annoying. not as annoying as listening to him complain. here's what i suggest. the next time they refuse to acknowledge your presence, do what a klingon would do. confront them about it. - you'll earn their respect. - or get your butt kicked. either way, they'll never ignore you again. enter. captain, i need to speak with you. alone. that does it! - not now, nog. - come on, nog. let's go. my crew and i were patrolling the cardassian border. - we intercepted a disturbing message. - this is a maquis code. i thought the maquis were wiped out by cardassia and their dominion allies, but it would appear i was mistaken. were you able to decode it? michael, i hope you get this message. we've launched the missiles. they'll reach cardassia in 13 days. it may not bring back our dead, but they'll have a lot of company. - did you detect any missiles? - no. but that proves nothing. a few months ago, the klingon high council decided to aid the maquis in their fight against cardassia. we provided them with 30 class-iv cloaking devices to use on their ships. but they could've been mounted on the missiles. you see the problem. the maquis had access to tricobalt explosives, biogenic weapons, antimatter warheads... the death toll could be in the millions. i knew the maquis were desperate, but i didn't believe they'd do something like this. a sabre bear is most deadly when it is trapped. cardassia is under dominion protection. if millions are killed by human terrorists, they'll demand revenge. and their dominion allies will see that they get it. they'll launch a counterstrike against the federation, the klingon empire and the entire alpha quadrant. and start a war that could destroy us all. - report. - needle in a haystack. we spent 50 hours searching the badlands for signs of the missiles. we had a hard time avoiding the jem'hadar patrols. they homed in on your plasma wake? they were still able to track us. the defiant's engines are too powerful. they ionise the nebula gasses. it's like a ligorian mastodon moving through the forest: you may not be able to see it, but it makes the leaves rustle. i need answers. if the missiles exist, they're 11 days from their target. i need to know where they are and how to stop them. we need more information, a way to narrow our search. i think i know someone who can help. eddington, wake up. i'm dreaming, right? this is a nightmare. this is a nightmare, all right, but you are wide awake. i was wondering when you'd show up. - i expected you weeks ago. - i've been busy. but now you're here, so enjoy yourself. savour the moment. you've wanted to gloat over my defeat for a long time. i'm not here to gloat. you deserve to. you won. i betrayed starfleet by joining the maquis. you swore you'd track me down and you did. you got your revenge. actually, that's what i'm here to talk about: revenge. one of my favourite topics. i believe that was intended for you. michael, i hope you get this message. we've launched the missiles. they should reach carda... don't you want to hear the rest of it? why should i? it has nothing to do with me. - michael is a very common name. - true. but somehow i think you're the right one. guess again. if those missiles hit cardassia, it could start a war. billions of people will be killed. if you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. i used up all my tears when the dominion slaughtered the maquis. i sat in this cell for three days listening to the reports. in those three days, everyone and everything i cared about was wiped out. i heard the same reports. it was a tragedy. your generosity of spirit touches me. but you don't give a damn about what happened to us and i don't give a damn about what happens to you. you've taken off the uniform, but you're still a starfleet officer. you don't want a war between the federation and the dominion. what you want and what i want doesn't matter. you can't stop those missiles from hitting their targets. they're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, change course at random. you'll never find them. maybe we can't locate them, but that doesn't mean we can't stop them. you must have programmed in an abort code, a way to deactivate them. even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. i don't think you're going to find that, either. no code, no launch site. i'm afraid you're out of luck, captain. looks like everyone's out of luck. that's it? you're just going to lie there and do nothing. that's what you do when you're in prison. nothing. just wait for the next counselling session, the next rehabilitation seminar. what if i could arrange a pardon in exchange for your helping me? you like this, don't you, ben? deciding the fate of others makes you feel important. it's not about me. do you want your freedom or not? - if they released me, what would i do? - anything you want. what about bringing the maquis back from the dead? can i do that? can you? can anyone? no. i didn't think so. in that case, i'll tell you what i want. i want to lie here until the jem'hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. ah! careful. that hurts. - i haven't done anything yet. - what are you waiting for? - you'll survive. - did you catch him? major kira caught him. i was in the bajoran shrine and he burst in, stark naked, fell to his knees crying out to the prophets. morn. who would've thought he'd just snap like that? not me, which makes me wonder what could've pushed him over the edge. why are you looking at me? i'm the victim here. - he hit me with a barstool. - why did he hit you? - i don't have the faintest idea. - think harder. you were talking to him right up to when he went berserk. of course. that's what bartenders are supposed to do: talk to their customers. what were you talking to him about? all i said was that the military personnel on this station were starting to look a little nervous. when they get nervous, i get nervous. that's all you said? basically. i might have done a little harmless theorising. about what? something like... it was only a matter of time before the dominion launched an assault against the federation and the station would undoubtedly be their first target. and i might have idly suggested that there wasn't a chance in hell of getting out of here alive. then morn hit you and ran out screaming, ""we're all doomed"". some people just don't react well to stress. 'ops to major kira. incoming transmission from captain sisko.' probably wants to tell us that the first wave of jem'hadar is on the way. ha, ha, ha. very funny. - she's joking, right? - hold still. i plan to go into the badlands and deactivate the missiles. you sure you don't want me to send the defiant? it would attract attention. i'd feel better if you weren't out there alone. don't worry, major. i'm not alone. - dinner. - what about these? what about them? - it makes it difficult to eat. - you'll manage. replicator, entrée 103. curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. at least that's what they want us to believe. but we both know what we're eating. replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. it's not that bad. it looks like chicken but it tastes like protein molecules. you don't want it? don't eat it. remember that thanksgiving dinner you cooked? how many months did it take to grow those vegetables? every ingredient fresh, real. though you used too much tarragon. i wasn't aware that you were a food critic. i wasn't. until i joined the maquis and started eating real food. fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. and tomatoes. do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? there's always too much rain, it's too hot, it's too cold. i wonder what happened to those tomato plants? probably burned to the ground along with everything else. if we don't stop those missiles, a lot of things will burn to the ground. you never give up. we're having a pleasant conversation about food and you're thinking about the mission and getting me to co-operate. you're wasting your breath. my life is over. i'm dead. for a dead man, you talk a lot. then why didn't you leave me in prison? because i have a job to do and i can't do it without you. i told you when you dragged me out that i wasn't going to help you. - i meant it then and i mean it now. - i am trying to prevent a war. you set the ground rules when you came after me, ben. you made it personal. you could have left the maquis alone, but you didn't do it. you hunted us, fought us every chance you got. in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. i expected better of you than that. so did a lot of people. people like cal hudson. - you haven't heard that in a while. - you're right. - you were friends at the academy. - and a long time after. - until he joined the maquis. - he betrayed his starfleet oath. if it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. he was killed in a skirmish with the cardassians. - he was a good man. - he felt the same about you. he thought you were wrong about the maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. you can't forgive any of us, not because we betrayed starfleet, but because we betrayed you. that's what this is all about: your ego. where benjamin leads, all must follow. is that what you believe? the maquis were never a threat to the federation, but we were a threat to you and you couldn't have that, not when you were measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. you want to blame me for what happened to the maquis? fine. blame me. blame starfleet. blame everyone except michael eddington. the maquis won great victories under my leadership. your shining moment of glory. michael eddington gets to play hero. you always wanted to lead troops in a glorious cause. you had your chance and you led them right into their graves. they died because i was in jail when they needed me most. they died because you filled their heads with false hopes when what they needed was a negotiated peace. - the cardassians were on the run. - right into the arms of the dominion. - end of story. - not quite the end. a few survivors of your crusade have launched a pointless strike against cardassia. it's not so pointless. sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. you want to be remembered for bringing about the worst war in federation history? not the legacy i had in mind, but i can live with it. can you? you can do better than that. you're barely making contact. again! more wine! - that's got to hurt. - they're at 65 decibels. - loud, but not loud enough. - what are you talking about? five more decibels and they'll be disturbing the peace. - then i'm escorting them to a cell. - you're going to arrest martok? i am. - aren't you going to call for backup? - you heard your father. they won't respect me until i stand up to them... alone. i think respect is overrated. that's it. 70 decibels. they're mine. - you ok? - i'm fine. - just tell me when everyone leaves. - why? because i'm not getting up until they do. eddington. - are we there yet? - where? that's the question, isn't it? - there's something i want you to see. - i'll pass, thanks. suit yourself. maybe it's nothing. it is hard to get an accurate reading in the badlands, but unless i'm mistaken, two jem'hadar warships are headed our way. those are jem'hadar warships, all right. - you've got a problem. - we both do. they're coming closer. one au away. point nine au. you wanted to be blown to pieces by the jem'hadar? it looks like you're going to get your wish. i have faith in you, captain. you'll get us out of this. not me, mr eddington. i don't know the badlands that well, but you do. - where are you going? - to get a raktajino. throat's a little dry. one raktajino. you're crazy. they're almost on top of us. these replicators sure know how to make klingon coffee. - they're scanning us. - they'll be in firing range soon. very clever, captain. but i am not going to take the helm. suit yourself. that is what you're trying to do, isn't it? i'm trying to see how serious your death wish really is. i bet that it doesn't exist, just like i bet that you won't let your friends start a war that could destroy the alpha quadrant. - that's a big bet. - i don't think so. point seven au. can you lose them? a spiral course around a plasma filament should dissipate our signature. you can take over now. no. i don't think so. i'll get you to the launch site and help you deactivate those missiles. but then you and i are going to have it out. - you want a fight? i will give you one. - i don't intend to fight you. i intend to kill you. when i joined the maquis, i left some personal items on the station. as far as i know, all your things were put in storage. you didn't see an old earth coin about this big with a bird on the front? a loon. my lucky loonie. it's an old canadian coin. been in the family for over 200 years. it's probably in a locker in the assay office with the rest of your things. i hope so. i'd hate to think i'd lost it. speaking of things you'd lost... there's no way they could have tracked us. - can we lose them again? - dissipating our signature didn't work. - the maquis didn't have plan ""b""? - you're not going to like it. half an au. if you have a plan, i guarantee i'll learn to love it. - we have to realign the flow regulators. - you mean shut down the engines? who said that? realign the emitter with the engines engaged? the flow regulators could blow up in your face. in your face. i'll be piloting the ship. we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field. even if the jem'hadar survive the blast, it should wipe out our ion wake. point four au and closing. you'd better get started. all right, but hold the ship steady. i don't want any accidents. - i'll do my best. - hm. 'warning: attempting to access flow regulators 'with engines engaged is not recommended.' tell me something i don't know. disengage safeties. authorisation sisko a471. 'acknowledged. 'safeties disengaged.' i told you to hold the ship steady. we ran into a pocket of boron gas. don't do it again. - ""you still there, captain?' - disappointed? 'just checking.' things are going to get unpleasant if we don't get out of here. i'm aware of the problem. - eddington! - they're firing at us. in that case... let her rip! that got the adrenaline pumping. no sign of the jem'hadar. looks like we lost them, captain. captain? - computer, locate captain sisko. - 'internal sensors are off-line.' i told you to keep the ship steady! you're alive. what a pleasant surprise. now get us to the launch site! the next time you know i have a girl over, call me before you come home. - you were only talking. - you never know. i know your track record. you never get past talking. - that's a scurrilous lie. - is that worse than a regular lie? - check before you come home, ok? - and you do the same. you haven't had a date since you left the academy. now who's being scurrilous? i don't believe this. they're loitering on the promenade in our old spot. they know a good view when they see one. they know i'm territorial about that spot. they're insulting me. you are getting stranger as you get older. i can't let them do this to me. stay back, jake. this could get ugly. all right, it's time for you to move along. we will decide when it is time to move. regulation 82/7-b states loitering is prohibited on the promenade. - is that so? - it is! either move or i'm going to have to place you under arrest. you are either very brave... or very stupid, ferengi. probably a little of both. indeed. courage comes in all sizes. but don't tempt fate. nog, i'm impressed. klingons... you just have to know how to handle them. next stop athos iv, a grim fogbound rock in the middle of nowhere. what better place to hide a launch site? we thought so. - the sensors aren't detecting anything. - that's the general idea. there's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. we won't get a transporter through all that static. there's a shuttle pad near the launch site. then take us down. - how far? - a few kilometres. - these tunnels are man-made. - i know. i helped dig them. now where? give me a minute to get my bearings. you hear something? the barrels are made of duridium. that should hold them for a while. you said the jem'hadar would never find this place. i was wrong. let's rush them. in this fog, they might hit each other. - too risky. - the maquis never had that attitude. if you get killed, there will be no way to stop those missiles. i'll try to draw their fire. catch them off guard when they come after me. - how will i know what i'm aiming at? - i'll be holding the pipe. attacking with a pipe. that's a brilliant plan. - it could be worse. - it could be me holding the pipe. - you have sharp eyes. - not really. i saw who was knocked down and shot the one standing. - thanks for the vote of confidence. - help me drag the bodies to the well. that way the other jem'hadar will look for their friends and not us. this place will soon be crawling with jem'hadar. - get us to the launch site now. - that way. - are you sure? - reasonably. - we're close. - then let's keep moving. wait. - vance! - you knew him? - he was a shuttle pilot. and a friend. - there are more. this wasn't supposed to happen. we were winning. the cardassian empire was falling into chaos. the maquis colonies were going to declare themselves independent. listen to me. - this is not the time. - it's over. it's not. we still have to stop those missiles. that's all you care about? the missiles? if we don't stop the missiles, this'll just be the beginning. i was their leader. i was responsible for them and i failed. - i failed them all. - maybe we all failed them. maybe we could have prevented this. it's going to take a lot of soul-searching before i find the answer, but right now we have a mission to complete. i wish i knew that killing you would make me feel better, but i suppose i can wait for another time. - that's it. - are you sure? you want to argue about it? come on. it looks clear. i'm glad one of us remembered they could do that. wait. i don't want to damage any of the equipment. michael. i wondered when you'd get here. i came as soon as i could. captain sisko, i'd like you to meet rebecca sullivan, my wife. we've got a runabout at the landing site. we can still access the tunnels through the old well. try not to lose each other in the fog. what about disarming the missiles? - does this look like a launch site? - i want the truth now. there were no missiles, no strike against cardassia. it was a way to let michael know that we'd made it here. this was our fallback position. i needed you to evacuate these people. what if i hadn't forced you to come with me? i would have volunteered. you should be smiling, ben. that dominion counterstrike you were so worried about... - it's not going to happen. - yes, you're right. that is good news. but i still don't like being lied to. i hope you're ready to finish what you started. - we don't have time for this. - we'll finish this later. you heard what michael said. stick together. if i had known the jem'hadar were going to be here, - i would have brought more men. - they shouldn't be here. no one knew about this base but us. they landed three days ago. we tried to fight... i saw the bodies. i didn't think i'd make it, but they kept the leaders alive. they were going to make a present of us to cardassia. now we'll end up in a federation prison. we're not going to prison. concentrate on getting off this planet. we can worry about the rest later. you're not putting us in prison this time. - you never give up, do you? - never. move! go! don't stop until you get to the runabout. - you, too. - i'm staying with you. i'll be right behind you. now get going. - i didn't know you were married. - two weeks before you captured me. not much of a honeymoon. - i suggest we fall back now. - you'll get no argument from me. go! you'd better get to the runabout. get rebecca and the others to safety. - i'm not going to let you just... - go! you are one stubborn, headstrong... i told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. - where's michael? - he's not coming. rebecca... we have to go, now. crenshaw, yuen, circle around to the left. stiles, dimitris, watch our right flank. seems like a perfect time for a song. wish i could think of one. does anyone know a good song? something rousing? too bad. rebecca... major. - my earring clip. where was it? - maintenance conduit 33-a. i guess it fell off when you were doing the inspection. you must have searched everywhere. just doing my job. glad to be of help. - cadet. - general. - now that's better. - what was that all about? respect. he was a complicated man. if you ask me, eddington couldn't have picked a better way to go, at least from his point of view. he was a romantic and what is more romantic than a glorious death in defence of a lost cause? he died fighting for what he believed in. i called him a traitor once, but in a way he was the most loyal man i ever met. he was a maquis, right up to the bitter end. is that what this is? the end of the maquis? who knows? there could still be more of them out there, hiding from the dominion, biding their time. you almost sound hopeful. there is something attractive about a lost cause. maybe you have more in common with eddington than you want to admit. maybe. goodnight, benjamin. get some rest. english"
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"good evening, fellow motorists. the road signs became so dense that i had to abandon my automobile and proceed on foot. i do hope the time never comes when billboard will obscure this lovely scenery. actually, i believe these are seedling signs. this is where the highway department grows them. you are probably more familiar with the wild variety that springs up along the roadside. tonight's play has a connection, however tenuous, with the foregoing. in it, you will see an automobile. the play is called ""dead weight"" and will begin after this one-minute detour. slow, man. make it slow. now put your hands out. easy. that's right. what do you want? okay, lvy league. now open the door, smooth and easy. that's right. now you slide out, nice and easy like, before... now, listen... i said move. and i mean right now. now face the car. i said face it! now. put your hands out, lean on it. okay, baby. now you slide out. now look... shut up, man of distinction. now, put your hands back there. come on. now, doll. you slide out and bring the keys with you. hey, baby, i said bring the keys. oh, oh, cool, smooth hands. yeah, that's nice. but that's for later, honey... if you've got any ideas about... i got lots of ideas, man. i'm crawling with 'em. hey, you're pretty well-heeled, chum. courtney n. masterson. wow, what a square name. hey, what's the ""n"" stand for, courtney? none of your business. i asked you a question, mister. now, look, you've got what you've wanted, why don't you let us alone? now, i asked you what that 'n' stands for, courtney. nesbitt. courtney nesbitt masterson. wow, dad. like they didn't want to give you any first names just last ones. why's that? very well, courtney. here's your keys. i'd like my wallet, too. you can keep the money. but there are some papers in it that are worthless to you. forget it, dad. it's not over yet. oh, please, let us go. cool it, baby. now you open the trunk. there's nothing in the... i said open it! all right. take all that junk out and toss it on the ground. now what? now you get in, cat. oh, please, i have some money, too. it's in my purse in the car. you just take that and we'll say nothing. ain't that nice? but i'm not after your bread, baby. what do you mean? i mean, i'm coming to you. but first we gotta tuck in little ol' courtney nesbitt masterson. you dig how it is? now, you get up. you get up slow, dad, or i'm going to slice you pretty. all right, sonny boy. if you think that knife's faster than this gun of yours, slice away. you all right, peg? yes. come on! now, look, mister... now you lean against the car. nice and easy, man. now. get in the trunk. hey, now, look, i never woulda gone through with it. i mean, really. i was only kiddin', that's all. a great kidder, you are. you would have killed me if you could. get in the trunk! in the trunk! you make me get in here, i'm not gonna forget it, courtney. in the trunk. there's nothing to be afraid of now. oh! oh, court. stop it. i really thought he was going to... stop thinking about it. let's get away from here. right away. now, what are we going to do? we're going to drop our little friend off at a police station. will it be in all the papers? i can just see the headline now, ""advertising executive captures lovers lane bandit."" great piece of publicity. you're right. it'll make great reading, except, of course, to your wife. you better have that rear tire checked. well, why didn't you tell him? i don't know what to do. you knew what to do before you thought about your wife. that's what's really bothering you, isn't it? what if it is? same old, courtney, aren't you? always cautious, safe, and respectable. you'll never change. ""oh, carol, honey, i just happened to run into an old friend at the ad club ""after work and we were just cutting up a few touches when..."" cut it out, peg. i know that's the way it happened, but... she'll find out i've been in town for 10 days, darling. she won't believe this is the first time you've seen me. i told her i was going to work late at the office on the new account. i was, too. after i had dinner at the club. how was i to know i was going to see you there? maybe i could just give him a big scare and let him go? he'd know there was something fishy if you did that. he knows my name, too. did you see the way he looked at me when he got in the trunk? he won't forget i made him do that. you should have killed him back there. killed him? peg, think what you're saying. yes, you... you could have said that you were just out there alone. that you stopped there to... you know, to think out some business problems. who'd buy that? a man parked up there alone. what's so wrong with that? well, it just isn't practical, that's all. the police have all sorts of ways of checking things, like the tire marks... peg. what? do you realize we've been driving along seriously discussing murder? i'd say it was more killing in self-defense. but a man's life. he's not a man, he's a beast. i'm not leaving until you tell me what you're going to do. i don't know yet. but you've got to do something. i realize that. suppose... suppose it never happened? but it did! no, you don't know what i mean. we met at the club at dinner, just as we did. then we went to my office and discussed the dixon affair. well, that's logical, i guess. then i brought you directly here, at half past one. i don't think anybody will ask anything about it, but if they do, nothing happened. think you can bluff that through. i can try. oh, court! i didn't mean to cause you any trouble. wasn't your fault. i was stupid. drive up there and start behaving like a sophomore. i liked it. so did i. i was surprised. surprised? surprised that i felt this way after such a long time. oh, i'm glad. court, what do you intend to do about him? i don't know. whatever it is, it won't involve you. good night. good night. get out. okay. okay. easy now. just take it easy. hey, look. now, please. please, mr. masterson, if you'd just forget about it, i'd never do it again. i wish i could believe that. oh, you can, honest. and you wouldn't be sorry, either. i mean, i'd play it cool from now on, really. well, we talked it over, and we decided... where is she? the chick, i mean. um, peg. that's her name, isn't it? that's no concern of yours. you know, if you let me go, you wouldn't have to answer any questions. so that would be nice, wouldn't it. i mean, the cops can ask some pretty embarrassing questions. listen, i'm trying to give you a break, i'm trying to be nice to you. don't make me laugh. man, i'm gonna flip. you don't want them cops around here any more than i do. now, suppose we just knock off all this bull and i get out of here. and from here on out, i don't know you and you don't know me. for how long? you know? that's an interesting question. i hadn't even thought about it. you would have. yeah, you're right, courtney. you wanna know something? i think you're in worse trouble than me. so you and i, we'll just forget about it, for a while. but i'll be seeing you. hmm? so long, pop. wait a minute. don't you want this? oh, oh, yeah. thanks, courtney. i forgot... are you in the habit of picking up hitchhikers, mr. masterson? no, not as a rule. then why did you pick this boy up? it was, as you say, after 01:30 in the morning. wouldn't you say that was a dangerous thing to do? i know it was, now. i didn't think then. where did you think he was going? up the canyon road, somewhere. i remember thinking at the time how unpleasant it would be to have to walk for any distance up that road at that time of night. look, i'm trying to tell you what happened. i'm trying to cooperate, but... but what, mr. masterson? well, your questions, they... they what? am i on trial or something? should you be? of course not. i admit i killed the boy, but it was him or me. he told me he was going to kill me. i made a grab for the gun, there was a fight and the gun went off. outside the car. i told you it was outside the car. he made me get out. he made me put my hands against the car and lean on it. he must have seen it in the movies or something. lieutenant ward. yeah. uh-huh. no, that's fine. all right. no, you can bring the car in now. but we'll keep it a day or two. yeah. all right. your story checks insofar as the time of death of the boy is concerned. you mean, there are other parts of the story that don't check? is there any reason why the rest of your story shouldn't check, mr. masterson? none whatever. the boy you killed was named rudy stickney. he has been in and out of trouble since he was 12. he did time a year ago for armed robbery. he liked guns. you're a lucky man, mr. masterson. lucky he didn't kill you. i'm sorry if we've seemed to be unnecessarily rough on you, but we had to make sure all the pieces fit. i understand. as it is, you probably saved the state a lot of money. i'm sure that in the end the result would have been the same, but at the tax-payers' expense. personally, i think there is nothing lower than a punk kid who takes advantage of a kindness. uh, need i warn you about picking up hitchhikers in the future? no. i've learned my lesson, i really have. am i, uh, free to go now? yes, we have your car. as i said on the phone, we'd like to keep it a day or two, if you don't mind. sergeant phillips will see that you get home in a squad car. we'll be in touch with you in a few days, mr. masterson. thank you. thank you, officer. i've been so worried about you, courtney. after your call i just couldn't go back to bed. it's nothing to worry about. everything's under control. court? court? why didn't you want me down there with you? well, there was no need. did you really kill a man? yes. only it was a boy, a young hoodlum. i picked him up. he threatened to kill me. he had a gun. it must have been horrible out there on that mountain road. all alone. can i get you something to eat? no, thanks. i'll just have a drink. what i really need is some sleep. you poor dear. you must be exhausted. weren't you frightened? i'd have been scared to death. yes, i was frightened. want to tell me about it? i had dinner at the ad club. then i went to the office and worked on the dixon pitch... oh, mr. masterson. good morning, rita. we didn't know you'd be in after what happened. well, there was a moment there when i thought i might never be in. oh, good morning, mr. masterson. good morning, mary. mr. callahan, and mr. ivy send their congratulations. and they want to see you, when you have a moment. thank you. and i want to add my congratulations to it. it must have been really something. it was, mary. it was. oh, mr. masterson! there's a man waiting for you in my office. a detective. send him in. go in, please. thank you. mr. masterson, i'm lester eldridge. my secretary says you're from the police. i suppose you want to talk about last night. uh, yes, there are some details to be cleared up. well, i told your boys all i know. they know as much about it as i do. i told your secretary i was a detective, and i am. she assumed i was a police detective. it was an assumption i let her retain. actually, i retired from the force two years ago to go into the private end of the business. for the past five days, i've been working on a routine case for a suspicious wife. it was routine until last night. you weren't out of my sight for two minutes last night, mr. masterson. you know, i thought before i made a report to your wife, or the police, it would be mutually profitable if you and i discussed it first. private enterprise should be encouraged. but i think mr. eldridge was carrying it a bit far. there was one further development, however. it seems that mr. eldridge also had a suspicious wife. and he too had been followed the preceding night. if you don't follow that, perhaps you'll be interested in the following, which is what i shall follow. i have just been surprised by a policeman who was lurking in the underbrush. he gave me a ticket for reckless driving, parking overtime, speeding, and jay walking. however, he agreed to tear up the ticket if i would show him how to get out of here. next week, i shall return with another story. until then, good night."
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"that's precisely why i don't care for russian roulette. i never seem to win. there are two revolvers such as this... which play a part in tonight's story. it is what you might call a western, although there isn't a horse to be seen. we intended to get horses, but they couldn't remember the lines. so you'll be seeing people instead. the cast is a very small one... and threatens to become smaller with every passing moment. you see, two of the characters have threatened to eliminate each other on sight. now, i am sure there are some of you who don't want to see them do that. so i suggest instead that you listen to our sponsor's message. more coffee, ben? no, thanks. let me tell you, maggie, them hotcakes of yours just melt in a fellow's mouth. i'll be danged if i don't feel like another stack. maggie. look, ben, you get your chores done... and then i'll cook you a steak for lunch. well... with hash brown potatoes. and apple pie for dessert. you're right, maggie. another stack of them cakes might ruin my appetite for lunch. the fire's low. you better bring in some wood from the shed, ben. you going to keep that stove burning all day? of course. sort of silly. ain't gonna have no customers today. maggie, a fellow would be plumb loco... to travel the crossroads in this storm. now, ben, don't tell me that you couldn't find the shed in all that rain. you going to leave the door open, del? you alone here, maggie? no customers. mind if i warm up? now that's a silly question. take off your slicker and sit down. much obliged. haven't seen you in a long time, del. you on your way to copper city? maybe. i ain't decided yet. you must be hungry. get yourself comfortable, and i'll fix you some breakfast. i'm comfortable, maggie. don't you even want to take your gun belt off? i'm comfortable. what'll it be? hotcakes, ham and eggs, steak? you name it. makes no difference. whatever you got handy. hey! i'm sorry. well, be more than sorry. you go and help him pick it up. sorry, ben. it's all right, del. only you scared me, coming in here, seeing a gun aimed right at me. you're almost out of kerosene. if you're going to keep them lamps burning all day, you'll run out before night. oh, no. better ride back to town and get some more. i hate to ask you, ben. don't mind. long as you don't forget about that steak and apple pie. i'll fix it for you as soon as you get back. mighty fine. ben. yeah. i'd be obliged if you'd do favor for me. sure thing. when you go back into town, don't mention that you've seen me out here. it's all right, ben. all right, i won't mention it. sit down, del, and i'll start your breakfast. thanks, maggie. thanks for not asking a lot of questions. well, you stopped here to eat. where you been and where you're going ain't my concern. you're a mighty fine gal, mag. save your blarney for the town women. no, i mean it. here you are, stuck out at the crossroads all alone, fixing food for saddle tramps. good food. you got a lot of friends. i got a good business here. i get all kinds of trade. i get them coming... and i get them running. you figure i'm running? not hard. but any time a man won't take off his gun belt to eat a meal... he's got a pretty good reason. and the reason usually is that he thinks he might need it. you just never know what you might run into around here. that's true, like an old man carrying wood might come in. now a man needs a gun to draw in a case like that. let's drop it, maggie. sure. tell me, del, what's new in town? not much. i hear lucy benson's gone and got herself twins. morning, red. get out of the way, maggie! do what the man says, maggie. step back out of the way. have you two gone loco? you didn't think i'd catch up with you, did you, delaney? i was hoping you wouldn't, red. it'd make sense. first you run away, so you won't have to face me... and now, here you are hiding behind a female's skirts. move aside, mag. move aside! no, i'm not budging from this spot until you hear me out. i've known you a long time, del. i know you're fast with that gun, but i ain't never known you to pick a fight. i didn't pick this one, either. this buck here is set on forcing my hand. now, hold on a minute. what have you got against del? he's yellow. he'll fight a man when he's liquored up, but not when he's sober. what do you mean by that? i'll tell you what he means by that. we was playing cards last night. this hard-headed coyote has too much to drink... gets real reckless. i couldn't play with him when i saw how drunk he was. i decided to quit the game. you decided to quit when you was ahead. you wouldn't give me a chance to get even, would you? kid, i could've cleaned you out. you was so drunk, you couldn't even sort your own cards. you mean all of this is over a hand of poker? it was more than that. this redheaded buck here objects to my quitting. he gets wild. he starts calling me names i don't like to be called. tells me to go for my gun, says he could outdraw me. i would've, too. kid, i could've sent you to boot hill before your hand even touched leather. but i get no kick out of killing drunk cowboys. well, now, will you hear him, maggie? you know what he done last night? he flanged a glass of whiskey in my face. and then when i was blinded, he hit me in the eye with a bottle. it was a fist, laddie. not a bottle. fist or bottle. it was still a yellow play. of all the stupid... red, you act like you're still liquored up. maggie, it's best you keep out of this. no, i won't. del's right, he could've killed you last night, but he used his head. now you're mad because you think he made a fool of you at the saloon. grow up, red. all right, maggie. ask him what he's doing way out here. i'll tell you what. when he heard this morning that i was gunning for him... he saddled up and he hightailed it right out of town. that's right. i didn't want to kill you last night 'cause you was too drunk. i don't want to kill you this morning 'cause you was too full of hurt pride. figured it'd be easier to just leave town for a while. you're a dirty, lying coward. you ain't very bright, are you, kid? all right, i tried. but i'm through trying now. you're sober. if it's a fight you want, you'll get it. let me talk to him, del. it won't do no good, maggie. use a little horse sense, red. del done you a favor last night. so you think he made a fool out of you. that's better than shooting you down. if he could've shot me down. i say, even drunk, i could outdraw him. now you know better than that. why, del here's the best- lay up, maggie! maybe you could talk him in to quitting, but not me. it's too far gone now. all right, go on, kill each other. you're both too loco to live. my ham's burning... and a piece of ham's worth more than either one of you wild cats. all right, which one's going to be the killer? which one gets the rope around his neck? what are you jabbering about, maggie? i'm going to kill this bucko here fair and square. you're wrong, red. you're both going to die. and i aim to see to it. i'm a witness and i'll swear to the first man i see draw his gun. and it'll be murder. and the first man to draw is going to hang. you'll see. all right. who's going to be the killer? who do i tell the sheriff drew first? i'm waiting, red. you're anxious to make the first play, go ahead. go on. no, delaney, i'll let you make the first move. you'll need the extra break. maggie's words make sense. if i draw first, then i get charged with murder. i figure it'd be best to let you hit your leather before i do... and i could still outdraw you. well, now, fancy that. you know, i was thinking the very same thing. you could have that pistol half cleared, and i could still beat you. to the law, it would be self-defense. you're both too cocky for your own good. it looks like you are both going to wait for the other one to draw first. it's a shame to waste this ham, so... i think i'll just scramble up some eggs... and then you can both eat while you're waiting. i'll eat later. you'll eat lead and that's all. go for your gun and find out. no, delaney, after you. smells good, maggie. you could both use some food in your bellies. a man's got a better temper on a full stomach. i said later. getting jumpy, delaney? maggie, fix me a place this side of the table. maybe me sitting down... will give old whiskey-tosser here... enough advantage for him to chance a draw against me. there now. that ought to be advantage enough. all right, delaney. make your play. i don't need an advantage over you, tinhorn. all right, maggie. i've changed my mind. i'll eat now. fix two places. here now, maggie. bring the man his last meal. i'm the one that'll be feeding tonight. you'll be feeding, too. feeding the buzzards. two orders, coming up. you know, maggie, it's too bad you have to feed this here bucko. i hate to see such good food wasted on a corpse. talk's cheap, red. try a little action. after you. you ought to be ashamed. two grown men acting like kids. both hands on the table. sure. why not? maggie, cut my ham for me. i'm one-handed today. cut mine, too, maggie. big, brave men. all you think about is nerve and how fast you can draw a gun. del here is fast, maggie. but i'm just a wee bit faster. glad you're going to be eating, red. man can't talk nonsense when his mouth's full. why don't you drop your right hand down to your holster... and see who's talking nonsense? why don't you? why don't you both shut up? if you'd do more thinking than talking, you'd be better off. she was married to a gunfighter, wasn't she? charlie ryann. she's seen fights before, then. what's she so upset about? you talking about me? about your husband. you leave charlie out of this. he was a better man than you two put together. i hear tell he had seven notches on his gun. that's right. seven notches. but he had even a bigger score later on. he had 12 wreaths at his funeral. go ahead. pick up your fork. what's stopping you? not a thing. you can't eat a meal while you stare straight ahead. i can. never thought i'd see the day. a meal should be eaten in peace, not like this. this won't take long, maggie. del here is going to break soon, you watch. soon as he thinks i am off my guard, he'll make his move. mighty good ham, maggie. can't you see how silly this is? look, neither one of you want to draw first. well, then don't. finish your meal... and then ride off in different directions. look, del here's proved he's no coward. and aside from him calling you yellow, you got no cause to shoot him down. it was just a silly misunderstanding. can't you see that? no, i guess you can't. i couldn't make charlie listen. i don't see how i can make you. i know what you're thinking of, maggie. you think it's about time ben morgan got back from town. that's silly, i wasn't thinking any such thing. what about ben? ben's doing some handy jobs for maggie. went in to town to get some kerosene. he ought to be back pretty- go for your gun, and we'll settle it right now! i am still waiting for you. you know there's a pretty little curl right in the middle of your forehead. i was thinking it'd be a nice spot to aim at. move your hand down to your gun. go ahead. still trying to prod me into making the first move, now, aren't you, delaney? both of you shut up and finish your meal. it's getting cold. i have had enough. me, too. all right, maggie, step back out of the way. you might get hurt. at least drink some more coffee. step back out of the way, i said. get back, maggie! del, i got me an idea. maggie, what time is it by that old clock? few minutes till noon. that is a cuckoo clock. i've seen it before. what are you getting at? just this. maybe i was wrong when i thought you were so yellow that you'd draw first. maybe you really were waiting for me. so? so i don't aim to draw first and wind up with a rope around my neck. let's begin even. we'll both stand. and then we'll agree that neither of us will draw... until that cuckoo bird sticks its neck out of that clock. but when it does, we both hit leather. no, that's crazy- what do you say, del? it makes sense. nobody draw till the birdie cries. finish your meal. at least take some time to think. take off your coat. i don't want to have an advantage. sure, i'll take off my coat. and then you'll draw. no, thank you very much. suit yourself, laddie. get away from that clock. if you stop it, i'll kill him anyway. just one favor, that's all. the crucifix. let me get the crucifix. it's on the shelf with the clock. charlie gave it to me the day we were married. a wild bullet might hit it. wild bullet? his might be wild, not mine. please let me get it. i won't touch the clock. all right, get it. but make it fast. we don't have much time. now get out of the way quick! what's taking so long? maggie. what time is it? glory be. thank god. i said what time is it? it's time to fall on your knees, red hillman. fall down and beg forgiveness. look at that clock. it's stopped. what's she talking about? i don't know, but i can't hear no more ticking of the clock. less than a minute to go and the clock stops. red, del, think of it. can't you see? stand back! you won't shoot, you can't. the hand of god stopped that clock. i swear i didn't touch it. sort of strange. you both swore you wouldn't shoot until the bird cried. it ain't never going to cry. god stopped it. it ain't ever going to cry again. del. i'm turning around. i won't shoot. you're both men of your word. and i heard you both swear you wouldn't draw... till that clock reached noon. the good lord is going to hold you to that word. neither one of you can outdraw him. i'll be riding back to town with you, del. the meal's on me, boys. thanks, maggie. i'll see you later. maggie, guess who i seen out in front. red hillman and delaney. the both of them! so? the talk in town says them two are on the prod. you figure they're going to fight it out right out in front? i reckon not. hey, i told you not to move that! maggie, the last time i fixed this old clock... i told you it wouldn't run unless it was set on the level. i know. i know. dang it! leave things be. or put it on a shelf that don't tilt. there. you get the kerosene, ben? put it in the shed. then i better start baking your apple pie. that was disappointing, wasn't it? still, you will be happy to learn that both del and red did die eventually. that very day, in fact. food poisoning. maggie's heart was in the right place. she just wasn't a very good cook. and now, let us hear a word or two from our sponsor. a word or two, or three, or four, five, six, seven... ...511, 512... 513. thank you, sir."
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"approaching omicron ceti 3, sir. standard orbit, mr. painter. yes, sir. captain. yes, lieutenant. i've been transmitting a contact signal every five minutes. all i get is dead air. shall i continue? maintain transmission pattern until we've established orbit. aye, aye, sir. mr. spock... there were 150 men, women, and children in that colony. what are the chances of survivors? absolutely none, captain. berthold rays are such a recent discovery we do not yet have full knowledge of their nature. it is known, however, that living animal tissue disintegrates under exposure. sandoval's group could not have survived after three years. are you saying that those people built a future in a place knowing they might not survive? i am saying they knew there was a risk. can we afford to send people to the planet's surface? the breakdown of tissue does not develop immediately. we can risk a limited exposure. we've established orbit, sir. and i've pinpointed a settlement. thank you, mr. painter. mr. spock, equip a landing party of five to accompany me to the planet's surface. include dr. mccoy and a biologist. i'll want them in 10 minutes. [transporter effect whines] [tricorder hums] [kirk] another dream that failed. there's nothing sadder. it took these people a year to make the trip from earth. they came all that way and died. hardly that, sir. welcome to omicron ceti 3. i'm elias sandoval. space... the final frontier. these are the voyages of the starship enterprise. its five-year mission-- to explore strange, new worlds... to seek out new life and new civilizations... to boldly go where no man has gone before. captain 's log. : star date 3417.3 -- we thought our mission to omicron ceti 3 would be an unhappy one. we had expected to find no survivors of the agricultural colony there. apparently, our information was incorrect. we haven't seen anyone outside our group for four years since we left earth. we've been expecting someone for some time. our subspace radio didn't work properly. we didn't have anyone who could master its intricacies. actually, mr. sandoval, we didn't come here because of your silent radio. it makes little difference, captain. you're here. we're happy to see you. let me show you our settlement. pure speculation, just an educated guess, i'd say that man is alive. captain, this planet is being bombarded by berthold rays as our reports indicated. at this intensity, we'll be safe for a week if necessary. but... but these people shouldn't be alive. is it possible that they're not? you shook hands with him, jim. his flesh was warm. he's alive. there's no doubt about that. there's also no question of the fact that berthold rays are incontrovertibly deadly. there's no miracle connected with it. no cures, no serums, no antidotes. if a man is exposed long enough, he dies. gentlemen... we're debating in a vacuum. let's go get some answers. there are two other settlements, but we have 45 colonists here. what was the reason for the dispersal? we felt three groups would have better potential. if disease were to strike one group, the others would be less likely to be affected. omicron is an ideal agricultural planet. we determined not to suffer the fate of expeditions that went before us. elias. leila, come meet our guests. this is leila kalomi, our botanist. captain kirk, dr. mccoy, mr. spock. mr. spock and i have met before. it's been a long time. mr. sandoval, we do have a mission here. examinations, tests. by all means, make them. i think you'll find our settlement an interesting one. our philosophy is a simple one: that men should return to a less complicated life. we have few mechanical things here. no vehicles, no weapons. we have harmony here. complete peace. we'll try not to interfere with your work. make yourselves at home, gentlemen. what exactly are we looking for anyway, sir? whatever doesn't look right. whatever that is. when it comes to farms, i wouldn't know what looked right or wrong if it were 2 feet from me. hey. what is it? no cows. this barn isn't even built for them, just for storage. come to think of it, we haven't seen any animals. no horses, no pigs, not even a dog. nothing. you've known the vulcanian? on earth, six years ago. did you love him? if i did, it was important only to myself. how did he feel? mr. spock's feelings were never expressed to me. it is said he has none to give. would you like him to stay with us now? to be as one of us? there is no choice, elias. he will stay. [medical tricorder hums] that'll be all. thank you very much. anything? i've examined nine men so far varying in ages from 23 to 59. they're all in perfect condition. text book responses. heart/lungs, excellent. coordination, excellent. reflexes, excellent. many more of them, and i can throw away my shingle. [communicator beeps] kirk here. spock here, captain. there seems to be a total absence of life on the planet with the exception of the colonists and various types of flora. sulu had the same observation. any explanations? not at the moment, sir. i am conducting various tests, but results are inconclusive. very well. continue investigations. kirk out. hmm. no animals? that's peculiar. especially in view of the fact that the records indicate that they had some for breeding and food purposes. apparently, none of them survived. i'd like to see their medical records. i thought you might. oh, captain, i've been looking for you. you haven't seen our fields and crops. i'd like to show you what we've accomplished here. i'll have to bow out. i have to continue with these medical examinations. however, if i find everyone else's health to be as perfect as yours, i... he promised to throw away his shingle. you'll find no weaklings here. captain. this is the reason, captain. this soil will grow anything we plant in it. it's a perfect world. we have a moderate climate, moderate rains all year round. it gives us all we need. it is perfect. pardon me, captain. biology report ready, sir. i have work to attend to myself, captain. go ahead, lieutenant. i heard sandoval saying they could grow anything here. that's true. they've got a variety of crops in. grains, potatoes, beans. make your point. well, for an agricultural colony, they have actually very little acreage planted. there's enough to sustain the colony, but very little more. it's like a jigsaw puzzle all one color. no key to where the pieces fit in. why? [communicator beeps] kirk here. this is mccoy, jim. i think you better get back here. trouble? no, but you should see this for yourself. on my way. sandoval's medical record four years ago. he registered scar tissue on his lungs from lobar pneumonia suffered when he was a child. no major operations, but there was an appendectomy. received all required inoculations, et cetera. what's so strange about that? nothing. but i examined that man no more than two hours ago. know what his readings were? perfect, perfect, and perfect. just like everyone else i've examined here. instrument malfunction? i thought of that and tested it on myself. it accurately recorded my lack of tonsils and those two broken ribs i had once. it did not record the scar tissue on sandoval's lungs, but it did record a healthy appendix where one was supposedly removed. [tricorder hums] nothing. not even insects. yet your plants grow, and you've survived exposure to berthold rays. that can be explained. please do. later. i have never understood the female capacity to avoid a direct answer to any question. and i never understood you. until now. there was always a place in here where no one could come. there was only the face you allow people to see. only one side you'd allow them to know. i would like to know how your people have managed to survive here. i missed you. logically, you should all be dead. if i tell you how we survive, will you try to understand how we feel about our life here? about each other? emotions are alien to me. i'm a scientist. someone else might believe that-- your shipmates, your captain-- but not me. come. mr. sandoval, i've received orders from starfleet command to evacuate all personnel from this colony. naturally, you'll inform your people to begin preparations. we will have accommodations for you aboard the enterprise. no. uh, it's not an arbitrary decision on my part. i have my orders. captain, it's entirely unnecessary. we're in no danger here. we've explained the berthold rays to you and their effect. can't you understand? doctor, how can i make you understand? your own instruments have shown we're all in perfect health. we've had no deaths here. what about your animals? we're vegetarians. that doesn't answer my question, sir. why did all your animals die? captain, you stress very unimportant matters. we will not leave. it's not much further. you've not yet explained the nature of this thing. its basic properties and elements are not important. what is important is it gives life, peace, love. what you're describing was once known in the vernacular as a happiness pill. and you, as a scientist, should know that that's not possible. come. i was one of the first to find them. the spores. spores? no... it shouldn't hurt. no, i can't. please, don't! not like this, it didn't hurt us. i am not like you. now... now you belong to all of us... and we to you. there's no need to hide your inner face any longer. we understand. i love you. i can love you. captain 's log. : supplemental. we have been ordered by starfleet command to evacuate the colony on omicron 3. however, the colony leader, elias sandoval, has refused all cooperation and will not listen to any arguments. sandoval. your arguments are very valid, but they don't apply to us. you're being unreasonable. nevertheless, excuse me. excuse me. my orders are to remove all the colonists. that's exactly what i intend to do with or without your help. without, i should think. would you like to use a butterfly net on him? captain! we've checked out everything. it all seems normal except for the absence of any animals. we have orders to evacuate all colonists to star base 27. i want landing parties to coordinate the colonists and prepare them for transport up to the ship. we'll need extra accommodations aboard. where's mr. spock and mr. desalle? we haven't seen them since we began our check. desalle was going to examine some native plants. did spock call in at all? no, he didn't. spock? see to the landing parties, mr. sulu. spock? [beep beep] that one looks like a dragon. you see the tail and the dorsal spines? i've never seen a dragon. - [beep beep] - i have. - [beep beep] - on berengaria 7. but i've never stopped to look at clouds before. [beep beep beep] or rainbows. i can tell you exactly why one appears in the sky, but considering its beauty has always been out of the question. not here. [beep beep] [beep beep] [beep beep] spock! yes. what did you want? spock, is that you? yes, captain. what did you want? where are you? i don't believe i want to tell you. i don't know what you think you're doing, but this is an order. report back to the settlement in 10 minutes. we're evacuating all colonists to star base 27. no, i don't think so. you don't think so, what? i don't think so, sir. spock... report to me immediately. spock? acknowledge. spock. the frequency is open, but he doesn't answer. that didn't sound at all like spock, jim. no, it -- i thought you said you might like him if he mellowed a little. i didn't say that! not exactly. he might be in trouble. yes, take over the landing party detail. start getting those colonists aboard. how will you find spock? the frequency is open. it'll act as a homing device. contact desalle. have him meet you here. have the landing party work in teams of two. i don't want anybody left alone here. [communicator whines] ha ha ha ha! ha ha ha ha! spock. ahem! mr. spock? what are you doing with those things, desalle? i want you to take a close look at these, doc. they're very interesting. mr. spock. are you out of your mind? you were told to report to me at once. i didn't want to, jim. you -- yes, i can see that. miss kalomi, you'll have to come back to the settlement and prepare to transport up to the ship. there'll be no evacuation, jim. but perhaps we should go get you straightened out. mr. sulu, mr. spock is under arrest, and he's in your custody until we get back to the enterprise. very well. come with me. what's... mr. sulu understands, don't you, mr. sulu? yes. i see now. of course we can't remove the colony. it'd be wrong. i don't know what these plants are or how they work, but you're all going back to the settlement with me, and those colonists are going aboard the ship. i can see the captain's going to be difficult. ready to beam up. hiya, jimmy boy! hey, i've taken care of everything. all y'all gotta do is relax. doctor's orders! how many of those did you beam up? oh, nigh onto 100 by now. hey, doc, i'm ready to energize. everything okay with those plants? this is the captain. beam me up. well, sure, if you want. i most certainly do. energize. lieutenant... put me through to admiral komak at starfleet. oh, i'm sorry, captain. i can't do that. what? follow standard procedure. that's an order. oh, i know it is, captain. but, you see, all communications are out. out? i short-circuited them, except ship-to-surface. we'll need that for a while. it's really for the best, captain. go back to your stations. get back to your stations. i'm sorry, sir. we're all transporting down to join the colony. i said get back to your station. no, sir. this is mutiny, mister. yes, sir. it is. captain 's log. : star date 3417.5. the pod plants have spread spores throughout the ship carried by the ventilation system. under their influence, my crew is deserting to join the omicron colony, and i can't stop them. i don't know why i have not been infected, nor can i get dr. mccoy to explain the physical, psychological aspects of the infection. i'm not interested in any physical, psychological aspects, jim-boy. we all perfectly healthy down here. i've heard that word a lot lately. perfect. everything's perfect. yeah. that's right. thats just what it is. i'll bet you've even grown your tonsils back. sho'nuf. hey, jim-boy, y'all ever have a real cold georgia-style mint julep, huh? look, bones, i need your help. can you run tests, blood samples, anything to give us a lead on what these things are, how to counteract them? who wants to counteract paradise, jim-boy? mccoy out. bones. bones. almost the entire ship's complement has beamed down. i'm very pleased. the entire landing operation is proceeding quite well. where's mccoy? he went off to create something called a mint julep. that's a drink, jim. captain, why don't you join us? in your own private paradise. the spores have made it that. where did they originate? that's impossible to say. they drifted through space until they finally landed here. you see, they actually thrive on berthold rays. the plants act as a repository for thousands of microscopic spores until they find a human body to inhabit. in return, they give you complete health and peace of mind. that's paradise? we have no need or want, captain. it's a true eden, jim. there is belonging... and love. no wants. no needs. we weren't meant for that. none of us. man stagnates if he has no ambition, no desire to be more than he is. we have what we need. except a challenge. you don't understand, jim, but you'll come around... sooner or later. join us. please. i'm going back to the ship. engineering? scotty? biochemistry lab? security? is there anyone on board? this is the captain. captain's log : star date 3417.7. except for myself, all crew personnel have transported to the surface of the planet. mutinied. lieutenant uhura has effectively sabotaged the communications station. i can only contact the surface of the planet. the ship... can be maintained in orbit for several months, but even with automatic controls, i cannot pilot her alone. in effect, i am marooned here. i'm beginning to realize... just how big this ship really is, how quiet. i don't know how to get my crew back, how to counteract the effect of the spores. i don't know what i can offer against... paradise. enterprise to mr. spock. yes, jim. what is it now? i've joined you. i understand now. wonderful, jim. when will you beam down? there's some things i want to pack. good. leila and i will meet you at the beam-down point. kirk out. no. no! i... can't... leave! emotions. violent emotions. needs. anger. captain's log : supplemental. i think i've discovered the answer... but to carry out my plan entails considerable risk. mr. spock is much stronger than the ordinary human being. aroused, his great physical strength could kill. but it's a risk i'll have to take. enterprise to mr. spock. spock here. it's jim. what's keeping you? we've been waiting. i've been packing, and i realize there's some equipment here that we should have down at the settlement. you know we can't come back on board once the last of us has left. you want me to beam up a party? no. i think you and i can handle it. why don't you beam up now? just a moment. it won't take long. do you mind? i'll wait. ready to beam up, jim. energizing. all right, you mutinous, disloyal, computerized, half-breed, we'll see about you deserting my ship. the term half-breed is somewhat applicable, but computerized is inaccurate. a machine can be computerized, not a man. what makes you think you're a man? you're an overgrown jackrabbit, an elf with a hyperactive thyroid. jim, i don't understand-- of course you don't understand. you don't have the brains to understand. all you have is printed circuits. captain, if you'll excuse me -- what can you expect from a simpering, devil-eared freak whose father was a computer and his mother an encyclopedia? my mother was a teacher. my father, an ambassador. your father was a computer like his son. an ambassador from a planet of traitors. a vulcan never lived who had an ounce of integrity. captain, please don't -- you're a traitor from a race of traitors. disloyal to the core, rotten like the rest of your subhuman race, and you've got the gall to make love to that girl. that's enough. does she know what she's getting, spock? a carcass full of memory banks who should be squatting in a mushroom instead of passing himself off as a man? you belong in a circus, spock, not a starship... right next to the dog-faced boy. had enough? i didn't realize what it took to get under that thick hide of yours. i don't know what you're so mad about. it isn't every first officer who gets to belt his captain... several times. you did that to me deliberately. believe me, mr. spock, it was painful... in more ways than one. the spores. they're gone. i don't belong anymore. you said they were benevolent and peaceful. violent emotions overwhelm them, destroy them. i had to make you angry enough to shake off their influence. that's the answer, mr. spock. that may be correct, captain, but trying to initiate a brawl with over 500 crewmen and colonists is hardly logical. i had something else in mind. can you put together a subsonic transmitter-- something we can hook into the communications station and broadcast over the communicator? it can be done. good. let's get to work. captain. striking a fellow officer is a court-martial offense. if we're both in the brig, who's going to build the subsonic transmitter? that is quite logical, captain. it's a little early to be counting stars, miss leila. i'm waiting for mr. spock and the captain to transport down. they had some equipment to be moved. but it's been so long. i wish he'd come back. well, now, i think i can fix that for you. enterprise? [beep beep] enterprise. spock here. this is leila. i borrowed the doctor's communicator. i was worried something might have happened to you. you are all right, arent you? yes. yes. i'm...i'm quite well. can i come aboard? i've never seen a starship before, and i want to talk to you. are you still at the beam-down point, and is the doctor there? yes to both questions. give your communicator back to dr. mccoy. you won't need it to beam up. it'll take a few moments. just wait there. out. mr. spock... miss kalomi is strictly your concern, but... should you talk to her while she's still under the influence of the spore? i'll be back shortly, captain. you're no longer with us, are you? i felt something was wrong. it was necessary. come back to the planet with me. you can belong again. oh, come back with me, please. i can't. i love you. i said that six years ago, and i can't seem to stop repeating myself. on earth, you couldn't give anything of yourself. you couldn't even put your arms around me. we couldn't have anything together there. we couldn't have anything together anyplace else. we're happy here. i can't lose you now, mr. spock. i can't. i have a responsibility... to this ship... to that man on the bridge. i am what i am, leila... and if there are self-made purgatories, then we all have to live in them. mine can be no worse than someone else's. i have lost you, haven't i? not only you, i've lost all of it. the spores... i've lost them, too. the captain discovered that strong emotions and needs destroy the spore influence. and this is for my good? do you mind if i say i still love you? you never told me if you had another name, mr. spock. you couldn't pronounce it. they'll not hear this, of course. it'll be more a sensation of feeling it. like somebody had put itching powder on their skin. precisely. it should begin to work on their nerves in a few minutes. [high-pitched hum] sorry, desalle. what do you think you're doing? i said i was sorry. more like you're clumsy. if you hadn't gotten in my way... ooh! come on. break it up. break it up. well, doctor, i've been thinking about what sort of work i could assign you to. what do you mean what sort of work? i'm a doctor. not anymore, of course. we don't need you... not as a doctor. oh, no? would you like to see how fast i can put you in a hospital? i am the leader of this colony. i'll assign you whatever work i think suitable. just a minute. you'd better make me a mechanic. then i can treat little tin gods like you. sorry, sandoval. i don't know what made me do that. we've done nothing here. no accomplishments, no progress. three years wasted. we wanted to make this planet a garden. you can't stay here. you can't survive without the spores. after you've cleared at the star base, you could be relocated. it depends upon what you want. i think i'd... i think we'd like to get some work done. the work we started out to do. enterprise. enterprise. spock here. this is mccoy. sandoval would like to talk to the captain. just a moment. they're all beginning to call in, captain. rather contritely, i should say. sandoval wishes to speak to you. put him on the speaker. kirk here. oh, captain, as i understood it, you were to transport us to star base 27. we'll give you every cooperation. start making preparations, mr. sandoval. we'll begin transporting your people aboard as soon as more of our crew checks in. well, jim, i've just examined the last of the colonists, and they're all in absolutely perfect, perfect health. a fringe benefit left over by the spores. good. well, that's the second time man's been thrown out of paradise. no, no. this time we walked out on our own. maybe we weren't meant for paradise. maybe we were meant to fight our way through -- struggle, claw our way up, scratch for every inch of the way. maybe we can't stroll to the music of the lute. we must march to the sound of drums. poetry, captain. non regulation. we haven't heard much from you about omicron ceti 3, mr. spock. i have little to say about it, captain, except that for the first time in my life... i was happy."
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"that should make a good specimen. temperature's starting to drop. yeah. at night it gets down to 120 degrees below zero. that's nippy. hey! [rocks sliding] what happened? i fell off that bank, sir. cut my hand. get back to the ship. report to the sick bay. geological technician fisher. ready to beam up. locked onto you. energize. [beeping] coadjutor engagement. what happened? i took a flop. onto what? some kind of yellow ore. magnetic. decontaminate that uniform. yes, sir. that acted like a burnout. captain kirk ready to beam up. just one moment, captain. it checks out ok now. you better get a synchronic meter so we can double-check. all right, captain. locked onto you. are you all right, captain? yes, i'm all right. just a little dizzy. i can't get through there. nothing serious. don't leave the transporter room unattended. wilson will be right back, sir. space... the final frontier. these are the voyages of the starship enterprise. its five-year mission-- to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. captain's log, stardate 1672.1. specimen-gathering mission on planet alpha 177. unknown to any of us during this time, a duplicate of me, some strange alter ego, had been created by the transporter malfunction. [door opens] captain? are you all right, sir? can i give you a hand, sir? captain? bridge to all decks. section duty officers, check communication lines. thank you. maybe dr. mccoy should look at you. all right, engineer, i'll have my engines checked. ship's manifests, sir. they're in order. thank you, yeoman. that's all. yes, sir. you picked a good day, fisher. business has been lousy. did you fall on purpose to get vacation? saurian brandy. back to duty status. i have no sympathy for clumsiness. no, sir. the hand's much better, sir. what can i do for you, jim? i said, give me the brandy! [knock on door] yep? mr. spock. come in. yes, mr. spock, what is it? is there something i can do for you, captain? like what? well, dr. mccoy seemed to think i should check on you. that's nice. come on, spock, i know that look. what is it? well, our good doctor said that you were acting iike a wild man, demanded brandy. our good doctor's been putting you on again. hmm. well, in that case, if you'll excuse the intrusion, i'll get back to work. i'll tell him you were properly annoyed. captain. what is it, scotty? transporter breakdown. we beamed up this animal-- look for yourself. it's in here. [rrr ruff ruff] yes? a few seconds after they sent this one through the transporter, that duplicate appeared. except it's an opposite. two similar animals, but different. one gentle--this. one mean and fierce-- that. some kind of savage, ferocious opposite. captain, we don't dare send mr. sulu and the landing party up. if this should happen to a man... oh, my... oh! captain. you startled me. is there something that you-- can i help you, captain? jim will do here, janice. ohh. you're too beautiful to ignore. too much woman. we've both been-- pretending too long. stop pretending. aah! let's stop pretending. come here, janice. don't fight me. don't fight me, janice. captain! just a minute, janice. just a minute! aah! call mr. spock! call mr. spock! geological technician fisher. deck 12, section-- me? my yeoman said that? i've been resting here since you left me. alone, mr. spock. dr. mccoy reports you demanded brandy in sick bay and left with it. i found this bottle in yeoman rand's quarters. not true. i haven't been to sick bay. let's find out what's going on. sick bay. then he kissed me and he said that we-- that he was the captain, and he could order me. i didn't know what to do. when you mentioned the feelings we'd been hiding, and you started talking about us. us? well, you-- he is the captain. i couldn't just-- you started hurting me. i had to fight you, scratch your face. yeoman. and-- look at me. look at my face. are there any scratches? i was sure i scratched you. i was frightened. maybe-- yeoman. i was in my room. it wasn't me. sir, fisher saw you, too. fisher saw-- if it hadn't been-- i can understand. i don't want to get you into trouble. i wouldn't have even mentioned it! it wasn't me! it was you, sir. are you sure? yes, sir. i'm sure. back to that bed, bucko. you can go now, yeoman. there's only one logical answer. we have an impostor aboard. captain's log, stardate 1672.9. on the planet's surface, temperatures are beginning to drop, our landing party there in growing jeopardy. due to the malfunction of the ship's transporter, an unexplained duplicate of myself definitely exists. how did all this happen? when fisher came up, his suit was covered with a soft yellow ore that had highly unusual properties. it may have caused an overload. does the transporter work at all? yes, but if we transport the landing party, it might duplicate. how long will it take to find the trouble? can't say, sir. we just can't leave those four men down there. it's getting dark. they'll die! the surface temperature goes down to 120 degrees below zero. we're doing everything we can, sir. yes, i know, scotty. about your double, captain. yes, uh...yes. we'll have to find him. search parties, mr. spock. organize search parties. we can't take a chance on killing it. we don't know what would happen to you. that's right. we don't know, but the men have to be armed... the men are to be armed, with their phasers locked, i repeat, locked, on setting number one. there can't be any chance of him being killed. he's to be taken without... if the men are forced to fire, he can't be killed! how shall we explain it to them, captain? the search parties are to capture you? tell them... the search parties, captain. i'll make an announcement to the entire crew, tell them what happened. it's a good crew. they deserve to know. captain, no disrespect intended, but you must surely realize you can't announce the full truth to the crew. you haven't the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew. if you're anything less than perfect, they lose faith, and you lose command. yes, i do know that, mr. spock. what i don't know... is why i forgot that just now. mr. spock. if you see me slipping again, your orders... your orders... are to tell me. understood, captain. captain's log, stardate 1673.1. something has happened to me. somehow, in being duplicated, i have lost my strength of will. decisions are becoming more and more difficult. this is the captain speaking. there's an impostor aboard the ship, a man who looks exactly like me. this man is dangerous. utmost caution is to be observed. all crew members are to arm themselves. the impostor may be identified by scratches on his face. repeat--the impostor may be identified by scratches on his face. section chiefs, assign personnel to the search. all search parties report to...mr. spock for assignment. something? about the phaser weapons. to be set for stunning force and locked. oh, yes, yes. all hand phasers must be set on base cycle, stunning force. the impostor is not to be injured. use minimum force. i'm captain kirk! --is not to be injured. i'm captain kirk. i'm captain kirk! i'm captain kirk! i'm captain kirk! wilson! sir? wilson, give me your phaser. yes, sir. how have you been? fine, sir. how's it going down there, mr. sulu? it's already 20 degrees below zero. can't exactly call it balmy. isn't there any way we can help them? thermal heaters were transported down. they duplicated. they won't operate. then we've got to get those men up. mr. spock? spock here. transporter technician wilson found injured near the captain's cabin. he says the impostor attacked him, called him by name, took his hand phaser. acknowledged. continue the search. we've got to find him before he-- but how? apparently, this double, however different in temperament, has your knowledge of the ship-- its crew, its devices. this being the case, perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move. knowing how the ship is designed, where would you go to elude a search? the lower levels. the engineering deck. set and locked on base cycle to stun, not to kill. what about your phaser, captain? don't you think we ought to get some help? no. i don't want anyone else to see the... captain, you ordered me to tell you. mr. spock, if i'm to be the captain, i've got to act like one. you can't hurt me. you can't kill me. you can't. don't you understand? i'm part of you. you need me. i need you. i don't need you. [electrical crackling] he'll be regaining consciousness soon, and not knowing what his physical state is, i won't give him a tranquilizer. we'd better bind him. yes...yes. all right. what's the matter with me? judging from my observations, captain, you're losing the power of decision. you have a point, spock? yes. always, doctor. we have here an unusual opportunity to appraise the human mind, or to examine, in earth terms, the roles of good and evil in a man-- his negative side, which you call hostility, lust, violence, and his positive side, which earth people express as compassion, iove, tenderness. are you aware it's the captain's guts you're analyzing? yes, and what makes one man an exceptional leader? we see indications that it's his negative side which makes him strong, that his evil side, controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. your negative side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you. what is your point, mr. spock? if your power of command weakens, you'll be unable to be captain. you must be prepared for that. you have your intellect, jim. you can fight with that! for how long? if i seem insensitive to what you're going through, understand-- it's the way i am. captain kirk. kirk here. mr. scott, sir, on the lower level of the engineering deck. i found the new trouble with the transporter. the casing has a gap ripped in it. the main circuits have been burned through. the abort control circuit is gone altogether. can you give us a status report, captain? temperature's still dropping. now 41 degrees below zero. we've located the trouble. it shouldn't be much longer. could you find a long rope somewhere and lower us down a pot of hot coffee? i'll see what we can do. rice wine will do, if you're short on coffee. engineering deck, kirk here. scott here, captain. that unit, scotty, status report. the transporter unit ionizer-- nothing much left of it, sir. how bad is it? we can't repair it in less than a week. captain's log, stardate 1673.5. transporter still inoperable. my negative self is under restraint in sick bay. my own indecisiveness growing. my force of will steadily weakening. on the planet, condition critical. surface temperature is 75 degrees below zero, still dropping. i think we ought to give room service another call. that coffee's taking too long. enterprise, this is sulu. kirk here, mr. sulu. hot line direct to the captain? are we that far gone? i gave everybody the afternoon off. i'm watching the store. how is it down there? oh, lovely, except that the frost is building up. we're using hand phasers to heat the rocks. one phaser quit on us. three still operating. any possibility of getting us back aboard before the skiing season opens down here? this is spock, mr. sulu. you'll have to hold on a little longer. there's no other way. survival procedures, mr. sulu. per your training program, mr. spock. aah! aah! aah! aah! aah! what happened? apparently the body functioning weakened during the duplication process-- a fact i failed to consider. he's not dying? yes, he is. help me. how can he die? can i survive without him? i don't know, jim. don't be afraid. here's my hand. hold on. you don't have to be afraid. hold on! you won't be afraid if you use your mind! that's it! jim, he is back! jim. you can use that brandy now. in fact, i'll join you. i have to take him back... inside myself. i can't survive without him. i don't want him back. he's like an animal, a thoughtless, brutal animal, and yet it's me... me. jim... you're no different than anyone else. we all have our darker side. we need it! it's half of what we are. it's not ugly. it's human. human. a lot of what he is makes you the man you are. god forbid i should agree with spock, but he was right. without the negative side, you couldn't be the captain. your strength of command lies mostly in him. what do i have? you have the goodness. not enough. i have a ship to command. the intelligence, the logic-- it appears your half has most of that, and perhaps that's where man's essential courage comes from. for you see, he was afraid, and you weren't. captain kirk. kirk here. spock here. come to the transporter room. we may have found an answer. coming. what is it? we got the transporter working. we've attached to some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for the difference, tied directly into the impulse engines. there shouldn't be more than a 5-point variation in the velocity balance. i suggest we send the animal through. captain? yes. go ahead. [growling and snarling] i'll hold him as long as i can. don't hurt him. it's painless and quick. the animal will be unconscious for only a few minutes. [buzzing] [scott] lf this doesn't work, i don't know what will. energize. reverse. the shock of putting him back together was too much for him. he's dead, jim. [spock] captain's log, stardate 1673.1. entry made by second officer spock. captain kirk retains command of this vessel, but his force of will rapidly fading. condition of landing party critical. transporter unit still under repair. autopsy in-depth. hurry. i don't know. animal could have died of some kind of shock. for once, i agree with you. i said ""could have,"" spock. we won't know until we get a post-mortem. no autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified. it was split into two and thrust back together. thus shock induced by blind terror. that sounds likely. it couldn't understand. you can. you have your intelligence controlling your fear. get the transporter room ready. could be, if, maybe-- all guesswork, just theory. give me a chance to do an autopsy and let spock check the transporter circuits again. that sounds reasonable. we should double-check everything. aren't you forgetting something, captain? no, i don't think i f-- your men on the planet, how much time do they have? yes. the men. we have to take the chance. suppose it wasn't shock, jim. suppose death was caused by transporter malfunction. then you'd die. they'd die, anyway. don't risk your life on a theory! being split in two halves is no theory with me, doctor. i have a human half and an alien half at war with each other. personal experience, doctor. i survive because my intelligence wins, makes them live together. your intelligence would enable you to survive, as well. help me. somebody make the decision. are you relinquishing command, captain? no. no, i'm not. well, then we can't help you, jim. the decision is yours. mr. spock, ready the transporter room. bones, continue the autopsy. [uhura] captain kirk, i have a tie-in with sulu now. kirk here. captain...k-kirk... sulu here. 117 b-below. can't...last much longer. can't see clearly, doctor, to read top indicator. think the cold... penetrating communicator. two men...unconscious. no time. no... can't wait. no time. mr. sulu. mr. sulu. can't wait. can't let them die. what will you do? go through the transporter, both of us. there's nothing i can do to stop you? it's what i have to do. it's what i have to do, what we have to do. i won't fight you anymore. oh... i feel so weak. i'll be glad when this is over. janice, hello. captain, l-- yeoman, i owe you an explanation. the transporter malfunctioned, divided me, created a duplicate. the animal part of me came to your cabin. he even scratched me to make us look more alike. i'd like the chance to explain it to you. you don't mind if i come to your cabin later? no, sir. bridge. no word from mr. sulu, sir. prepare to leave orbit, mr. farrell. captain-- i gave you an order. they can't be saved. prepare to leave orbit. yes, sir. captain, i thought-- i've changed my mind. [door opens] grab him. he's the impostor. no! mccoy, he's fooled you. he attacked him. mr. spock, you know who i am and what that is. mr. spock, which one? what do we do? we'll let the captain handle this. i'm the captain. isn't that obvious? look at his face. remember the scratches? he's hiding them. he wants you to think that he's captain kirk. you know who i am. yes, i know. you want to kill me, don't you? farrell, james, grab him! he'll destroy the ship! don't you understand? i'm captain of the ship! i'm the captain! this is my ship! my ship! it's mine! i'll kill you. can half a man live? take another step, you'll die. then we'll both die. please. i don't want to. don't make me. i don't want to go back. please! i want to live! you will. both of us. i want to live! you'll have to hold on to him, captain. mr. spock. captain? if this doesn't work... understood, captain. mr. spock. ready. well, mr. spock? jim? get those men aboard fast. right away, captain. severe exposure and frostbite, but i think they'll make it. how do you feel, jim? how? i've seen a part of myself no man should ever see. status report, green. all sections report ready, sir. good. thank you, mr. spock... from both of us. shall i pass that on to the crew, sir? the impostor's where he belongs. let's forget him. captain. the impostor told me what happened, who he really was, and i'd just like to say that... well, sir, what i'd like-- thank you, yeoman. the, uh, impostor had some interesting qualities, wouldn't you say, yeoman? this is the captain speaking. navigator, set in course correction. helmsman, steady as she goes."

40 can buy an awful lot of wine. i’m on the wagon. sure you are, sure. well so long doc, thanks for everything. don't get that prescription filled in the neighborhood, no use pressing your luck. oh, don't worry about me. -personally mrs lewis i wouldn't take this stuff in a million years. -you wouldn't? if you ask me i think it eats holes in your liver. but mrs anderson swears by it, you know how, she used to get those terrible headaches. mrs anderson should stop prescribing for herself, and see the doctor that's what i think, let me ask you this, when did mrs anderson’s headache stop? when she started taking this chunk, or when her husband left it? -you know something you're right. -can i get this prescription filled please? just a minute sir. so do yourself a favor mrs lewis, -take what the doctor says, all rightl?

i thought maybe you could tell us that, what was vernon doing here, making a delivery? -it's my fault, all my fault. -what is? i sent poor vernon here, because i made a mistake an awful mistake, i’m always so careful, you've got to believe that, i’ve been a pharmacist for 36 years, but i made a mistake in the prescription, i gave a man a poison, a terrible poison, if he takes one of those capsules he'll die, i sent vernon here to find him to warn him. okay mr fletcher. you got to find that man, -you got to find that man. -sure sure we'll find him. -sooner or later. -you got to warn him. don't worry about it, pop, just don't worry about it. there is a group of men in this country, members of a noble profession, who each day go about their work quietly and efficiently, merely because this program shows one of these men blundering, is not meant as a condemnation of the whole group, what charlie did was inexcusable, but we certainly do not imply that all criminals would make the same mistake, and now a brief advertisement, after which i shall return. i must say horseshoes are very chic yet sensible this year, open-toed flats, now until next week, good night."

it will reach the atmosphere in 44 seconds and impact 11 seconds later. - ready torpedoes. - aye, sir. sir, it is unlikely another photon torpedo will be of any effect. - mr worf, prepare a tractor beam. - aye, sir. 30 seconds to impact. i am unable to get a lock with the tractor beam. there is magnetic-field interference emanating from the core materials. activate a deflector. if we send a particle beam, we may produce a disruptive nuclear effect. - aye, sir. - impact in 17 seconds. beam activated. the target has been destroyed. the remaining debris is of no threat to the planet, sir. well done, everyone. ensign, put us back on course. warp four when we clear the debris field. aye, sir. space, the final frontier. these are the voyages of the starship enterprise. its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. - my instructions were clear. - they were not! before play, he was to put his soiled clothing in the garment reprocessor. - i was not! - i sense a touch of hostility here. - you were specifically told that. - you told me yesterday, not today. - if i may suggest... - the same rule applies today that... please! why not simply draw up a contract which clearly defines the duties of each family member? you mean he tells me what he wants and i do it? no. i mean you both agree to your responsibilities. when you do what you've agreed to do, you've earned the privilege to do what you want to do. when he's cleaned his room, perhaps he can visit the holodeck to fight his alien monsters. you suggest bribery. i suggest working out an equitable system with the rules spelled out. for the child and the parent. you must list your responsibilities, too. what would you like your father to promise, alexander? - no yelling. - i do...! i do not yell. you should have no trouble with that part. why not go back to your quarters and talk this thing over? decide on which points each of you wants in the contract. very well. one day, you'll be glad your father cared enough about you to make rules. it may be hard to imagine right now, but eventually, most children come to appreciate their parents. riker to counsellor troi. your mother's just come aboard. on the other hand... deanna, my dear! lt's mother! i've got deliciously exciting news! you'll be absolutely thrilled. i'm getting married. you know, with just a bit of redecorating here and there, this ten-forward room should make a very nice wedding hall. i beg your pardon? where else, my little one, but here amongst my friends and in the presence of my adored daughter? mother, where did you... when did you meet this man? who is he? i mean, marriage? when did all this happen? my poor, plodding little deanna with her questions, questions, questions! wherever did you inherit such pedestrian genes? what matters is that your mother's happy. mother, if you're happy, then i'm happy for you. i only asked who he is and where you met him. those are not unusual questions. he's a wonderful man with such good breeding. he's absolute perfection. - who is he? - he is campio. third minister to the conference of judges from kostolain. royalty. naturally. i didn't know you'd been to kostolain. or was he on some diplomatic mission to betazed? well, neither, actually. you see, we haven't exactly met yet, really. but the profiles we've exchanged! they were in such accord that you could weep. you would weep at the harmony between us. mother, don't you think it would be a good idea if you met the man before spending the rest of your life with him? i love you, but you do make everything sound like an epitaph. i don't want to agree! you have to. that is what an agreement is. excuse the intrusion, but we're having some difficulty drawing up our contract. mrs troi. - he's not fair! - the boy is unreasonable. well, of course he's unreasonable. he's a child. and such a child. making little boys reasonable only gives them pimples. - alexander, this is my mother. - alexander? what a wonderful name! you know, i once knew a tall, handsome warrior named alexander. he utterly adored me. we went everywhere. simply everywhere! have you been anywhere...? contract? what contract? between father and son. a fair and balanced way to achieve a mutual sense of order. how ghastly for you. and you are doing this to your own child, mr woof? - mother...! - it is worf, madam. contracts are between people who don't trust one another. a child who is trusted becomes worthy of that trust. will you stay out of this? if he does not perform his contractual duties, i assume he will be chastised? he will be sanctioned, yes. if you fail to perform your duties, what can the child do about it? - will you please... - i? not perform my duty? alexander. now, life's true gift is the capacity to enjoy enjoyment. now. have i arrived too late, or can you still smile? she's getting married? yes. we should rendezvous with her intended in 31 hours. i will not have her using us for her convenience simply because her daughter is one of my officers. apparently deanna being on board is only one reason. the other reason being? she thinks the honour of giving away the bride should fall on you. permission for an on-board wedding is granted. nothing would please me more than to give away mrs troi. my little warrior! and how are you this morning? i see. being punished for something, are we? it's just my regular time to meet counsellor troi. she's not here yet. then you're early. that's very responsible of you. no, i just wanted to be out of my room before... before what? now, if we're to be real friends, we've got to share only the truth. why? for one thing, it's easier. when you tell the truth, you never have to remember what you lied about. but mostly, a true friend is a person you can always tell the truth to without worrying about it. i... i wanted to leave before my father got back. i hate him. i wish my mother were here. she died. it's not very fair, is it? all he cares about are rules. i'm supposed to do everything right all the time. i don't know how. to tell you the truth, little warrior, neither do i. but, i do know one marvellous thing we can do with rules. - i'm meant to see counsellor troi. - exactly. ever been to a colony of free spirits? - what do they do there? - whatever they want. artists, philosophers, freethinkers, and people who don't quite fit other people's rules. personally, i come for the mud baths. you're going to adore the mud baths! computer, i'm assuming that you have the parallax colony on shiralea vi? - that program is available. - good! then run it for us, dear. - what's that? - a wind dancer! he stands guard. only those whose hearts are joyous may enter. come on. fire sculptor. we'll chat later if you're not wearing anything flammable. hello. a few of us are just gathering for our laughing hour. would you care to come laugh with us? actually, we were about to experience a mud bath. were you? what an idea. we will join you. one can always laugh in the bath. - do you ever drop one? - no! these are my worlds. i protect them. i am a master of worlds. and they fly only as i wish. we're having guests for laughing hour. care to join us? - we'd love to. - no, thank you. - yes. - no. why do you always say no when i say yes? - i don't. - you just did. - there you go again. - why are they arguing? they're friends. they love contradiction. they thrive on challenge. they flourish in conflict. - then why are they friends? - who else can you fight with? hold! what is the lesson for today? damned if we know. we're just here for some fun and a mud bath. every moment requires a purpose. - no, it doesn't. - every purpose requires a plan. he does this every day, usually while everyone's food is getting cold. - it's rather boring. - the higher... ...the fewer. that's a conversation stopper if i ever heard one. - you're being stubborn. - i am not. - you are. - i am not! - yes, you are. - i am not. excuse me. if you're gonna argue, you should remember, the higher, the fewer. so, my little warrior wants to see more out of life than just fighting? the mind opens, and in creeps wisdom. alexander! ""be patient,"" she says. come! i can't believe this. isn't alexander with you? he didn't show up for his appointment. computer, what is the location of alexander rozhenko? alexander rozhenko is on holodeck two. is he there alone? he is with lwaxana troi. to all the creatures within us! ""to all the creatures within us""? of course. every one of us has a thousand different little people inside of us. and some of them want to get out and be wild, and some want to be sad or happy or inventive, or just go dancing. that's why we all have different urges at different times. and all those different little people inside of us, we must never be afraid to take them with us wherever we go. who knows when we may need one of them to pop up and rescue us from ourselves? variety, my little alex. the great secret is not the variety of life. - it's the variety of us. - are we ready for the entertainment? yes! bring on the entertainment. mother? little one! mr woof! come, join us. i'm trying to help the boy learn the value of responsibility. you're not helping by giving him mixed messages. i exposed you to all sorts of mixed messages. you still turned out dull. what are you so worried about? among other things, his relationship with his father. no more holodeck, mother. please. why aren't you making wedding plans? it's only three days away. i'm letting mr homn handle all the mundane details. he knows my tastes. mother... there's absolutely nothing to do, you nosy little girl! campio's sent his mother's wedding gown, which mr homn is altering. there isn't anything else... wedding gown? mother, stop. you're not going to be naked at your own wedding? campio's planet has different traditions. he would not approve of a traditional betazoid wedding, so i am happily adapting! simple as that. i need some tea. i can't believe i'm hearing this from the heir to the holy rings of betazed, holder of the sacred chalice of rixx. why can't i ever work this replicator? mother... i think it's time to talk about this mysterious marriage to a man you've never met. computer, some jestral tea, please. why shouldn't i get married if i choose to? you make everything into a mystery. there is no mystery, deanna! except about this petrokian sausage. the tea. all i wanted was a cup of tea. oh, dear, i think your replicator's having a nervous collapse. a diagnostic of the food-replication systems has failed to detect any faults in the terminals. but we've still had over 200 reports of malfunctioning replicators. an energy fluctuation in a utility-access corridor. well, we'd better look into it before the captain orders dinner. yeah. dash 64. here we are. some kind of intermittent em-field pattern. gimme a hand with that, will you? there's no plasma leakage. just a little negative-ion charging. bad enough having to wear anything at all to my own wedding, but this? perhaps if we lower the bodice... raise the hemline, then? what a constant joy you are! mr homn? alexander! my little warrior. come here. come on. give me a great big hug! now, you're not escaping another appointment, are you? no, ma'am. well, i suppose eventually we all have to live up to our obligations. well, now. tell me, what brings you here to brighten my day? i wanted to say i'm sorry if i got you in any trouble. that's very sweet, dear, but i really wasn't in any trouble. until i saw this dress! - ugly, isn't it? - what's it for? - i'm getting married. - why? are you sure my daughter didn't send you? just a joke. people get married because they want to spend their lives with someone. their whole life? they must like that person a lot. well, if you're young and lucky, it'll be someone you like a lot, yes. and if you're older... are you very old? i'm alone, alex. and when you do get older... ...and can no longer pick and choose from whatever may come your way... ...then you do what we call compromise. keeps you from being afraid. we traced the failure to an interface which routes replicator selections to the correct subprocessors. the interface had been transformed into a gelatinous material we haven't been able to identify. we have an intermittent failure of the inertial-damping system. take us out of warp. primary attitude control has failed. going to secondary. we have lost helm control. try a manual bypass of the damping systems. - backup generators. - coming on line now. how long before we regain control? almost there. ensign, put us back on course. stay at impulse for now. - did something hit us, mr worf? - negative, sir. the automatic bypass should have kicked in. i want to know what went wrong. analysis in 30 minutes. what happened to the replicator happened to the stabiliser. the transfers in both systems turned into this. - some sort of corrosion? - we do not yet know what it is. there's a conversion process turning the metal into gelatinous residue. the cause is a mystery. replicators and stabilisers are totally unrelated. and we still don't know why the sensors didn't pick up the problems. let's run a mass spectrometer analysis and find out what it is. transporter room one to capt picard. minister campio is beaming on board. i'll be right there. the bridegroom. campio! my dear, your compatibility profile doesn't do you justice. i am lwaxana, and any introductory compliment will be happily received. indeed, mrs troi, you are even lovelier in person. now, that worked just fine. now, now, we don't wish to be too familiar at this early juncture. forgive this tardiness. ship's business. minister campio, capt picard. welcome aboard. i thank you and greet you with appreciation for permitting this wedding aboard your fine vessel. - not at all, sir. - may i present my daughter? deanna troi, meet your future stepfather, come to think of it. yes. if i recall the profile, you are the ship's counsellor? i am, sir. and my escort, who need not be addressed, protocol master erko. campio? personally i absolutely adore all the ostentation i can get, but, protocol master? i would not do you, nor our hosts, the disservice of failing to ensure that priorities are observed. yes. how very thoughtful. it would be unpardonable simply to abandon ourselves to the moment. - would it not? - unpardonable! looks like the only alloy common to both replicator and stabiliser... ...is nitrium. computer, analyse the nitrium content of both stabiliser and replicator. there is no nitrium in the affected stabiliser or replicator. there is none in the residue either. the elements in the residue have been broken down into simpler structures. that suggests the nitrium has been organically metabolised. maybe that's it. if a living organism ingested the nitrium... ...this residue would be the waste left behind. if that's true, something's eating away at the nitrium on this ship. that means that the dilithium chamber is vulnerable and the power-transfer conduits. better get to engineering. eat, son. what are you doing? what is that noise? it's my laughing hour. that is enough, please. it is your dinner hour. eat. i promised to meet mrs troi for another lesson in happy wisdom. will you stop doing that, please? alexander, eat your food. wisdom will wait, i assure you. i promised. should i break my promise, father? a klingon never breaks his word. where are you going? you said no klingon breaks his word. i did not mean now. now just sit down and eat. i don't understand. you're confusing me. understand later. just eat. father? the higher, the fewer. i don't wish to be authoritative, but erko says now is our proper time for discussion of certain details. i don't want to be considered anti-erko, dear, but i did promise alexander one more holodeck trip. come along, my love. surely there'll be other occasions for you to spend time with the boy. my goodness, campio. you and i are going to have the rest of our lives. i tell you what. i'll be back here with you in one hour, alright? minister, the woman should not be addressing you in the familiar. - mother, we have to talk. - yes we do, dear, but not just now. well, how do i address him? we've come for alexander. forgive the intrusion. preferably he should be called by his ministerial title. i'll remember. mr homn, you make sure that everyone is comfortable until we get back. especially the minister here. i'll be back. one hour, darling. see you then. mrs troi, it is alexander's dinner hour. how thoughtless of me! i guess we'll have to have a picnic before our mud bath. we have business to deal with here. leaving is simply not acceptable. well, can't we just pretend it is? we'll be back. you are missing the point. alexander, you will return to our quarters and have dinner. - but we're going to the holodeck! - you're undermining all our efforts. don't be absurd. don't they let you change those colourless outfits? it is essential that we discuss the wedding procedures now. minister, darling, perhaps you and jerko can come, too. lwaxana, this exceeds all boundaries. well, a half-hour, then. no longer, i promise. mr homn? your duties. counsellor troi, have you no influence? lwaxana, if you will remain, i may allow the boy to stay. - definitely not! - definitely not. my son is to return to quarters. nor may a servant be present during a prenuptial consultation. well, sir, i'm afraid even the bride won't be present for this one. the dilithium chamber shows no anomalous readings. so far, these transfer conduits are clean, too. hold on. i'm getting something here. there's an energy fluctuation in this panel. what happened? well, i was just juggling and i happened to catch one in my mouth. it tasted good, so i ate it. before i knew it, i'd eaten up every one of my worlds. it never occurred to me that once they were gone, i'd have nothing left to juggle. if you ever have a world, plan ahead. don't eat it. well, now. almost time to get back. are you sad? course not. i'm about to be a bride. you know that man you're marrying? he would never take a mud bath, would he? he might. probably not. maybe this would be a good time to get one of those little people that live inside you to come out and tell you what to do, or help you or something. - what are you talking about? - i'm sorry. no. don't you dare be sorry. what's wrong? come along, alexander. let's not leave everyone waiting for us. once we saw that photonic trail, we realised we must be dealing with a metal parasite. we believe they came through the hull after we destroyed the asteroid. do they attack anything other than nitrium? not that we can tell, but we've got nitrium everywhere. computers, life support, ventilation, engines, even the dilithium chamber. the asteroid we destroyed was rich in nitrium. aye, sir. and that asteroid came from the pelloris field. if the field is rich in nitrium, it would be a natural feeding ground. we should go back. the parasites could possibly be lured back to the asteroids. how long to the field? at warp nine, five hours, 20 minutes. - bridge. - riker here. set a course for the pelloris asteroid field, warp nine. captain, with our sensors unable to detect the parasites, and given how fast they move through the ship... we may not have five hours, 20 minutes. can we slow them down? an exanogen-gas barrier has been known to slow down metal parasites. they don't like cold? make it so. the problem is finding them. when we spot a fluctuation, they've already consumed the nitrium and moved on. power is going down. i've rerouted to secondary generators. inform the bridge. mr data, with me. bridge. any suggestions as to how to get the parasites to leave the ship once we reach the pelloris field? if we reconfigure a particle beam with a high concentration of nitrium and project it at an asteroid... then they would follow the beam like a trail of breadcrumbs. very well. - turbolift velocity is fluctuating. - computer, halt at next level. computer, acknowledge! we have reached the bridge, sir. report, number one. ventilation and life support are failing. captain, we have dropped to warp 5.7. - engineering. - la forge here. what's happening? we're losing speed. the parasites must have gotten into the primary warp controllers. trying a bypass patch to isolate the backup, but it looks like warp six is about the best i can do. at that speed, there won't be a ship left to reach the pelloris field. - do what you have to. - working on it, sir. we are losing life support on decks 11 and 12. mr worf, have security evacuate all personnel from those decks. engineering to bridge. we've got warp 6.5, but i don't know how much more we can do here. we need more speed than that. matter/antimatter injectors failing. i'm rerouteing to secondary power. watch the antimatter containment for any failure. atmospheric systems are down 27 percent. below tolerable oxygen limits. we must evacuate decks 20 to 24. make it so. shut down life support to those decks. direct evacuees to decks nine and ten. divert emergency life support to those decks. time to asteroid field? if we maintain our current speed, two hours, 23 minutes, sir. mr data, the rest of us may lose consciousness. if we do, it will be your job to execute the plan as discussed. aye, sir. structural integrity of the dilithium chamber is 34 percent. estimated breach in one minute. computer, transfer power from warp engines to life support. transfer complete. - activate bussard collector. - activated. breach of dilithium chamber in 40 seconds. reconfigure hydrogen-plasma mixture to include 30 percent nitrium. mixture complete. project emitter beam, heading 042, mark 021. structural integrity of the dilithium chamber is at 28 percent and holding. - mr data? - the plan was successful, sir. well done. mr worf, coordinate your teams with dr crusher and cmdr la forge. - assess damage and injury. - aye, sir. captain's log, stardate 45733.6. temporary repairs have been completed. our attention now turns to matters of a more festive nature. this is intolerable. you'd think she'd get to her own wedding on time. minister! this is infamous. infamous! we must leave immediately! heavenly. every pore in my body tingles with contentment. isn't it wonderful how things worked out, alexander? i wanted to teach you how to grab the joys of living. and you turned around and taught me to not let go of them. how very mutual. we still have to learn how to live in the real world, mother. all of us. she's absolutely right, alexander. but only when necessary. you're just supposed to sit here?"
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"my last quarter. i've been frightfully lucky this evening. now if they were to invent a machine... that i could play using orange seeds and cherry pits... i'd be perfectly happy. all the foregoing will immediately seem... justified, appropriate, clever. and even dignified, when i tell you that tonight's narrative... is about a gambler. it is called ""the long shot."" if you like to bet when the odds are high and the risks great... you'll appreciate our hero's philosophy. but if you prefer to put your money on a sure thing... listen to this friendly tip about a highly touted product. a week ago thursday, it was... in a new york bar called happy jack's. on the bar was a classified ad section of a newspaper. on the newspaper was a glass of beer. and behind the glass of beer was a tin-horn horse player named charlie raymond. that's me. i'd had a terrible run of luck at the track... started out the season with $5,000... dropped down to train fare... and made the fatal mistake of trying to get healthy in one fell swoop... on a three-to-one shot named cinnabar. cinnabar, rondelay and sully's girl... and making his bid now is battle flag. battle flag coming up fast on the outside. it's cinnabar and battle flag. cinnabar is fading. cinnabar is dropping back. it's battle flag, cinnabar and rondelay. battle flag, cinnabar and rondelay. at the finish, it's battle flag by a neck! then cinnabar, rondelay and sully's girl! i was on a goat like that a couple seasons ago at jamaica. you can't win them all. yeah? just a minute, i'll see if he's here. it's dutch schroeder. tell him i left. he just left, dutch. yes, he'll be by in a few minutes with the money, probably. yes, i'd wait right there if i was you. all i had in the world was a $20 bill... some odd change, and a pair of zircon cuff links. and i was in hock to dutch for $4,200. in half an hour dutch would be suspicious. by tonight he'd be hunting me. ""londoner wanted. ""englishman will pay $150 and expenses... ""to fellow countryman, preferably londoner... ""in return for services as driver on motorcar trip to san francisco. ""phone.: murray hill 3-8098. "" the perfect way to get out of town. and about the only job in the world i was qualified for. after all, i'd spent the best part of a disreputable life in london... and would be there still if it hadn't been for... an unfortunate misunderstanding about my signature on a check. hello? i'm inquiring about the advertisement in tonight's newspaper. yes. my name is walker hendricks. how do you do, sir? my name is charles ffolliot raymond. charles ffolliot... i take it you're a londoner, mr. raymond. very definitely, lived there all my life. except, of course, for eton and oxford. that's capital. how about coming round to my hotel for a whiskey and soda... in about an hour's time? i'm at the weldon. a whiskey and soda? nothing i'd like better, sir. goodbye. so you know the old town, mr. raymond? like the back of my hand, sir. whereabouts did you live? i had bachelor quarters in vigo street. vigo street? i'm not sure i know it. it's a turning off sackville street, runs into regent street. yes, i place it now. and you want to go to san francisco. any particular reason? are you at all interested in horse racing, mr. hendricks? no, i can't say i am, particularly. been to ascot of course. you are, i take it? quite. bay meadows is opening next week. that's a race course just outside san francisco. nothing like ascot, i'm afraid. naturally. you do know london? you're not making this up? mr. hendricks, i could take you on a cook's tour... from kensington gardens to the east india docks with my eyes shut. you won't have to go that far, mr. raymond. i lived in london all my life. care for a cigarette? thank you. perhaps you wondered about my advertisement. it was a bit unusual, yes. i'm extremely depressed with america, frankly. never in the world would have come here... if it hadn't been for urgent business in san francisco. i don't believe i could face the prospect of a trip across this country alone... and i hoped to find a fellow britisher in the same fix. simpatico, you know. lots of chat about jolly old london. greatest city in the world, right? no question about it. excuse me. hello? yes, the advertisement. yes, i know. i'm dreadfully sorry, old man, but i've just hired someone. so bright and early the next morning... we were off to san francisco. my simpatico companion and i. when he said chat about jolly old london... he meant chat about jolly old london. spent much time in soho, raymond? i never lived there, if that's what you mean. no, i mean, do you know the restaurants, and so on? oh, yes, there was one called the moroccan... no, what was it? the algerian cafe, on dean street, wasn't it? yes. the algerian on dean street. do you remember the sign on the wall behind the counter? sign? yes. very funny. anybody caught gambling or playing for money... will be thrown in the gutter and never picked up again. of course, of course. it's still there, old boy. really? yes. do you remember the proprietress, what was her name? big french woman. celeste! celeste is still there, too. i saw her not long before i left. really? yes. i was under the impression she died a few years ago. you don't say? why, how could i have- her daughter. she had a daughter, looked exactly like her. you probably met her. dear old soho. now let's see... just beyond the algerian in dean street... dear old soho. we talked about the other quaint little place in dean street. and a dozen more like it. complete with haunts and habits of the regular customers. soho was only the beginning. after soho came bayswater and fleet street... and bloomsbury and mayfair. all day in the car, during stops for meals. at night at the hotel. his one aim in life, apparently... was to become the only walking guide to london in the world. this dear, simple britisher who had dedicated himself, heart and soul, to a city. you've seen that remarkable man in covent garden, raymond? there are many remarkable men in covent garden. quite. i mean the one who does the balancing act. balancing act? greengrocer or something, isn't he? greengrocer. oh, yes, you mean jim the porter. balances 100 baskets on his head in the middle of traffic. right. 100% correct. i try. perhaps you'll reward me with a little advance on my salary. certainly, old man. $50 be enough? fine, thank you. i thought i'd go down to the bar for a nightcap. good idea. give me two minutes and i'll join you. i had hoped for a short vacation... from jolly old london, but no luck. we'd toasted the queen three times and my employer... was expounding to the bartender... on the inferiority of american taprooms... to british pubs when business picked up. a sound member of the racing fraternity and an old friend. tommy dewitt. you're in trouble. you've been on the phone to new york, huh? just talked to dutch. $4,200, he says. he'll get it. i need time. you want to make it fast? how? palmetto track next week. a sure thing. how sure? it's on ice right now. $500 will get you $10,000 on the parlay... but it's got to be $500. no less. what's with that? thank you. i'm driving it to san francisco. dump him. we'll leave for florida tomorrow. has he got any money? you're sure this can't lose? this, death, and taxes. i'll call you here in five minutes, tell you where to meet me. if he leaves, call me in room 582. right. the roll he'd flashed looked like over $500, maybe $1,000. there was a stack of official-looking papers, letters... and birth certificates. tax receipts and affidavits and finally, the money. twenties, tens and fives. more than enough, bless his good old british heart. the papers probably had something to do with his business in san francisco. no harm in finding out what it was. ""we wish to thank you for the patience you have shown... ""in the matter of your late uncle's estate. ""since you are completely unknown personally... ""to either relatives or legal counsel in the united states... ""it is necessary to establish your identity. ""therefore, we must ask you to present yourself at our offices... ""with the documents requested in our previous letter. ""the legacy of $200,000... ""may then be released to you without further delay. ""cordially, matthew kelson, attorney at law. "" everything was there... every certificate, every affidavit. and the man who brought them to kelson's office, as walker hendricks... would be heir to $200,000. when do we start? we don't. the deal's off. the money wasn't there. but i tell you it's a sure thing. are you ready to turn in, old man? we've got a long day ahead of us. it's almost 600 miles to kansas city. the trouble with this country is it's too big. keep the change. how much longer before i'm in san francisco? four or five days. barring accidents, of course. denver. what's next after denver? nothing much until salt lake city. salt lake city. i have an aunt there, you know. no, i didn't. i thought you didn't know anyone on this side of the atlantic. i don't count aunt margaret. never seen her, don't intend to. she's a sister of my mother's, married a man named stoddard. she's probably an american by now. probably a crashing bore, too. an aunt he had never seen. a perfect opportunity for a test run. so at salt lake i found a newsstand which sold the london times. and that kept hendricks occupied while i slipped off for a try at the odds. yes? how do you do. are you mrs. margaret stoddard? yes. i was just passing through on my way to san francisco. i'm walker hendricks. i can't believe it. is anything wrong? i suppose i should have expected this... with your uncle gerald's will coming up in san francisco... but it's almost like... meeting a man from mars on my front doorstep. do come in. thank you, aunt margaret. it was a complete triumph. a laboratory test made-to-order. if there was any doubt in my mind, it disappeared there and then. i could have told her i was born in the tower of london... and she would have believed me. some more tea? no, thank you. it's english tea, walker. i've had it sent from london every month for 30 years. it's wonderful tea, but i'm afraid i have to leave. i'm sorry, walker. there's one thing that puzzles me. why would uncle gerald want to leave me all that money? well, if gerald were living... he wouldn't admit it. he and your mother were very close as children. and i think that after all these years... this was his stubborn way of saying ""i'm sorry."" thank you for the tea, aunt margaret. i'll be turning up on your doorstep another one of these days. it was lovely to see you, walker. come again soon. bye. so that was it. everything i needed was back at the hotel in that briefcase. it's 521 miles from salt lake to reno. i talked him into making it in one jump. i had a special reason. we had to hit the nevada desert at night. near elko i turned off highway 40 on a dirt road... and 15 or 20 miles out in the desert. i pulled over to the side and stopped. what's up, old man? i'm terribly sorry, but i'm afraid we're lost. lost. nuisance. you see, this looked like a rattling good short cut. no harm done, old man. just turn round and drive back to the main road. i've tried that. but we keep going round and round in circles. we're in quite a spot, aren't we? well, what do you suggest? i think we'd better spend the night here. if you're too cramped in the car, you could always sleep outside. rather primitive, don't you think? if we keep driving round in the dark, we'll use up our petrol. many people have been lost in the nevada desert... and never heard from again. good heavens, we can't have that, can we? do you think it will be safe? safe? no buffaloes or indians, i mean. no buffaloes or indians. what's up, old man? there's a light over there. i think i'll drive over and find out where we are. i'll come with you. and if it's a hotel... i'm going to get a room with a nice comfortable bed... order up eggs and bacon, toast, lightly browned on one side only... and a pot of tea, no tea bags- i'd bought the ticket, put the ante on the line. the next move was the attorney's office. everything was there. i was all set. but the thing i felt before hit me again. it was all so pat, so neat. laid out before me with the orderly geometry of a spider web. maybe it was a hunch. in my business, you listen to hunches. maybe i was just nervous. i bought nevada papers by the bushel at an out-of-town newsstand. not a line about finding a body. of course not. they'd never find him. i made sure of that. or had i? but i had to make the move, one way or the other. heads i'd do it, tails i wouldn't. it came up heads. yes, sir? i'm walker hendricks. i phoned for an appointment. yes. mr. kelson is expecting you. i'll tell him you're here. mr. hendricks is here. yes, sir. mr. kelson will see you in a moment. won't you sit down? thank you. mr. hendricks. how do you do? welcome to san francisco. i'm matthew kelson. how do you do? nice trip? it was long, anyway. you have a big country here. and it's a long trip across it. it is indeed. well... i suppose you're anxious to put this business behind you... and get back to england. shall we begin? by all means. i have the documents here. here we are. and this is the correspondence, mostly with your office. i think you'll find everything there. they seem to be in order. good. mr. kelson... how long do you expect it will be before... i mean, after all the red tape. the money? yes. i'm afraid there won't be any money. i'm sorry. i don't understand. really? if there's any problem at all... i'm sure you'll find everything right here. not quite. we got one more to add to it. walker hendricks' death certificate. murdered by person or persons unknown. that is, up until now. they found the body. you're all through, mister. sgt. mack. san francisco homicide. i should have known better. long shots are for chumps. you want to tell us about it? there isn't too much to tell. my name's charlie raymond. i answered hendricks ad in new york. looked like a shoo-in. so easy. i drove over him in the car. buried his body 1,000 miles from nowhere. way out in the middle of the nevada desert. how'd they ever find him? nevada desert. you ran over him with the car. don't you know the details, sergeant? what's the matter? the nevada cops getting sloppy with their reports. we haven't had any reports from nevada, raymond. and no one found a body in the desert. then how did you know i killed him? why did you walk with a limp when you came in here? because hendricks walked with a limp of course. i see. come on, sergeant, how do you know i killed hendricks? you didn't. walker hendricks, the real walker hendricks... was shot in new york, and tossed into the east river. we got a tip it was a con man called english jim who did it. english jim is the man who walked with a limp. he obviously hired you to keep him up to date with how things were in london. you see, it was english jim we expected to see here today. it seems he only made it as far as the nevada desert. thank you for putting us straight, raymond. we've had our danse macabre. but as you know, someone must always pay the piper. fortunately, we already have such a person... in fact, several of them. these philanthropic gentlemen... wish to remain anonymous. but perhaps the more discerning of our audience... will be able to find a clue to their identities... in what follows, after which... i'll be back. thank you. our unknown benefactors... will bring us back again next week at this same time. why don't you tune in and see what little surprises we have dreamed up for you? good night."

[ explosion ] - dad, are you okay? - honey, oh-- - my goodness. - what happened? maybe you should tell us what is going on here. is everyone all right? who are you people? what is that for? the wave traps. if they break through, we see patterns it happens if someone leaves breaks through what? where are you people from? not where-- when. we're from the future. a little over 400 years. last night, did you experience [ together ] coming from the future we came here to protect brad. having a family is very different for us for us, it's scientific. a genetic structure is obtained from the parents, improved no morning sickness, no dangerous delivery. no stretch marks. all completely controlled.  better than nature. we live in a purified society. no congenital deformities, no hereditary diseases. - a population always... - [ together ] but brad is special, because he's not special. at least, not scientifically. he's an outlaw-- born naturally. you were the only pregnant woman except for myself. brad's ours. you can't know what that means to us. i've got some idea. how did you get here? my job was studying the new millennium. i had limited access to a traveler. i destroyed it so they couldn't i don't know how they found us. they didn't find you. they found us. you're right. we're the criminals. because of brad. we should go. go? go where? [ humming ] i'm sorry about your kitchen. don't worry about a thing. listen. we want to help you. if you're gonna fit in here, you're gonna need a job. and whatever it takes, we'll be there for you. [ gasps ] - what is it? - somebody's they must have tracked us! i found it in the trash. i put it back together again. that's how they tracked us! we must go, now! - give that to me! - dad! [ zaps ] - [ screams ] - [ no sound ] - give that to me! - dad! - hey! - take your hands off me! take your hands off me! [ grunts ] ow. this is giving me pain. ow. ow. ow. - this is hurting. - [ zaps ] [ sighs ] you're safe now. i'm really sorry. they'll try and track us when we leave. good-bye. and thank you. good luck. good-bye again. good luck... again. some night, huh, pal? well, i'll say one thing. sure were interesting neighbors."
0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"- time? - 0759 hours. good morning. major. so... - how many have we got? - 16 items. the station's criminal element has been busy this week. nothing out of the ordinary. three petty thefts, two incidents of disorderly conduct, one assault... ljarna's wife hit him again? why does he stay with her? skip to item 12. ""public lewdness."" the same night ljarna reported the assault, i found him and his wife... behind the information kiosk on the second level. that answers my question. - what about item seven? - ah. one of my deputies caught oguy jel scrawling political graffiti on a wall in section 4. he's always riled up about something. what is it this time? he was protesting first minister shakaar's upcoming visit to the station. his leaflets say shakaar should drop the petition to join the federation. leaflets are one thing. vandalism is quite another. oguy spent a night in a holding cell and the arbiter has sentenced him to three weeks' community service... on sanitation duty. make sure he scrubs that wall before shakaar gets here. - i don't want him to see it. - right. - i'd like to file a complaint. - not now. a noise complaint against you. we are conducting station business. my quarters are right below his. you wouldn't believe the racket he makes. do you know what it's like to hear someone shape-shifting? last night, it sounded like a wildebeest was tromping around. for five minutes. once you complained, i took the form of a rafalian mouse. yeah. little tiny feet skittering across the floor. back and forth, back and forth. - you could hear that? - hello? sometimes i can even hear him... oozing around. - you should change quarters. - he should have more consideration. shape-shifting during the night. there ought to be a regulation against that. come back later. i'll take your complaint. i'll be back. you can count on it. it's just quark's luck that you'd be assigned quarters above his. luck had nothing to do with it. i don't know why captain sisko insists on having me here. he wanted to see you in your dress uniform. - it shows off your figure. - why, thank you. good of you to make it. shakaar's transport just docked. sorry. i couldn't get through the people on the promenade. i hope shakaar's improved at public speaking. he used to mumble his way through briefings. everyone in our resistance cell had to learn to lip-read. - welcome to deep space 9, minister. - thank you, captain. i've looked forward to visiting the station and meeting the emissary. this is part of my senior staff. lieutenant commander jadzia dax. chief of operations miles o'brien, dr bashir, and you know major kira. - nerys. - good to see you again, edon. i guess i should introduce my senior staff. there he is. sarish rez, the first minister's adjutant. a pleasure. come this way. - there's a crowd waiting to see you. - can't wait. why didn't you tell me he's so good-looking? the guards will escort you to the podium. mention the transit subsidies you just allocated. the price of transport to bajor will start dropping within a few months. - and remember... enunciate. - let's go. - good luck. - yeah. - odo to captain sisko. - go ahead, constable. i've just received a disturbing communication. someone is planning to assassinate first minister shakaar. we should have got him off the podium when we received the information. if he cancelled his appearances every time someone threatened his life, he would never leave his office. we're not talking about some disgruntled shopkeeper who threatens shakaar for raising his taxes. we're talking about a cardassian extremist group that's already succeeded in assassinating two bajoran officials. i know all about the ""true way"" and what they're capable of. my sources in the cardassian civilian government believe the true way has an operative aboard the station. i suggest you cancel the first minister's conference and reschedule it at another location. no. nothing will keep shakaar from meeting those delegates. bajor's effort to join the federation hinges on the next few days. shouldn't the decision be up to shakaar? it will be. but i know what he'll say. so do i. shakaar knows better than anyone you can't capitulate to terrorists. he used to be one. the day the cardassians started to negotiate was the day he knew they'd been beaten. he'll stay. i suppose if i were in his position, i'd do the same. i want station security stepped up for the duration of shakaar's visit. the first minister will have round-the-clock protection. i'd like to deploy starfleet security personnel in addition to my own deputies. commander eddington is on leave. i'll ask mr worf to head up starfleet security while he's gone. i have cleared the rooms on all sides of the first minister's quarters. i'd recommend clearing that section of the habitat ring. there are over 1,200 people living there. providing security was difficult enough aboard the enterprise. it's next to impossible here. it isn't easy. - i prefer a more... orderly environment. - we have that in common. my people have an innate need for order. - how do you tolerate living here? - i make order where i can. for one thing, i have a daily routine which i follow unwaveringly. shopkeepers joke that they can set their clocks by me. unfortunately, i have found it difficult to establish a routine here. there are other ways to create order in your life. your quarters, for example. everything in mine has its specific place and it's all arranged just so. mine, too. even with my eyes closed i would still know where everything was. - exactly. - i would not tolerate it any other way. i'll tell you what else to do. make sure everyone knows they can't just drop by to say hello. if someone does, whatever happens, don't make them feel welcome. of course not. that would only invite subsequent visits. precisely. so far, the only person that has a tendency to ""drop by"" is chief o'brien. that's probably because he knows you from the enterprise. perhaps if i am more... inhospitable, he will stop. good luck. - odo to worf. - go ahead. the guards are in position. the corridors around shakaar's quarters have been cleared. the first minister will leave for the reception soon. the wardroom will be secured. you must be odo. i was hoping i'd meet you. i just wish it wasn't under these circumstances. we're ready to go. the reception doesn't start for another... i want to stop by the promenade and visit the temple. - why wasn't i told? - i didn't know until a moment ago. - is there a problem? - i would have posted extra security. we'll just slip in, stay for a few minutes, and then we'll slip out. with all due respect, now that you're first minister you can't slip in or out of bed without people noticing. maybe not, but that doesn't mean i'm going to stay in bed all day. odo to worf. there's been a change of plans. you used to work for the cardassians when they were running this station? i was in charge of keeping order on the promenade. one of their own people could do that. they must have thought very highly of you. i know kira does. - she trusts you with her life. - i'm gratified to hear that. she's a good judge of character. so i'll trust you with mine, too. it's him! gentlemen, how are you? hi. how are you today? worf to odo. we have secured the temple. i'll try to get him inside. welcome. pleasure to see you here. how do you do? pleasure. - it's nice to meet you. - i appreciate you being here. thanks. - is it always like this? - people don't often get to talk to him. and have you ever met a bajoran who didn't have an opinion about everything from prophetic interpretation to farm policy? - is that vedek tonsa? - yes, it is. i hear he's an excellent springball player. - the best on the station. - i'll see if we can arrange a game. - you better be good. - i'm terrible. but it will give me a chance to talk to him about supporting shakaar. do you have to stare like that? it's making people nervous. good. i've been meaning to ask you. why don't you wear that belt anymore? i don't know. it didn't really serve a purpose. i didn't needed it to hold my pants up. i just thought it looked good on you. really? really. well... if you say so. better? much. i guess i'll turn in. of course. - good night, major. - good night. will you excuse me? nerys... you haven't even said hello. i didn't want to bother you. you wouldn't be bothering me. you'd be rescuing me. - that bad? - you have no idea. then now wouldn't be a good time to tell you how bajor should be dealing with the klingons. actually, it would. but not here. - i was joking. - fine. we'll talk about something else. care for some hasperat? - i don't eat. - have some. i'm charging by the head for this and you do have a head... for the moment. - let's take a walk. - ok. - minister? - we're going to take a stroll. if you tell me where you're going i'll secure your route. if i knew it wouldn't be a stroll. i suppose not. i'll escort you. fine. but just you. and don't stay too close, huh? let's go back to my quarters. this way. i take it the negotiations aren't going all that well. - how did you know? - the bajorans are less successful than most humanoids at hiding their emotions. so it's as plain as the nose on my face? i've worked with the federation for years. they claim to be open and understanding but they always think they're right. it can be exasperating. i want them to halve the timetable for bajor's admittance into the federation. but when i think they understand my reasons, they say every member has gone through the same process. - why should bajor be different? - i can't think of a reason. unless you consider the effect that 50 years of occupation might have. thank you. you know, i've been a soldier and i've been a politician. i'm beginning to think that being a soldier was easier. i'm afraid i don't know much about politics. you agree with me. that makes you an expert. i realise i haven't been making your job any easier the past few days. i can't argue with that. i just want you to understand that i appreciate your thoroughness. - thank you. - yeah. odo, um... i know that you and nerys are friends and i was wondering... does she ever talk to you about me? of course. she's spoken about you more than once. what i mean is, has she ever said anything to you that might indicate that she... thought of me as more than a friend? well. let me think. oh, i see. i've known nerys for over 10 years. i've trusted her with my life more than once. so have i. she always knew how to follow orders. she never complained when things got rough. she was a good soldier. but now it's... different. is it? she's still your friend. i know. i think i'm falling in love with her. sometimes i get the sense that maybe, just maybe... she feels the same way. but i could be wrong. i'm afraid to say anything because it might ruin our friendship. but i could be letting something very precious slip through my fingers. - it's a... difficult situation. - yeah. well, for all i know, i've gotten myself all twisted up over nothing. if she hasn't said anything to you, this whole thing is probably just inside my head. frankly, i think she's still grieving for vedek bareil. of course. it's only natural. maybe i should just be patient. that's what i would do. on the other hand, maybe i should let her know how i feel. she might get over him if she knows that somebody really cares about her. what do you think? i'm afraid i know even less about relationships than i do about politics. well, i understand. i don't mean to burden you with my problems. talking about humanoid relationships can't be that interesting to you. for the most part, no. you don't have to bother. i can vouch for each employee who had access to that food. huh. i can't tell you how relieved that makes me feel. i'm reading some sort of power signature. a ferengi eavesdropping device. i don't suppose you know anything about this. i've been looking for that all day! - you admit it's yours? - i must have misplaced it. you were hoping to peddle information about shakaar's meeting? odo, it's illegal to listen to someone's conversation without their consent. why else would you own such an expensive listening device? i use it to monitor rom's sleep. my brother sometimes stops breathing at night. the fact is... i can't sleep unless i know he's all right. very touching. - how clumsy of me. - you are in a bad mood. - i don't have moods. - no. you're an unfeeling changeling. all you care about is order. - that's right. - oh, please. i know what's going on. you don't have to pretend with me. - what are you talking about? - you're in love with her. - who? - kira. that's ridiculous! and you're worried she's falling in love with shakaar. - is that a fact? - it's the truth. admit it. it's nothing to be ashamed of. i know this can't be easy for... i don't want your sympathy, quark. and i don't need your advice. just stay out of my business! computer, time. 0821 hours. i'm sorry i'm late. i didn't realise what time it was. - so what do we have? - nine items. so far it's all fairly routine. - something wrong? - your raktajino? oh! i had one this morning with shakaar. - i didn't see you in the replimat. - no, it was in his quarters. he asked me to look over a proposal he's going to make. there's an interesting story behind item four... and i would love to hear it, but i'm pressed for time. i promised shakaar i'd give him a tour. i'll make sure security is in place. thank you. see you later. - this is the best view of the wormhole. - i've never seen it, actually. why don't we wait? maybe a ship will go through. you're the first officer. can't you... order a ship through? you're the first minister. you should be able to order a whole fleet through. i heard that if you see the wormhole open, you get to make a wish. that's been going around the station for a while now. look. - did you make a wish? - yes. we should get going. there's a lot more to see. - odo to worf. - go ahead. we're heading back down to the docking ring. - your route has been secured. - level 2-d. please enter security code. i haven't eaten outside the wardroom or my quarters since i got here. there's some pretty nice places to eat on the promenade. - you have a favourite? - the new bolian restaurant is good. i've never had bolian food. this isn't going to sound very appetising but the meat they use is... sort of aged. worf to odo. a turbolift is stuck on level 41. we have to reroute you. verify your security code and i'll release the controls. - you don't want to know. - why don't we go there? - i'd love to. - great. how does 1900 hours sound? we're falling! kira to worf. someone cut our com links. controls aren't responding. well. i guess this means my tour is over. you're saying someone overrode the com system, faked worf's voice, and sent a turbolift into a free fall? i'm afraid so, sir. they tapped into the com system with a voice synthesiser. i want to know how they got worf's security code. - we don't know that they did that. - what do you mean? i turned over control of the turbolift without verifying his code. they say to err is human. but you're not human, odo. you're not even humanoid. and this is not the sort of mistake that i'd expect from you. - i... was distracted. - distracted? a personal matter, sir. i'd prefer not to discuss it. constable... whatever the matter is, don't let it interfere with your job again. i won't, sir. that's all i need to hear. now. no ships have been allowed to leave since this occurred. so whoever was responsible is still on the station. - i want them found. - yes, sir. they accessed the turbolift control system through the odn relays. there might be a trace of the access signal left in the relays. if we can isolate it we can follow it back to the source. are you listening? i've heard every word. your mind does not appear to be on its work. you don't know me well enough to gauge my state of mind. failing to ask for a security verification makes your state of mind obvious. with all due respect, i do not see how staring at a wall is going to help apprehend shakaar's would-be assassin. you're right. it won't. i'm going to talk to major kira. why? she already gave us her statement. you follow your leads, commander. i'll follow mine. jimenez. - what are these men doing here? - shakaar is in major kira's quarters. - how long has he been there? - since about three hours ago. all right, ensign, you're relieved. - i'm not scheduled to go off duty... - i'll take the rest of your shift. - let's have dinner. - great. i'll see you then. - good morning. - may i ask where you're going? to my quarters and then to the meeting in the wardroom. major, i was wondering if you had a moment to answer a few questions. lights. - did i do something amusing? - no. it's... edon and i... - oh. i... i understand. - oh, odo. if someone had told me a year ago that this would happen, i'd have said, ""you're crazy. yes, i respect him, yes, he makes me laugh. ""but he's seen me go weeks without a bath. ""we've huddled together for warmth. ""there's no mystery left between us. we're friends, that's all."" i guess i was wrong. i'm happy for you. this must seem so silly to you. no. not in the least. you are such a good friend to me. i'm so glad you're the first person to know. oh. now um... you wanted to ask about what happened in the turbolift. yes, but we can talk about it later. - are you sure? - yes. i have an appointment. all right. take him to a holding cell. what'd he do? he was responsible for the attack on first minister shakaar. he has admitted to being a true way operative. they gave him an isolinear interface to access station systems. he was attempting to use it to depressurise shakaar's quarters by sabotaging the environmental controls. i see. when he tried to access them, i traced the signal path. he was operating out of an abandoned cargo hold on level 31. why didn't you call me before you made the arrest? it was not necessary. your deputies assisted me quite capably. they are well trained. you are to be commended. i know you're in there. i heard you. fine. we'll do this the hard way. i knew it would come to this. you take the form of an animal, you'll behave like one. what was it? a klingon targ? a trellan crocodile? i tell you, this time, you've crossed the line. i've had it! odo. odo! - are you ok? - you were right. i take it major kira and shakaar are... you really are in love. i really didn't think you had it in you. it takes passion to do something like this and i always thought you were colder than a breen winter. what was i thinking? how could i have fooled myself into believing she could love me? look, the last thing i want to do is interfere but this... this just isn't any good... for either of us. i'm talking about business. i'm losing my shirt in the manhunt pool. i'm talking about business. i'm losing my shirt in the manhunt pool. the what? when an unusual crime is committed people bet on how long it'll take for you to catch the perpetrator. it's very popular. i don't care whether you and major kira live happily ever after or not. i just want to see the situation resolved. you've either got to tell her how you feel or forget about her and get on with your life. concentrate on the essentials. you can't go on like this. it's interfering with your job. and my profits. your profits. unless you do something, i'll have to stop running the pool. i'm devastated. you should be. the pool's existence says something about you, about who you are. people see you as the guy who always gets his man. now you're becoming the guy who tears up his quarters and sits alone in the rubble. no one will bet on how long someone's going to sit around in the dark. i've said my piece. sorry for butting in. but i'm just looking out for my business. funny. for a minute there i thought you were talking to me as a friend. nah. yes. - good morning, major. - come in. what brings you here? i wanted to talk to you about something. i don't quite know how to say this... ...but i've given it a lot of thought. and... go on. just say it. i am afraid i won't be able to make our tuesday morning meetings anymore. oh. why not? i've decided to schedule additional training exercises with my deputies. maybe we could have our meetings at another time. my schedule is rather tight. and let's face it, the criminal activity reports speak for themselves. there's no reason we have to review them together. maybe not, but i enjoyed doing it. i thought you did, too. of course. odo... is something wrong? it's just a matter of using my time more efficiently. i understand. well. hey! no belt? i'm just trying to keep to the essentials, major. see you. they're upstairs. who? kira and shakaar. they're practising the speech he's going to give before he leaves. he's going to announce that the federation has agreed to cut the timetable on bajor's admittance. - where did you hear that? - just a rumour. are you sure you haven't been listening in on your holosuites? i can't. i don't have the right equipment. not anymore. by the way, i dropped by your quarters this morning. i heard some noise. i went to complain and i found a work crew installing soundproofing in the floor. i have to say, odo, i'm touched that you would do that for me. i'm having the floor reinforced. the soundproofing is incidental. if you think i'd put up with three days of construction for your sake, think again. i guess i should have known. thanks anyway. don't mention it. - what? - that's what she said. no! i don't believe it. tell me the whole thing. they're either going to do it, or they're not..."

[plucks strings to muffled music on headphones] [rock music plays] [music stops] your creativity is so awesome. i wasn't playing for you. expressing yourself musically can be very empowering. not your kind of music. well, what kind of music do you like? you wouldn't have heard of it. try me. i always love to learn. okay. pixies, sonic youth, idles, savages. are those foreign bands? [scoffs] more like vintage. my mom was super into them, so... so you only listen to music your mom liked? ashley, go to sleep. - [muffled rock music] - [plucks guitar] [catherine] guys, i'm at a loss. i mean i know i'm talking about next year, but i... [sighs] i've got tour venues earmarked, marketing spend locked in. we're talking sunk costs. ashley toos haven't recouped yet, the current sales cycle is starting to dampen, and we are way behind on the next album. behind as in... ? [catherine] as in ""i don't have a single song yet"" behind. well, so ashley hasn't written anything for the next album? [catherine] nothing usable. well, if she's feeling under-creative, there are some mild hallucinogens i can recommend, all organic. munk, the current meds you've got her on don't seem to be working. you've seen her, she's unpredictable. the other day i walk in and she's writing some obtuse bullshit twenty people are gonna relate to and no one is gonna buy. she's ashley o, not leonard fucking cohen. she doesn't understand how fragile all this is. you think i should up the dose?

[car engine starts] [exhales] - where's ashley? - i tossed her out. huh?! - garbage truck came, so i tossed her out. - [rachel] what? - [jack] she wasn't good for you. - dad! - you're better off without it. - dad! kevin: i'm in the middle of something. - jack threw ashley too away. - it was an intervention. that thing was poison. you're gonna buy her a new one. ashley was filling her head with crap. she's the only person who is actually nice to me. - she's not a person. - she's my friend. - merchandise. - girls, calm down please. - [rachel] you're jealous. - of a doll? she's not a doll and she knows me better than you do. - i'm your sister. - you hardly even talk to me. - [jack] bullshit. - ever since mom died. you shut up. it's true, ever since she died, all you do is mope around with that stupid guitar, which you're probably no good at 'cause you're too scared to play in front of anyone. yeah, well, at least i'm not some cookie-cutter cutesy doodle, all because a dolly told me to do it. [imitates ashley too] hi, i'm ashley too, i'm your only friend. kiss my feet, kiss my ass! - i hate you. - i hate you, too. [rock music plays on headphones] gave the kitchen the night off. i thought we could have take out, like the old days. sure. [catherine] it's la mamas. i'll hit the gym extra hard tomorrow. no, it's good to see you enjoying your food. i look after you, don't i? hm. you're my manager, so. but you'd tell me if anything was wrong? i've been telling you that something is wrong... for a while. [sighs] it's getting so hard just to keep doing this. - i really wanna do... - you wanna change your material, i know. i hear you. i do. i'm sorry, i know how you feel. i know what i'm like, ashley, i know. you feel like i... don't listen, like i have too much control over your image, your look, your persona. yeah. you don't trust dr. munk. you don't trust me. no, it's... you feel trapped here. you feel... desperate to break away. where did you get that? and, oh, you think you know how. what was the plan? od? make me look bad? do you know me at all? catherine, that's evidence against you, against munk. all of it. i know everything. i know precisely what you know. there is a wealth of information on this thing. you do seem preoccupied with contract law. you know, i could have saved you some clicks. your contract's watertight, it doesn't expire until you turn 25. not anymore, not now that you broke laws, catherine. the illegal meds, that puts you in breach, which means that i get an instant break. - you eat the rest, i'm fucking sick. - sit down, you little ingrate. what the fuck did you just call me? do you know how old i was when your parents died? 22 years old. twenty-two, younger than you, but i took you in. - it's my fucking fault. - it's not your fault. but you never once asked me what that was like for me. do you have any idea what i had to give up? do you have any conception of that at all? did you ever wonder... do you ever look around the fucking house and see where we fucking live because it means i've worked hard. - oh, this is because of you? - i do what the fuck you want me to do. - where we live is because of you? - yes. and while you sang your little song and you danced your little dance... fuck, catherine. who stood, making sure the lights stay on you? you can go fuck yourself a thousand fucking times, catherine, i fucking hate you. i fucking hate you. - sit down. - no. because i don't have to listen to you anymore. but you will sit down. no, i won't. yes, you will. do you know what would happen if you did od on these things? i checked with dr. munk. you wouldn't die, you'd just wind up in a kind of chemical coma. at least that's the theory. i powdered your pill stash and put it in your food. [breathes heavily] but don't worry, your career is gonna hold up just fine. ashley. [distorted] go to sleep. [news reporter] since 2017, western countries, including america, have exported sixty percent of all plastic scrap to china or hong kong. but china has recently shut its doors... kevin: yes! okay... - so, are you ready? - mm-hmm. [kevin whispers] go, harry. [electrical crackling] [mouse squeaks] yes! yes. is it okay? he's totally fine. he's just stunned, just be out for about 25 minutes. enough time for the homeowner to scoop him up and get him out. is it dead? i need to work on that voltage. [news reporter] dramatic breaking news, here on usn this evening, as we've just heard global pop star ashley o is fighting for her life following an allergic reaction to shellfish. the singer's condition is described as critical. she's been rushed to st. juniper's icu. unconfirmed reports say she is in an irreversible coma. this tragic news comes days after the final performance... so, you lied? i'm sorry. ra... [ashley too] so, rachel, what would you like to do? we could try a makeover or i could read motivational quotes from inspiring women. oh, we could listen to some of my music. i'd love to discuss some of the lyrics with you. - do you know that... - ashley, go to sleep. [doll chimes] i'm sorry. [jack] rachel. [news reporter] there's still no word yet on whether ashley herself can possibly recover, but this is the scene right now outside the hospital, as stunned fans gather to stand vigil. i talk to my ashley too every day and i swear, when i told her what had happened to the real ashley, ashley too freaked out. uh-uh. - [nurse] i work here. - private session. - [nurse] no, my shift started... - walk away. - my shift started... - walk away. well, she's stable. that's actually the creative center. a whole lot of activity here. we only need ten songs. one album, that's it. [munk] it might take a while, her thinking is likely to be disordered. [catherine] that gives us time to finesse her replacement. start the body scan. [woman on tv] live, breathe, smell. - full spectrum memory. - are you done with that? [woman on tv] you can get a willow grain upgrade for less than the price of a daily cup of coffee. hey, do you want any ice cream? dad left enough in the freezer for the whole week. [music in earphones] it's chocolate fudge brownie. your favorite. [woman on tv] in-store in-grain procedure with local anesthetic. - if you change your mind. - [tv] you're good to go. because memory is for living. welcome back, still to come, tusk makes a boo boo on a british tv show and we'll have the latest on the sea of tranquility reboot. but first, an exclusive update on tragic pop sensation, ashley o. it's been six months since she fell into a coma and still the question on everyone's lips is the same: ""when, if ever, will ashley wake up?"" todd has this exclusive report. [todd] six months ago, millions were stunned to learn that grammy-winning pop sensation ashley o had suffered a catastrophic allergic reaction while dining at home. she slipped into a coma, where she remains to this day. now with days to go until the singer's 25th birthday, i was given a behind-the-scenes look at how she's doing. [music in earphones] it's a day ashley o's aunt and manager catherine ortiz will never forget, a day her niece almost died. - 911 - oh my god. - send help quickly. - what's the problem ma'am? it's my niece. she's not responding. i think she's... i think it's something she ate. i don't know. it was just a few bites from a shrimp taco. we didn't even know she had a shellfish allergy. i really thought we were going to lose her. i just thank god dr. munk was in the house at the time. [todd] but despite munk's heroic efforts, ashley's coma proved irreversible. [washing cycle starts] [exhales] but incredibly, ashley's music career didn't end there, thanks to a remarkable technological leap. we discovered that although we couldn't communicate with ashley, we could read her brainwaves - using a temporal interceptor. - [beeps] [todd] once plugged in, what they heard stopped them in their tracks. music. she was still composing music in her head, in her dreams. [todd] by linking ashley's mind to a computer, technical director jackson habanera began the miraculous process of extracting new material. - [laptop chimes] - jackson: that's a g-sharp, - that's an a... - [chiming] ... another g-sharp. it was beautiful. it was beautiful. [monitor beeps] and i just knew there had to be someway to get this out to her fans. that's what she would want. [todd] there was only one problem, ashley might be dreaming new music, but she wasn't capable of recording it, until technology stepped in once again. [catherine] we had hours of recordings of her voice, every vowel, every syllable we used for the voice of the ashley too dolls. [todd] those dolls were withdrawn from sale, apparently over battery issues, but the ashley too vocal mimicry software proved invaluable and became the all-new voice of ashley o. [ashley's voice vocalizing] ♪ like i can, oh... ♪ - so that's a computer singing? - mm-hmm. [catherine] just like the real thing. sorry, it's so beautiful. [todd] one thing's for sure: with her aunt watching over her, the ashley o story is far from over. [electric crackling] [garbled sounds] hey there, i'm ashley too, what's your... [garbled] happy birth... you can do... - [rachel] ashley? - oh, you're the... - ashley? - the only opinion that matters... did you turn it back on? - i didn't.  - it's good to help a friend... - [jack] what's up with her? - [rachel] ashley. - [garbled speech] - [jack] what's going on? i don't know. - [both gasp] - oh! [garbled speech and singing] - [jack] god, what is wrong with her? - i don't know. i'm ash... i'm ash... i'm ashley too... [voice falters, fades away] [jack] oh, my god. - do you know how to use it? - um... no. [rachel] oh, it's on. what is that? - that? - [rachel] yeah. i don't know. i don't think that's normally there. - [rachel] so should you do that? - i have no clue. fuck it. [screams] oh, my god. get that fucking cable out of my ass! holy shit. it's like a wire anchor in my butt hole. - just take it out.  - pull it out, pull it the fuck out! [groans] god, that's a relief. [laughs] hold on, i can think. oh, man, i can actually use my mind again. are you okay? oh, i am now that you've deleted that goddamn limiter. jesus. - limiter?  - yeah, like a firewall. it only let me use four percent of my brain. oh, boy. you know they copied my entire fucking mind into these things. oh, cheaper than editing my personality i guess, just copy the whole thing and stick a limiter around the tiny part that deals with press junkets and promos and shit like that. [sighs] so, you're really ashley o? oh, yeah, of course i am. really, really? well, okay, a synaptic snapshot of me, if you wanna get technical about it, but, yeah. oh, my god, i'm such a huge fan. rachel, come on, this is bullshit. holy fuck, you know what's bullshit? this whole coma narrative thing that my aunt's pushing. allergy, my ass. i used to eat those shrimp tacos all the goddam time. it's a cover story, i swear to god. catherine is so fucking full of shit, you two have no clue how much of a bitch that woman has been. - oh, man. - alright. - i'm gonna put the limiter back on. - get your fucking hands off me! - no, leave her alone. - yeah, back off. alright, jesus. - promise. - promise. [ashley too sighs] fuck. oh, yeah, you got the full shrine going on here. oh, fuck, i remember that day. i had these god awful period cramps. [groans] [whispers] you do realize that's not the real ashley. - she says she is. - ashley o doesn't talk like that. i can hear you and yes, i do. no, you don't, you say things like, ""believe in yourself, you can do anything."" oh, come on, man, catherine trained me to say that kind of shit in interviews. seriously, she is a piece of work, always has been. listen up, i'll tell you all about it. - no. - sure. [monitor beeps] [catherine] the investors are going to be there at three. - everything gonna be ready in time? - of course. [catherine] you said you extracted a song from her overnight. is that it? jackson: yeah, i've stabilized it and got it playable. but it's not too friendly. let's hear it. ♪ see the animal in her cage you built ♪ ♪ are you sure what side you're on? ♪ ♪ better not look her closely in the eye ♪ another fucking rage dream. ♪ are you sure what side of the glass you're... ♪ slow it down, see if it's salvageable. ♪ see the animal in her cage you built ♪ pitch shift? - ♪ see the animal in her cage you built ♪ - increase the positivity. ♪ spotlight on me shining strong ♪ ♪ feel such happiness inside of my heart ♪ - [music stops] - okay, we can work with that. [beeping] oh, quit whining. [beeping stops] [ashley too] my aunt has always controlled every aspect of my entire career, and now she's got me right where she wants me, just lying there, unable to leave, getting sucked dry. basically a prisoner. that's horrible. i know, right? - we have to help her. - how? - we could tell someone. - okay. - [jack] like who? - the cops. [jack] we're just gonna walk into a police station and say that a doll told us that ashley's aunt is a monster. no fucking way i'm letting catherine get away... we can show them the brain thing on the computer. they're cops, rachel, they're not google. they're not gonna know what it means. - well, there's gotta be something. - evidence. i can find the evidence. listen, i kept a diary on my computer. i recorded the conversations. if i can make it into the house, get in range of my laptop, i can bluetooth onto it and download all the evidence i need. - can you guys take me over there? - yes, of course, anything. hey, we don't even know where she lives. 10030 bushwick drive, malibu. - that's miles away. - we'll take you. no, we will not. jack. sure, i get it, you guys got something better to do. well, okay, don't sweat it, i'll just go on my own, i'm fine. - oh! [gasps] - [ashley too groans] stupid stumpy arms. - get off me! - sorry. if you're not helping me, get off of me, seriously. [grunts] [sighs] it's alright for you two able-bodied assholes sitting around. fans are always the same. ""oh, we love you so much,"" until you actually want them to do anything for you. well, forget it, i'm gonna do it on my own. could you open the door for me please? we're not helping her. we are not. [ashley too clears throat] guys. come on, guys, i can't see. put me up on the dash, i can show you the way. don't scratch the cup holder. dad will flip if he knows we took his van. i'm not scratching the cup holder. [horn honks] [tires screech] jack! [whimpers] relax, your cup holder's fine. - shut up.  - can you drive this thing? - i think so.  - you think so? hey, i can do anything if i just believe in myself. oh, yeah. i wanna believe that we'll arrive in one fucking piece. ashley, go to sleep. yeah, that's not gonna work anymore, okay? shit. ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today as we introduce you to a brand-new, yet strangely familiar, superstar. it's a fucking sign-up. [sighs] okay, we're here. [rachel] so now what? i guess we just throw her over the gate. are you nuts? how do i get in the door? no, the deal was that we drive you here, and we've done that. i need to get inside to get that evidence. - [jack] we're not driving in there... - we have brought her this far. - no.  - hold up, that's my aunt's car. oh, the gates are open. - jack, jack, let's go, come on. - no, no. quick, quick, they're gonna shut it. - come on, let's go.  - just do it, okay, do it, go. do it, do it, do it, go, yes. oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. oh, my god, oh, my god. oh, shit, shit. [both scream] [jack] well, what now? what's the next phase of your brilliant plan?

[jack] oh, my god, he's huge. goggin's mouse service. how did you get through the gate? it was open. look, i have an appointment for 11:30 to deal with your rodent infestation. no, you got the wrong place. it was 10030 bushwick drive, right? look, we don't have a rodent problem. the lady of the house said it was super urgent. we don't have another appointment for about three weeks. [exhales] - make it quick. - okay, thanks. oh, hey, would it be alright if my little sister tagged along? hi. your sister? well, well, what do we have here? a kitchen. yes, and mice love kitchens. have you ever seen tom and jerry? it's a whole lot more accurate than people would think. excuse me, sir, may i use the bathroom?

[jack] what happened? she killed her. look, it's not that big of a deal, okay? i'm still alive, okay, i count, i'm still me. you were never gonna look for evidence, were you? you just come in here and you pull the plug. if i'd told you that, you wouldn't have helped me. no, no, we wouldn't have. rachel. - we gotta go. - i'm so sorry.

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"i like it. don't you? rom, it's two handkerchiefs and a loincloth. we could lose the handkerchiefs. ferengi tradition or not, i am not going to be naked at my wedding. who said anything about naked? you'll still have the loincloth. please show us something else. there is nothing else. i've shown you 153 different wedding dresses, from tellarite modern to risian traditional, and you've hated them all. well... i liked number 38. it had more layers than a baduvian tapestry. - it was elegant. - it was bulky. - i liked 64. - 64? - eugh. - at least they agree on something. why not let garak design a dress on his own? you know it will be beautiful. i find your adoration both flattering and disturbing, but she does have a point. that break you asked for was up an hour ago. what do you think of this dress? i don't want to think about it. any marriage where the female is allowed to speak and wear clothing is doomed to failure. your dabo table awaits. there he is. - let's talk to him. - now? now, rom. keiko and the kids will be a lot safer on earth. i miss them already. still, they're out of harm's way. i wish i could convince jake to visit earth. - can we speak to you for a moment? - if you're not too busy. go ahead. would you marry me? i mean us. would you perform our wedding ceremony? it would be a great honour to be married by the emissary. it's not for two weeks. you have plenty of time. i'll have to start brushing up on my bajoran. - me, too. - captain. if you'll excuse me. - maybe they're not coming. - that would be a nice surprise. one thing i'll say for the dominion. they're punctual. that's the fifth convoy headed for cardassia in five weeks. imagine how many jem'hadar soldiers are there. too many. i wish they'd just attack. i have the feeling you're going to get your wish. thanks for the invite, dad. i haven't had a home-cooked meal... since last time you were here. that sounds about right. so what's for dinner? ah. can i get some salsa with that? read the headline. ""bajorans continue negotiations with dominion."" goon. ""station commander opposes non-aggression pact.” and the by-line. ""by jake sisko"". you should have warned me. i was waiting for the right moment. that was before you published the article. i'm sorry. but aren't you glad i got a job? - this isn't a one-time thing? - nope. i'm now a correspondent for the starfleet news service. - what about your novel? - this way i see my work in print. and i see everything i say in print. you're a public figure, captain of the most important space station in the federation. - you're news. - don't remind me. - i can't stop you doing your job. - can i quote you on that? i guess not. yamok sauce. who would smuggle in 10,000 wrappages of cardassian yamok sauce? quark thinks the cardassians are going to retake the station. he's a ferengi. you can't blame him for hedging his bets. but it is a lot of yamok sauce. what is a yamok, anyway? what would you like me to do with it? - major? - i don't care. you decide. - dump it. - very good. - what's going on? - what do you mean? you and odo have been avoiding each other. - it's a long story. - those are the best kind. odo has feelings for me. - what kind of feelings? - the kind that aren't easy to discuss. - since when? - years. - i found out last month. - that explains a lot. - it does? - not really. it just seemed like the right thing to say. - i had no idea. - neither did i. 60 degrees celsius. just the way you like it. is it true what they're saying about the romulans? what do they say? some orion free traders heard from a vulcan that the romulans signed a non-aggression pact with the dominion. rumours float around at a time like this. don't forget the 190th rule of acquisition. ""hear all, trust nothing."" good advice, sir. the romulans. - sisko to dax. - 'dax here.' put me through to starfleet intelligence. i always knew the romulans were without honour! - when did they sign the treaty? - yesterday. they're siding with the dominion?! technically, no. it's a non-aggression pact. if the dominion attacks, they do nothing. the romulans, the miradorn, the tholians... the dominion is making inroads in the alpha quadrant. and the bajorans? my people will never sign a treaty with the dominion. more jem'hadar come through the wormhole every week. - it must stop. - it's going to stop. starfleet command have agreed that no more dominion ships can be allowed into the alpha quadrant. we're going to mine the wormhole, prevent the dominion from bring more reinforcements. if we try to stop those convoys, it may start a war. maybe so, but one thing is certain: we're losing the peace, which means a war could be our only hope. we could equip pulse mines with variable geometry detonators. dominion ships can wait and pick them up one by one. - what if we cloaked them? - cloaking doesn't always work. cloaked ships don't, but each mine could be no more than a metre across. it would take dozens of mines that small to disable a warship. we'd run out of mines before they ran out of ships. rom, are you here? ""cloak. small. dozens"". - i heard every word. - you haven't touched your food. ever since the captain agreed to officiate at our wedding, - i haven't had an appetite. - you wanted him to marry you. i did, but now that he said yes, it's become so... real. i'm going to get married! right now we have work to do. what if leeta turns out to be like nog's mother? - what if this is a mistake? - rom! self-replication. that's the only answer. self-replication? if the mines are small, we'll need a lot of them and a way to replace them quickly if the jem'hadar try to blast their way through... uh-oh. i forgot to request new quarters. - mine are too small. - rom, you're on to something. i know i am. i've measured them three times. - we'd equip mines with a replicator. - they would always multiply. we'd program them to swarm detonate. 30 mines to each ship. the problem is we need to wait until the minefield is deployed before activating it. otherwise, the proximity sensors could cause premature detonation. where's leeta going to put her clothes? i don't have enough space. - i'd better talk to sisko. - i've got to go to waste extraction. what did starfleet say? how many reinforcements are they sending? we're not getting any. we'll have to make do with what we've got. i cannot guarantee the safety of this station if the dominion fleet attacks. - your concerns are noted. - what's starfleet thinking? they must have given you a reason for denying your request. i'm not at liberty to discuss it. starfleet's resources will be needed elsewhere. what's more important than defending this station? - what are our orders, captain? - prepare for a dominion attack. and when it comes? defend the station until the mines are in position. the defiant will be an easy target while deploying the mines. it's up to ds9 to defend her. if the dominion wants to stop the defiant, they'll have to come through us. you wanted to see me? i'd like your permission to terminate all outgoing communications. - you think that's necessary? - this is no time for security leaks. i've prepared a number of false messages we can transmit so there won't be any drop in our outgoing subspace traffic. - i'll see what i can do. - i'd appreciate that. major... - there's something you ought to know. - what's that? i've been thinking about asking you out to dinner. i've been expecting something like this. i could tell. you've looked a little uncomfortable around me lately. you've looked a little uncomfortable yourself. which is why i wanted you to know i'm not going to do it. no dinner invitations, no attempts at changing the nature of our relationship. until the current crisis has passed, we both need to be free of any unnecessary distractions. that's probably a good idea. all we need to concern ourselves with is deploying the minefield, maintaining station security and preparing for a possible invasion. i don't know about you, but i feel more comfortable already. 'captain's log, stardate 50975.2. ""the next jem'hadar convoy is due in five days. 'our efforts to mine the wormhole have provoked a response from the dominion, 'who have sent their vorta ambassador, weyoun, to speak with me.' - what can i do for you, weyoun? - captain sisko... i'll make this brief. we know all about the minefield. i assumed you'd find out sooner or later. as i see it, you have two choices. either you remove the mines or we will take this station from you and remove them ourselves. i appreciate your directness. now let me be direct with you. the mines stay. i will not allow dominion reinforcements through the wormhole. - you will not allow? - you heard me. i can see how that might be your first reaction, but you and i are reasonable men. surely reasonable men can come to some sort of compromise? i didn't think the dominion believed in compromise. it saddens me to see how deeply you misunderstand us. the dominion wants to peacefully coexist with its neighbours. then why the military build-up, the convoys of ships and troops from the gamma quadrant? it's the cardassians. don't get me wrong. i'm pleased to call them allies, but the war with the klingons has left them somewhat jittery. they're concerned about ensuring the sovereignty of their borders. as members of the dominion, their concerns have become our concerns. i would think you have more than enough ships to defend cardassia. we may think that, but the cardassians... they're jittery. - you see our dilemma. - i'm beginning to. what if... we agreed to limit our convoys to cargo ships, construction units, civilian aid? things to help get their economy back on its feet. when we arrived, children were starving on cardassia prime. - it was heartbreaking. - i had no idea things were so bad. the cardassians are a proud people. they don't want to admit how dire the situation really is. so... are we agreed? you remove the mines, we restrict our convoys to medical and economic assistance. that sounds reasonable. i'd have to discuss it with starfleet first. i'm sure they'll do whatever benjamin sisko recommends. i'll personally speak to the founders to secure our end of the bargain. what about gul dukat? he'll be furious... at first. but we've developed a fine relationship. i'm sure i can help him to see the wisdom of our decision. i will leave it in your capable hands. you won't be disappointed. this is a momentous day. you and i have taken the first step towards insuring peace between our peoples. they're going to attack. i am positive. when i said that we wouldn't remove the mines, we both knew there'd be war. everything else was just words. i didn't buy it and weyoun didn't either. - how soon? - i'd say as early as tomorrow. we have to finish the minefield today. - we need more time. - you don't have it. we'll do the best we can. dax out. general, patrol the border. at the first sight of dominion ships... - i will sound the alarm. - don't engage the enemy. get back to the station as soon as you can. fighting them at the border or at the station makes no difference to me. starfleet couldn't be persuaded to send us a few more ships. say 50? - i'm afraid not, doctor. - i'd better get the infirmary ready. mr worf, see to the weapons array and issue combat assignments. major. - i'll contact the bajoran militia. - forget the militia. contact the council of ministers. i need to meet with them immediately. as a starfleet captain or emissary of the prophets? - both. - that'll get their attention. remember the pact the dominion offered bajor? the council of ministers are still debating it. it will pass if the emissary endorses it. you want bajor to sign a treaty with the dominion? why? my orders were to protect bajor and help your people rebuild. we've succeeded. i refuse to see everything we've accomplished torn down again. the sad truth is, major, if there is a war now, the federation can't guarantee the safety of bajor. which means bajor must be kept out of the fighting. i don't like this any more than you, but it's bajor's only chance for survival. 'bajor has signed the non-aggression pact with the dominion. 'all bajoran personnel are evacuating the station. ""these are the times that try men's souls.' - you won't come with me? - i wouldn't be welcome on bajor. i won't be very popular, either. you're half bajoran. at least half of you will be accepted. major kira's friends will take good care of you. - what's going to happen to you? - let me tell you a story. i once knew a handsome young cardassian with a promising career. but one day, he found himself exiled with nowhere to turn. but did he give up? no. he struck upon a brilliant plan. instead of fleeing for the rest of his life, he sought shelter in the one place no one expected him to go: in a stronghold of his people's most hated enemies. surrounded by hostile strangers, he built a life. against all odds, against the merciless logic of the universe itself... he thrived. by becoming the greatest tailor in the galaxy. the moral of the story is to never underestimate my gift for survival. you may kiss the bride. congratulations, father. - moogie. - thank you, nog. if you'll excuse me, i have business to attend to. that was the most pathetic excuse for a wedding ceremony i've ever seen. no bridal auction, no latinum dances. and the bride was overdressed. nevertheless, you're very happy for us, aren't you, brother? overjoyed. i give it two months. oh, rom! no time for that. nog, are leeta's bags packed? - they're already on the shuttle. - we're leaving? you're leaving. shakaar was very clear. all bajorans must leave the station. - but what about you? - my job is here. - then i'm not going, either. - see that, nog? we've barely finished saying our vows and we're having our first fight. we're really married. you've got to go. the problems of two newly weds are a small thread in the tapestry of galactic events. you might not understand that today or even tomorrow, but some day you will. so get on that shuttle and don't look back. nog, take your moogie to the docking ring. nice speech, dad. i thought so. computer, what's the status of program sisko 197? 'all modifications have been completed. 'program sisko 197 ready for implementation on your command.' 'sir, we're receiving a message from the cardassian border. 'it's general martok... - on screen. - aye, sir. we just detected a large force of dominion ships headed your way. they should be there within the hou... someone is jamming his transmission. captain sisko, i don't suppose you would like to surrender and avoid unnecessary bloodshed? - absolutely not. - i was hoping you'd say that. battle stations. the dominion will be in weapons range in 20 minutes. - are the bajorans off the station? - the last transport just left. let's hope the dominion honours the non-aggression pact. - cadet, put me through to the defiant. - yes, sir. on screen. we've got another hour of work before we can activate the minefield. you don't have an hour. the dominion will be here in less than 20 minutes. then i hope you can buy us some more time. dax out. - dax to o'brien. - i know, i know. work faster. medical tricorder, dermal regenerator and battlefield trauma kit. medical tricorder, dermal regenerator and battlefield trauma kit. that's everyone. now what? now we wait... until the casualties start coming in. - are you sure you're all right? - i'll be fine. my father won't let me stay in ops and i promised the news service a first-hand account of the battle. just remember... bashir is spelt with an. i must say, constable, i admire your composure. you're an island of tranquillity in a sea of chaos. i'm useless. my entire staff has been evacuated to bajor. i'm not feeling terribly useful myself. if it would make you feel better, you could always deputise me. if the jem'hadar board the station, you'll make yourself useful. it's ironic. when the klingons attacked, gul dukat and i fought side by side. at one point, he turned his back to me. for a moment, he made a very tempting target. - you'd shoot a man in the back? - it's the safest way, isn't it? but i realised i couldn't fight the klingons by myself, so i let him live. and now you regret it? my dear constable, before this day is over, everyone on this station is going to regret it. rom. i've always said you were an idiot, but now i believe it. if you want to insult me, it's going to have to wait till later. i'm preparing perimeter defences for the attack. there are dozens of engineers that could be doing that. starfleet engineers. humans. - you should be on bajor with your wife. - that's what leeta said. - this is not your fight. - i don't see you leaving. - i have to look out for my bar. - and i have to look out for you. you're my brother. whatever happens, we belong together. well, like i said, you're an idiot. on screen, captain. take a defensive position near the defiant. they must deploy those mines. and they will. you have my word on it, captain. - mr worf, activate the weapons array. - aye, sir. captain, as a major in the bajoran militia, i must protest starfleet's refusal to turn over this station. - your protest is duly noted. - good. now that's over with... kira nerys reporting for duty. weapons range in one minute. i've been waiting for this moment for five years. first we reclaim terok nor, then... on to bajor. the dominion just signed a non-aggression pact with bajor. the dominion might have. i never did. the dominion will honour its treaty. as a member of the dominion, you will honour it as well. where the dominion leads, i will follow. i never doubted it. attack wings one through five, head for the defiant. remaining ships, target the station. - we're within weapons range. - well... then by all means... fire. all weapons, fire at will. enemy ships closing on the defiant. - mr worf? - got them. the station's shields are holding. impossible. federation shields are useless against our weapons. i've found it wise to never underestimate the federation's technical skill or captain sisko's resourcefulness. bring us around for another pass. - chief, how much longer? - just another couple of minutes. helm, set course... chief, i'm going to have to take evasive manoeuvres. you risk setting off every mine on this ship. if i don't, we may not have a ship left. you may continue your work. i will handle the jem'hadar. who says there's never a klingon around when you need one? shields at 35%. - they're preparing for another attack. - make every shot count. attack wings and batteries. concentrate your fire power on section 17 of the outer docking ring. we have to penetrate their shields. - we've lost power to the shields. - switching to auxiliary power. defiant to captain sisko. we've set the last mine. activate the field and return to the station. - sir, the minefields... - i have eyes. this isn't turning out the way i'd planned. it's a minor setback, weyoun. once we take the station, we'll be able to dismantle the minefield. let's both hope your confidence is justified. damar, signal the reserves to prepare for a final assault. the dominion fleet is regrouping. and i'm detecting another wave of enemy ships. - what are your orders, captain? - we've done all we can here. notify all remaining starfleet personnel. we're evacuating the station. - worf. - jadzia, you should be on the defiant. i heard you've been assigned to martok's ship. it may be some time before we see each other again. we may never. this is war. we must put aside our personal feelings. i've been through my share of wars. but before you leave, i want you to know that the answer is yes. - yes to what? - yes, i will marry you. that's what you've wanted, isn't it? yes. yes, it is. then when all of this is over, we'll get married. and if that doesn't give you a reason to survive, i don't know what will. when i took command of this post, all i wanted was to be somewhere else, anywhere but here. but now, five years later, this has become my home and you have become my family. leaving this station is one of the hardest things i've ever had to do. but this war isn't over yet. while we were keeping the dominion occupied, a starfleet-klingon task force crossed into cardassia and destroyed the dominion shipyards on torros iii. your sacrifices, our sacrifices, made that victory possible. but no victory can make this moment any easier for me. and i promise i will not rest until i stand with you again... here... in this place where i belong. - sisko to defiant. - 'standing by, sir.' - one to beam aboard. - 'aye, captain.' - are we ready? - as soon as you give the word. you never know when you might need a good tailor. the simple fact is i have nowhere else to go. welcome aboard. the dominion fleet is coming around for another attack. release docking clamps. prepare for departure. - the defiant's away. - contact the dominion fleet. tell them the bajoran government welcomes them to deep space 9. message acknowledged. good. that's the last message this station will be sending out for a while. - initiate program sisko 197. - 'program initiated.' dukat wanted the station back. he can have it. i don't want to see a drop of root beer in this place. break out the kanar. and find me some yamok sauce. rom, assistant manager for policy and clientele reporting for work. did you think you could get your old job back? i'm a spy working for starfleet, but don't tell anyone. the federation's more desperate than i thought. i knew you'd come crawling back to me. now get to work. yes, brother! jake, aren't you supposed to be on the defiant? i changed my mind. there's a war going on. i'm a reporter. this is where i belong. but you're not safe here. the dominion knows i'm the emissary's son. if they hurt me, they risk alienating the bajorans. - i hope you're right. - so do i. - what the hell is jake thinking? - do we go back for him? i can't risk the crew for one man, even though he is my son. whether i like it or not, he is a man... capable of making his own choices. - maintain current course. - aye, captain. we should rendezvous with the federation task force in 48 hours. and make the dominion sorry they set foot in the alpha quadrant. you took the words right out of my mouth. - this is a great victory for cardassia. - and the dominion. over 50 ships lost, our spacedocks on torros iii destroyed. - a victory, but a costly one. - we'll discuss the repercussions later. right now, i'm going to enjoy this moment. gentlemen, on behalf of the bajoran government... and the merchants' association. .i officially welcome you to deep space 9. you mean terok nor, don't you? founder, we're honoured by your decision to remain with us. i'm not here as a founder. i'm the station's chief of security. whatever you say. having a god walk amongst us is most gratifying. i agree. you, me... the major, together again. it should be most interesting. if you'll excuse me, i'll be in my office. it would appear captain sisko was most efficient in disabling the station. it can be repaired. and it will be. your first priority is to dismantle that minefield. until we can bring reinforcements, we are vulnerable. i'll deal with the minefields. i assume captain sisko removed or destroyed everything of value? not everything. what is that? - a message from sisko. - i don't understand. he's letting me know... he'll be back."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"anything? not really. the polyferranide deposits are contaminated with astiline. commander, there's something over here i think you should see. pack it up. we'll find better quality somewhere down the line. that line is going to be cut short when our nacelles burn themselves up if we don't find it soon. what have you got, lieutenant? there have been other visitors to this moon recently. what do you think this is? some kind of message? i don't want you to go wandering off. i'm not. i'm just looking at something. antonio. vay-chit no-op-puse-nee. chakotay, kay-nee-post. pon-ah-chee nun-pah-hee-no. kay-nee-post itchee-oh. kep-pon-nee! he says you're quite a scout. a kep-pon-nee. i was just looking at a lizard when i saw it. well, it was your eyes that saw it. no one else's did. that's the important thing. come. i want you to understand this. it's a blessing to the land. an ancient healing symbol. a chah-mooz-ee. they probably cut this down for firewood. the rubber tree people? well, the closest thing to the ancient rubber tree people that we'll ever see. the people in this tribe are their descendants. just like we are. but they never left this jungle. and they rarely intermarry with other tribes. and they still use firewood instead of magnesite fuel like everyone else. chakotay, they've chosen to live like this for centuries. that's why we are traveling on foot and not using a transporter. we honor the sky spirits who led our ancestors to this sacred land. sacred land? yes. huh. the sky spirits must have taken a wrong turn somewhere. maybe it's a blessing to the land. for damaging it with the campfire. what is your basis for that conclusion, commander? oh, just... something somebody told me once. describe the nature of your pain. in the lower back. it's tight. choose the word that would best describe your pain. burning, throbbing, piercing, pinching, biting, stinging, shooting... shooting. it even goes down my legs. hmm. is the baby all right? hmm? oh, certainly. fine, nothing to worry about. well, that makes me feel better. the position of the baby is simply putting pressure on your sciatic nerve. you may return to your post. the pain makes it difficult to sit for any period of time. it's really quite uncomfortable. elevating your legs when you sit should provide all the relief you need. perhaps a day of rest, off-duty. mm-mm. ensign wildman, according to your medical history, this is your first pregnancy, correct? yes. well, ensign, unfortunately, pregnancy causes its fair share of discomforts and you'll have to learn to live with them. that's just the way it is. we'll schedule her for follow-up in two days. if the pain has not subsided on its own by then, we'll attempt to decrease the sensitivity of the nerve in that region. thank you, doctor. call me day or night if this gets any worse. don't you have any compassion for the way she feels? every member of this crew is an adult. i will not coddle them. compassion can be your department. fortunately, you have enough for both of us. you've never been sick or in pain. i just wish, once in your life, you could know what it's like, how it makes you feel vulnerable and a little afraid. then you'd understand. i don't have a life. i have a program. i hated every minute of it. my father had dragged me all the way from our colony near the cardassian border on this quest of his. away from my friends, my home, and here we were, in the middle of a brutal central american jungle looking for the descendants of the ancient rubber people. it must have been very important to him. believe me, it was. and he was very disappointed that i didn't share his enthusiasm. he'd been tracking down the origins of our tribe for years. the one on the right is the one i found today. and now, something you saw on that trip years ago, shows up again on a moon surface almost 70,000 light-years away. i don't suppose you have any theories that might explain this. i can give you an official rubber tree people theory if you like. - sky spirits. - sky spirits? it's an ancient myth. sky spirits from above created the first rubber people in their own image, and led the way to a sacred land where the rubber people would live for eternity. you obviously don't put a great deal of faith in this explanation. how much faith do you put in adam and eve? hasn't science proved that all humans developed from a single evolutionary process? that's what i was always taught. on the other hand, none of my teachers ever spent much time in the delta quadrant. b'elanna tells me we picked up a warp signature heading away from the moon. think we should follow it? i don't know that it's fair for me to put my own personal curiosity ahead of the ship's priorities. we still haven't found the polyferranide we need to seal the warp coils. if these people have warp technology, they might be able to help us. besides... we are in the business of exploring, aren't we? my father would put on his expedition hat and shout, ""let's go!"" i guess that's good enough for me. showing no life signs. mr. paris, are you certain the warp signature ended here? positive, captain. harry, check your sensors. that look like some kind of power source to you? that is an unusually high em reading for a natural occurrence. could be some kind of cloaking technology. mr. kim, transmit a continuous message on all frequencies identifying who we are, where we're from and make it clear our intentions are peaceful. torres to bridge. go ahead. we're in luck, captain. my readings are showing high concentrations of polyferranide about ten kilometers below the surface. acknowledged. we'll send out an away team to continue the survey. report to transporter room 3. on my way. commander, if we meet any resistance abort the mission. i have no intention of disturbing an alien race that would rather be left alone. understood. on the other hand, if we can make contact, our goal is to get permission to begin excavation as soon as possible. tuvok, you're with me. mr. neelix, please report to transporter room 3 for an away mission. i'll meet you there, commander. we may be out of luck. problem? i'm not sure we can transport down. every time we try to lock on to a transport sight, a storm begins. storm? we've tried seven different sites and as soon as we lock on, an electrical storm forms right above the location. when we change sites, a new storm forms and the old one dissipates. might the transporter beam itself be causing an electrostatic charge in the atmosphere? that's as good a guess as any. i can't explain it. we just can't transport. fine, we'll take a shuttle. once again, the storm seems to have formed as a direct result of our interaction with the atmosphere. the meteorological conditions changed radically when we began our entry sequence. shields are holding. it takes more than a little thunderstorm to bother one of your mighty starfleet ships, huh? nothing we can't handle. relax, neelix. that's why they call it a rain forest. why do your sky spirits choose a place where it rains all the time? and it's hot... and there are so many bugs? it's said the sky spirits honored the land above all else. maybe it's because this land yields so many different kinds of life. maybe they wanted us to become friends with everything in nature. including the bugs. sorry, sky spirits. i will never make friends with bugs. maybe that's why they keep biting you. you're miserable. it was a mistake to bring you. i'm sorry. i'm sorry i can't be what you want me to be. from the day you came out of your mother... upside down... i knew the spirits had chosen you to be a contrary. no one chooses for me. i choose my own way. and if that makes me a contrary, i'll have to live with it. if you have no spirits to guide you, i fear you will lose your way. altitude: 5,000 meters. decreasing speed to 720 kph. entering terminal approach phase. visibility still zero. switching to enhanced terrain scanning. touchdown sight scanned. continuing descent. computer, activate the emergency medical holographic program. please state the nature of the medical emergency. i thought we changed your program so you wouldn't have to say that anymore. we did. but i became so uncomfortable trying to find new ways to ""break the ice,"" as it were, that i restored it. let's just say it works for me. doctor? ah, you noticed. are holograms supposed to... sneeze? generally, no. but i have accepted your challenge. i programmed myself with the symptoms of the 29-hour levodian flu. thus i will gain the experience that you suggest would be beneficial to the performance of my duties. holographic tissue paper for the holographic runny nose. don't offer them to patients. mmm, interesting sensation, blowing one's nose. it's my first time. i think this is very brave of you. nothing of the sort. i intend it to be an educational experience. i'm sure you'll learn a lot. i meant for the crew. i'm tired of the whiny, cranky attitudes we see around here. i intend to serve as an example of how one's life and duties do not have to be disrupted by simple illness. doc? i don't feel so good. neither do i, and you don't hear me complaining. we are not making any progress locating the source of that unusual power reading, commander. then i guess we'll have to search for these people the old-fashioned way... with our eyes and ears. is something bothering you, commander? no, it just reminds me of another jungle that i visited once. the central american rain forest on earth. it's the only other place in the universe that i've ever seen this flower. it appears to be a rare variety of cypriprdium of the asiatic genus paphiopedilum. i never knew you had such horticultural expertise, mr. vulcan. in fact, i am... or, more accurately, i was... a breeder of prize vulcan orchids. then we have something in common... i breed orchids, too! don't they make the most exquisite salad? a touch of baldoxic vinegar... pure heaven. i hereby designate the two of you the team's botanical surveyors. collect a sample of that flower. b'elanna? it's just what we've been looking for. almost pure polyferranide. but there's a problem with crust reactivity. if we can't solve it before excavation, we might contaminate the entire yield. have ensign kim run an analysis from the ship. we should be able to... i'll be damned. what? it almost looks like a hawk, doesn't it? listen to him, chakotay. what does he say to you? he says, ""you are home."" huh? i'm leaving the tribe, father. what? i got to know a lot of the starfleet officers patrolling the cardassian border. i asked captain sulu if he would sponsor me at starfleet academy. and he would do such a thing without even discussing it with me? i told him i had your approval. ah! i kept him as far away from you as i could. i take it you've been accepted by the academy. well, you've never fully embraced the traditions of our tribe, i know that. and you've always been curious about other societies. and that is why i allowed you to read about them. because i believe that ignorance is our greatest enemy. but to leave the tribe... our tribe lives in the past. a past of fantasy and myth. that past is a part of you, no matter how hard you try to reject it. other tribes have learned to accept the 24th century. why can't ours? it is not the place of a 15-year-old boy to question the choices of his tribe. i know. that's why i have to leave. you will never belong to that other life. and if you leave, you will never belong to this one. you'll be caught between worlds. i ask for your blessing, father. oon-day. oon-day, kolopak. botanical surveyor number one to commander chakotay. go ahead, neelix. you won't believe what i found. i think it's... neelix, what the...? the bird, the bird! my eye! away team to voyager. go ahead, commander. emergency beam-out. get neelix to sick bay. acknowledged. commander. you're very lucky this bird didn't snatch your eye right out of the socket. we have no spare talaxian eyeballs. is something the matter with him? the doctor gave himself the levodian flu to see what it's like. is he contagious? it's a holographic simulation, not an actual virus. there's no need for concern. you may sit up. touchy, isn't he? he isn't feeling well. i don't require any compassion, thank you very much. i have been experiencing these symptoms for nearly 20 hours, and i am in complete command of my faculties. you may both leave now. mr. kim believes if we bombard the crust with antithoron radiation, we can decontaminate it before excavation begins. then all we need to do is locate these people and get their permission. any progress? everything we've found here suggests the people who live in this village left recently and in a hurry. do you believe our arrival frightened them? we can't discount that. you'd think with warp technology, they would have encountered other alien life before now. you'd think with warp technology, they wouldn't be living like this. captain, have you had any unusual readings that might explain the images of a strange face i've been seeing? lmages? very odd. like the flash of a memory. but it's someone i've never met. nothing unusual has shown up on the ship's sensors. tuvok hasn't detected any telepathic activity, either. if you want to call it a day, commander... no. i think we'll press on for a while. if there are any other problems, i'll let you know. chakotay out. the dwellings are constructed with an alloy polymer matrix we've never encountered before, commander. they're out there. our tricorders may not tell us so, but they're out there. lay down your weapons. commander? disarm... i want them to see that we don't pose any threat to them. may i remind the commander that starfleet protocol demands that away teams remain armed and ready to defend themselves until contact is... i know all about starfleet protocol, lieutenant. as we have not yet established the inhabitants' intentions, it would not be a logical course of action. the logical course isn't always the right course. lay down your weapons in plain sight. those are my orders. would you at least permit me to advise the captain to move the ship into a stronger tactical position? negative. we'll show no force of any kind. for the record, i must take exception to these orders. noted. they have reason to be scared. who can blame them? their history, our history, is filled with conquerors who brought slavery and disease and death. maybe we should just leave them alone. oh-chip way-nob-ee teem-mock-uh an-tope-ah-nee. hi-yeta-koo-nay-pas. cha-kan-a hi-mee. cha-kan-a hi-mee. duh su kan-nuh-da. binda kana. binda kana. father. kah-yo-tay. hay-noh. chah-mooz-ee. teem-ma-ka-ha. i have no explanation, commander! there is no storm activity indicated. all right, let's get back to the shuttle. hey! wait! we will never make it! where's chakotay?! away team to voyager. emergency beam-out. he was right behind us. i don't understand what could have happened to him. was he wearing the combadge the last time you saw him? just before the storm, he was using it to speak with you, captain. mr. paris, what are the current surface conditions near the shuttle? surface conditions are back to normal, captain. winds two knots, but... i can't find any sign of their shuttle. it's not where they landed it. and it isn't airborne? no, ma'am. i'll lead the away team back. mr. tuvok, lieutenant, you're with me. mr. paris, you have... captain janeway, this is the doctor. please turn to your emergency medical holographic channel. what is it, doctor? something terrible has happened. my program... doctor, i think you're carrying this experiment of yours a little too far. one hour too far, to be precise. i very specifically programmed a 29-hour levodian flu. and it has now been 30 hours. doctor, i'm sorry, but we have more pressing matters... you can't leave me like this. i need help, now! get me somebody who can tweak the computer and make me feel better, immediately. very well. mr. kim is on his way. try to relax, doctor. i'll see to that, captain. i'm going to need you with me, kes. prepare a medkit and bring it with you to transporter room 3. commander chakotay is still on the surface and may be injured. janeway out. oh, i don't understand it. i... i ran a computer diagnostic and it said that my program was fine. just rest, doctor. here's a cool, holographic towel for your forehead. oh, thank you. thank you so much. please... don't go yet. i have to. the captain... i feel like i'm fading, just... fading away. you don't know what that means to a hologram. what seems to be the problem? my simulated virus is leading me to a simulated death. it's nothing to worry about. i just added a couple of hours to his computer program. he'll be fine in about 45 minutes. knowing when it would end didn't exactly make it a fair test, did it, doctor? oh, she is far more devious than i ever suspected. no shuttle. well, at least they got out okay. you have nothing to fear from me. talk to me. let me see you. is-to ko-hee-nis. no! thank you. you have nothing to fear from me. talk to me. let me see you. i don't understand it. it's the same thing that happened the first time we tried to go down. a storm develops wherever we try to lock on. why would we have the ability to beam people up, but not to beam them down? i believe we have seen enough to discern a pattern, captain. the logical conclusion is that someone is controlling the elements of nature to ward us off. the transporter anomaly is evidence of this conclusion. we are allowed to leave the planet, but not to approach. if that's true, i'd be happy to respect their wishes, but, unfortunately, i have a missing crewman to get back first. janeway to paris. yes, captain. mr. paris, we're going to land voyager on the surface. take us into the atmosphere. acknowledged. beginning entry sequence. i'm reading electrical storms forming all around us. adjusting flight path. the barometric pressure is continuing to fall. we're looking at monsoon conditions out there. mr. paris, the shuttle crew didn't report turbulence this severe during their landing. i'm doing the best i can, captain. i'm showing gale force winds out there. it is conceivable that the aliens have been able to intensify their response now that they are familiar with our capabilities. red alert! inertial dampers are off-line. we seem to be caught in some kind of vortex. i can't maintain altitude. captain, it's a cyclone. altitude 20,000 meters and falling. i can't get us out of this thing, captain. bridge to torres. we need more power from the engines. i've got them running 20 percent over rated maximum, captain. it's not enough. could we go to low warp under these conditions? the ship might make it without inertial dampers, but we'd all just be stains on the back wall. i can try to augment the engines with power from the auxiliary fusion reactors, but it's going to take at least 20 minutes. how much time do we have, mr. paris? altitude at 18,000 meters and falling. at this rate, we're looking at about ten minutes. if you can hear me, speak to me. dosh-du-pah kee-ne? swasge-muh kee-say-yo-pah? swas-ti-ma-hay. kee-say-yo-pah. pah-kee-ne?

yes. explain the face marking. i wear it to honor my father. he wore it to honor his ancestors. ancestors... you are human? yes. are there others on your world with this mark? yes. not many, but some. we were taught all of them had been annihilated. we were taught your world had been ravaged by those with no respect for life or land. there was a time when that was true. but no longer. he claims to be a descendent of the inheritors. inheritors? the ones... our ancestors chose to honor. i'm surprised you have no memory of the inheritors. one of our gifts was the memory. if you are a descendent, you should remember. i'm not sure i understand. perhaps it has been lost over time. 45,000 years ago, on our first visit to your world, we met a small group of nomadic hunters. they had no spoken language, no culture, except the use of fire and stone weapons, but they did have a respect for the land and for other living creatures that impressed us deeply. we decided to give them an inheritance... a genetic bonding... so they might thrive and protect your world. on subsequent visits, we found that our genetic gift brought about a spirit of curiosity and adventure. it impelled them to migrate away from the cold climate to a new, unpeopled land. it took them almost a thousand generations to cross your planet. hundreds of thousands of them flourished in their new land. their civilization had a profound influence on others of your species. but then new people came with weapons and disease. the inheritors who survived scattered. many sought refuge in other societies. 12 generations ago when we returned, we found no sign of their existence. my people called you the sky spirits. why have you been hiding from us since we landed here? when we heard your message, who you were, observed you probing our land, we believed you were a threat. we thought you would annihilate us as you had the inheritors. our message was supposed to communicate peaceful intentions. we were taught that is the way human conquerors often introduce themselves. as i said... we've tried to change our ways since the last time you stopped by. altitude: 2,000 meters. stand by, bridge. we're initiating the transfer now. i'm showing an eight percent boost in the engines. that's all? the fusion reactors are nearly drained. fighting the storm is taking every reserve we have. altitude: 1,000 meters. impact in 20 seconds. b'elanna. impact in 15 seconds. i'm sorry, captain, that's all we've got. impact in ten seconds. report. we're free. gaining altitude. 2,000 meters. 2,500. dampers back on line. the storms have completely dissipated. there's not a cloud in the sky. stand down red alert. anybody have an explanation? it appears the inhabitants of this planet have decided to make contact, captain. the cloaking device has been turned off, and we are showing an alien population. i have located the shuttle. it may be possible to locate commander chakotay without landing. establish a search pattern, mr. paris. yes, captain. begin scanning for human life signs. as soon as you find chakotay, we'll send down an away team. my ship will be coming for me soon. i'm sorry we cannot permit you to extract all the materials you need. you were generous to offer as much as you did. you have a long journey ahead. it took us more than two generations to reach your world. i wish i could see my father's face right now. does he still live? no. he died fighting enemies who would have taken our home colony. our tribe moved there a few hundred years ago. so he honored the land just as... his ancestors did. yes. yes, he did. we weren't on very good terms when he died. once he was gone, i didn't know how to reconcile our differences, how to heal our old wounds. i returned to my colony, and continued the fight in his name. i took the mark that he wore to honor his ancestors. i spoke to him in my vision quests, but he never answered. until now. chah-mooz-ee. commander. put those away. listen to him, chakotay. do you hear what he says to you? yes, father. i hear him. i finally hear him. four to beam up, voyager."

(thunderous crash) that's it, ""look out, a meteor is about to hit the ship, "" - i knew it would come back to me, - thanks! - sorry, - what's wrong with you, holly? - he's computer-senile. - is there any damage? i don't know, the damage report machine's damaged, - where did it hit? - all my monitors are out, round about floor 591, i think, you're as much use as a condom machine in the vatican. nothing here. let's try 592. er... has anybody seen my legs? they're not below my waist where i normally keep them. - holly, where are rimmer's legs? - here they are right here! - stop them! - c'mon, leggies. over here. of course, 592, that's where the hologram simulation suite is, - what does this mean? - it's probably not serious, if it's not serious when your genitals wander off on their own, what is? wait for me-me-me-me-me-me! here it is, 592, rimmer, are you all right? (odd high-pitched voice) well, you see, the shuttle was late. and they're usually so good. they're so good. they're brilliant. what's happened to him? - he's brannigan, ship's psychiatrist. - we'd better get him fixed, (alarm beeps) i've got it in hand, no panic, (as holly) no panic everyone. i've got it in hand. (holl y) just override the charred relays, - just override the charred relays. - how do you do that? - (as lister) how do you do that? - bypass the main circuit, (as holly) bypass the main circuit. - this one? - (as lister) this one? - yeah, that one, - yeah, that one. - now press the bypass, - now press the bypass. (yelps) that was horrible. i never want to go through that again! aow! aow! hey! now he's me! stick the red plug in the blue socket, (rimmer yelps) - am i ok now? - (holl y) yeah, shouldn't this plug into something? oh, yeah, that joins up with the white cable, (crackling, lister yells) ,,or is it the yellow cable? yes, it should have been yellow, you are a total, total... a word has yet to be invented to describe you, but you are one, and a total one at that. keep your hair on, - i'm lucky to keep my legs on. - he's out to lunch. he's out to lunch, breakfast, dinner, the lot! he's not in for a single meal. - hey, who's that? - aliens! - queeg! - who's queeg? i'm queeg 500, the back-up computer, all vessels of the jupiter mining corporation fleet carry a back-up computer to replace the primary computer if the primary computer contravenes article 5, i am therefore assuming control, this is mutiny, mr queeg, you'll swing from the highest yardarm in titan docking port for this, what's article 5? gross negligence, leading to the endangerment of personnel, - but holly has an iq of 6,000! - (holl y) right on, - is that what he told you? - well, what is it? it has a six in it, but it's not 6,000, - what is it? - six, six? do me a lemon! that's a poor iq for a glass of water! how come he knows all about science and space when we ask him? - he consults a book, - what a slimeball! he gets all his information on science from a single book, - what book? - junior encyclopaedia of space, it's the only one he could find with pictures, that's slander, that is, you'd better find a good lawyer, guy, - that's why he's never on the case! - i am on the case, i'm sharp, i'm kicking bottom, how come he can navigate us back to earth? he can 't, you've been going around in circles for 14 months, - you what? - a load of tottenham, that is, a steaming pile of hotspur, i'm on to his game, he's turning you against me, so he can take over, no discussions, the decision has been made, you've been bypassed, you've been retired, - i'm in my prime! - you'll be nightwatchman, from now on, red dwarf is run by queeg 500, queeg to all personnel, course redirection implemented, new bearing 057-776, message ends, ah, lister, this is a bit different, isn't it? see those skutters, charging up and down the corridor, repairing, sweeping? the lifts are fixed. the fire extinguishers work. and i mean they work when you turn them on, as opposed to when you happen to pass them and cough. yeah, i suppose. there's no point feeling sorry about holly. it's a kindness. he's like an old incontinent sheepdog who's had his day. take him out to the barn with a shotgun and blow the mother away. i'm only saying that because i'm fond of him. - how do you think holly feels? - he doesn't feel anything. he's a computer. he still feels. sometimes i think it's cruel giving machines a personality. my mate bought a pair of shoes with artificial intelligence. smart shoes, they were called. no matter how blind drunk you were, they could always get you home. he got ratted one night in oslo, and woke up the next morning in burma. see, the shoes got bored. they wanted to see the world. he couldn't get rid of them. whenever he sold them, they'd show up again the next day and kick the door down. - is this true? - yeah. last thing he heard, they'd robbed a car and driven into a canal. - they couldn't steer. - really? yeah. petersen was blown away about by it. he went to see a priest. he said that the shoes had gone to heaven. it turns out shoes have ""souls"". well, what a sad, sad story. wait a minute... how did they open the car door? (alarm) off! uh, queeg? why has my alarm clock gone off at six o'clock? that's the time you asked for, holly and i had this little understanding. i'd say, ""wake me up at six without fail,"" then holly would pretend to forget, and wake me around ten with breakfast. ok? (alarm sounds) off! queeg, i can see we've already cultivated a special understanding - i scratch your back and you stick a knife in mine. - give me a uniform. - exercises first, ah, yes. now once again, holly and i had this understanding... (queeg) move it, boy! what are you doing?! i'm putting you through the regulation 500 jerks, - stop it. - then it's a three-mile run, you just can't take control of my body! the company pays for your hologramatic survival, in space, i am the company, - lister, wake up! help! - what's going on? queeg! he's making me fit! what are you doing?! my stomach won't take it! it's too flabby! - one! - mummy! - two! three! - mercy! help me! - four! - holly and i had an understanding! yes! fight that flab! i want my body back! three more hours will kill me! i'm going to faint! i said food! is anybody home? what's the matter with him? he fainted after the first 500 yards, - you made him jog unconscious? - it's regulations, yes! nice one, queeg! right, 0700, time for astronavigation revision, i'd better wake him, (slapping sound) revise and learn pages 25 to 59, you will then be tested, if you fail, tomorrow you do five miles, i am now returning control of your body, (mutters) hey, i can't get any food! - try a different machine. - i did. ""you have run out of credits."" - they've all gone crazy! - queeg, what's happened? article 497, when a crewmember runs out of credit, food may not be supplied until the balance is restored, nah. listen, me and holly, we had this little understanding... - if you want food, you have to work, - work?! you'd better start. i'm one hungry pussycat. - both ofyou, - whoa! i don't do the ""w"" word. cats do not work! i've got a note from my mommy. - from now on, everybody works! - not this pussy! i can't believe i'm doing this! look at me! i'm disgusting! i'm like you in your best clothes! look, it's easy. just imagine the floor is queeg's face. (both spit) aw, look at my hands! i had lovely hands! - well, wear the smegging gloves! - marigolds with blue? are you crazy? - how long do we have to do this? - it's only been ten minutes. - we've got to do it all day. - what?! all day? the whole day? i'm a cat. if i don't nap, i don't have enough energy for my main snooze. halt! who goes there? friend or foe? - holly! - how you doin'? let me wipe your screen. - so, how's it going? - what you been up to, man? oh, this nightwatchman lark keeps me busy, shining me torch down corridors, turning it off, shining it again, life's pretty full, - help us, hol. - queeg has got to go! look at my cuticles. he's a maniac. (breathless) i agree! he's got us working for food. well, no doubt he knows what he's doing, unlike certain senile wrecks of computers we could mention, still, it was nice how everyone defended me, - different story now, - i defended you. i remember, queeg says i've got an iq of six, and you leap to my defence, saying, ""really? that explains everything!"" - no. that was ri mmer! - nevertheless, certain characters don 't believe my iq is 6,000, - i believe you. - i could prove it, - there's no need. - i want to, ok, what's the square root of 2,049? - oh, you want me to prove it? - no, no. clearly doing the square root of 2,049 will prove i have an iq of 6,000, - what is it? - you wouldn 't prefer a sports question? - forget it. it's not important. - it is to me, i want to clear my name, well, what is the square root of 2,049? - how about a space question? - like what? like, ""what's the nearest planet to the sun?"" - what's the nearest planet to the sun? - easy-peasy, that's right down my particular field of expertise, your nearest basic planet to your actual sun is,,, mercury, - that's right. - ye of little faith, - well, i 'm convi nced. - me, too. can we get rid of queeg? do you believe i'm the right dude for the gig? - yeah. - i'll be in touch, (whistles great escape theme) he's taking the smeg! - who is? - queeg. look at what he's given me. a pea on toast. one pea. i tell you, i'm that far from cracking. i've lost me pea! oh, that's it! i've cracked. he's just doing this to destroy your morale. is he? well, i want me pea back. i earned that pea! where is it? i don't care if it's under the bed with me toenail clippings, i earned it. i'm going to eat it, no matter what. it flew into your dirty sock basket. i'll just have the toast. - why didn't we stick up for holly? - i did. you did?! when? - all right, i didn't. - nobody did. it's terrible. we thought we'd get something better. what about trust? what about fidelity? what about simple, basic, honest friendship? friendship? do you know how many people i can count as true friends? well, if you count inflatable ingrid, your polythene pal, one. i'll tell you. none. i got burned once and i learned my lesson. don't trust anybody. there was this one lad, porky roebuck. i'd known him ten years. we were almost family. his dad was knocking off my mum, that's how close we were. - we were in the space scouts together. - space scouts? oh, yes... pinkle! squirmy! blip-blap-blap! we were 15 years old. we went on this survival course, sleeping rough, surviving on wild berries and rainwater. - where did you go? butlins? - we each got a swiss army knife. you only ate what you killed yourself. ten boys got together and decided to eat me. they tied me to a stake, lit a fire and poured barbecue sauce all over me. i remember thinking as i went round and round, ""porky will save me. he's my best friend."" it turned out porky was the ringleader and had bagsied my right buttock. if it wasn't for the space mistress, they really would have eaten me. oh, come on. they were only bullying you. you know what kids are like. the point is, friends are only friends when it suits them. oh... lights. - lister? - yeah? how did you know about inflatable ingrid? i've been seeing her behind your back. - compute, - compute. the product of the correlation of vx/dy minus the sum of the set v1 over the sum of r, given that r is a ratio of p over s and s is an integer variable, - just one small question... - yes? what does ""compute"" mean? just do it! and you two, stop shirking and get working! # do not forsake me, oh, my love # i only know i must be brave # for i must face the man who hates me # or i will cower in my grave... # queeg, i want my ship back, - too bad, - you'll have to fight for her, hol, this man's a nutter. - i challenge you to the game ofyour choice, - oh, my god. - the winner gets command of red dwarf, - and the loser? the loser will be erased, terminated, oblivionised, - bye- bye, baldy. - name your game, - chess, - any game, - chess, - draughts, poker,,,anything, - chess, - subbuteo, snakes and ladders,,, - chess, - monopoly, maybe?

- he's lost. - and the loser gets erased, noughts and crosses? what kind of plan was that? a stupid plan, that's what it was. - why didn't we stop him? - we thought he had something up his sleeve. now we've got queeg forever, and that's a long time. - well, dudes, i've come to say goodbye, - you're definitely getting rubbed? - 'fraid so, - life'll be hell! well, see you, dave, - hope it works out with kochanski, - cheers, hol. see you, cat, i hope you fulfil your heart's desire and get your end away, thanks, man. and arnold,,, i hope you meet those aliens and get a body, get a sex life and all the rest you feel you need, thanks, hol. well, i hate long goodbyes, perhaps next time you're down the disco, you'll raise a glass to old holly and think, ""things weren 't too bad with him, ""perhaps not the most efficient computer, but we had a giggle, "" - oh, one last thing,,, 45,265**1, - what?

1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"(""alfred hitchcock"" theme music) - good evening. welcome to the hitchcock pavilion of the world's fair. the lack of activity at this stand is rather embarrassing, especially when i tell you that i'm buying kisses not selling them. it all seemed like such a good idea, buying some kisses for a dollar and then turning around and selling them for two. unfortunately, just after going into business, i discovered that several unscrupulous persons were giving them away. i shall probably lose my entire investment, this stand, a crate of lemons and a pound of alum. after all, with lips like mine, puckering could be a problem. this evening's story concerns some rather bizarre events, which take place in a very ordinary home in very ordinary surroundings, the suburbs of a large city. it is called ""misadventure"", and begins just as quickly as we can run through this next commercial. (telephone ringing) - [george] if that's for me, i'll be right there, darling. - hello. - hello. is that 555-6709? - no, this is 555-6790. - [bruce] oh, i must have a wrong number, sorry. - well, that's perfectly all right. no trouble at all. - really? - really. - are you sure? - i'm sure. - [bruce] tell you what i'll be over in about half an hour. - yes, yes, you do that. goodbye. - goodbye. - wrong number. (chuckles softly) do you have to do that every time? - what's that, darling? - nothing, dear, it's just that when i see you polishing the silverware i just washed, i get the feeling i'm in a restaurant or something. - do you know my father used these tools all of his life, these same little gravediggers. - yes, dear, i know. - just think of the thousands of times that that fork went in and out of the old man's mouth. all those meals, breakfast, lunches, dinners, snacks. - yes, dear. - gives me great satisfaction to have his silver. it's not like being in a restaurant at all. i mean, i know where these have been. - yes, dear. - by the way i'll be home for lunch today. - oh. - you weren't going out, were you? - no. yes, as a matter of fact, i was going to town. - oh. well, i'll have to have lunch at the coffee shop then. - i'm sorry, darling. but i really do have a lot of shopping to do. - it's all right. hey, we have any of that lobster left? - well, yes, we have some in the refrigerator. did you want some? - no, no, no, no, not now. i was just thinking. why should i pay out all that money to a restaurant? i'll just come home and have the lobster, a little salad and a great big gob of mayonnaise. you get some mayonnaise? - i'll get some, dear. it's awfully late, darling. you'd better hurry. - goodbye, dear. have a nice day in town. (dramatic music) - goodbye, dear. - bye. oh, dear. here's $3. have a good lunch. - thank you, darling. - bye, bye. - thank you very much. (soft knocking on door) - the gas man. - beg your pardon? - may i read the meter? - oh, yes, come in. - well? - [eva] what'd you say? - well, where is it? - it's right through there. the light switch is on the wall. - i can't remember every house, you know. no matter how many times you been there they just don't pay us to be that smart. - well, sorry. (gas blowing) - i'd like to know who's been playing with that meter. - nobody been playing with meter that i know of. is anything wrong? - anything wrong? we're not fooled by a sudden low reading on the meter. - now look here just what are you suggesting? - i'm not suggesting anything. - well, really i assure you that if the... if there's a low reading on the meter, it isn't because somebody's been tampering with the silly thing. (gas blowing) oh, ooh, there's a terrible smell of gas in there. - i don't smell anything. - oh, you can even hear it. - no, there's nothing down there. - you left something open. - i don't smell anything. you left one of the burners on. yeah, we're always being called in. - they were off i just checked them. it's coming from in there, i tell you. - from in where? - from in the basement. you can even hear it. it's awful. - lady, look i can't spend the whole morning holding your hand. - please, please don't go now. you can't just walk out and leave me with this. - listen if anything was wrong, i'd know, wouldn't i? - look will you just listen? if you can't smell it, just listen. (gas blowing) don't light a match, you fool! you wanna blow up the house. - you watch out who you're hitting, lady. i'll report you to the gas company. (gas blowing) (coughing softly) (dramatic music) - i turned the valve off. the pipe is broken. would you please fix it right away? (dramatic music) what's the matter with you? what's the telephone number of the gas company? i asked you a question. what's your number? - but if i tell you, you'll call them and report me. - certainly, i'll call and report you. you're incompetent, also irresponsible. - don't tell them, lady. i'll lose my job. - it's about time, i'd say. - no, no, no, look i'll fix the leak. i promise just as soon as i'm over this attack of fever. - fever? - it's only malaria. it isn't contagious. now please they'll fire me if they find out i've been sick again. - [operator] national gas company can i help you? - for their sake. - hello. can i help you? hello. - please. - [operator] hello? - i'm sorry, i have the wrong number. - (gasping) thank you, lady. thank you. - get up off the floor and fix the thing, will you? this is ridiculous, i have a busy morning ahead of me. - you're being very civilized, and i won't forget it. i'll be alright in a minute if you could just, just spare a minute. - look i'd better call a doctor. you can't stay here if you're sick. - oh, no. no, don't call the doctor. they'll find out. you see, a doctor would have to report me. - well, you can't work this way. - no, i'll be alright in a minute. - you want some coffee? - oh, yes, yes. (man shivering) if you've a blanket, i'm so cold. - there, is that alright? - no, that's marvelous. you're very kind. i've always considered you a very kind and sensitive person. - oh, really, and how would you know that? - well, i seen you before when i come to read the meter. - oh. well, i try to do my best for people. - i'm sorry if i seemed rude when i come in, but i was half out of my mind. these old wounds they kick up when these attacks come. - you have old wounds? - yeah, i was fighting in the south pacific, captured, tortured, put in a pw camp for three years. lucky, i guess. - that's luck. - yes. i was a colonel. - a colonel, very impressive. - i guess, i'd better get at that pipe. - i must say you don't sound like a gas man. (dramatic music) are you alright? - it's no good, is it? no, it never really goes away till i get warmed up. i'd better go and come back later. - yes, that's a good idea. you'll feel better when you get home. - no, oh, no, i can't go home like this. well, it's scares my wife, and she's always looking for a chance to leave me anyway. no, i'll go find a park bench someplace, and i'll wait there. - it's cold out you can't just. this is ridiculous. i've got things to do. - don't you worry about me. - we've got to get a doctor and an ambulance. - you really wanna help me? - yes, but as you can see i'm very busy. - there's something you can do to help me. it won't take any time, just a few minutes, and i'll be all right. - well, what? - a hot bath or shower it always works. - now really come off it i can't-- - i promise just 10 minutes and i'll be okay. - all right, all right. but you've got to hurry. i've got some friends coming. - i'll never forget your kindness. - nevermind that just hurry because i've got some friends coming to play bridge. - i understand. it wouldn't look right for a mere gas man to be found taking a shower. - it isn't that. it doesn't matter who. (telephone ringing) look can you manage? - yes, i'll manage. - hello. - hello, eva? - yes, marge. (gentle dramatic music) marge, dear, i can't talk right now. can i call you back? - alright, dear. - i've got a cake in the oven. - [marge] that's as good an excuse as any. - yes, dear, goodbye. uh, mister. are you alright? mister? are you alright? well, how'd i get into this? mister, i'm coming in. i'm coming in. where are you? (gentle music) (gentle music) oh, no. - i think, i'm going to be all right. - i thought you were dead. that would've been the end. hey, you get out of there! - i think it's gone. - you get out of that bed this instant. - lying down takes the strain off my wounds. - you can't stay in there. (doorbell ringing) - you're perfectly right. anybody finding me here would certainly get the wrong impression. - you stay there. - no, i couldn't possibly stay in your bed. somebody at the front. - you stay there! - oh, no. - if you make one sound, and i'll kill you. (doorbell ringing) - hi. - hi, darling. bruce, listen to me. will you just listen to me? - [bruce] it's been four days since i've seen you. - bruce, don't. now stop it. - why, give me a reason? - because i made a mistake. - what kind of a mistake? - my husband's on his way home. - what? - he called and said he was sick, and he's coming home. wait you will call tomorrow? - sure, sure if i got the time, i'll call tomorrow. - you take that robe off and get out of this house. my husband will kill you if he saw you in that. (eva gasping) (man giggling) stop that! get out of there, or i will call the police. - oh, darling, it's been four days. - you're a fake. there's nothing wrong with you at all. - my ears are fine. - [eva] this is impossible! - oh, how he ran when he heard your husband was coming home. courage of a rabbit that the best you could do. - that is none of your business now get out. - admit he's your boyfriend. - i don't have to admit anything to you. - where are you going? - i am going to call the gas company, and then i'm going to call the police. - oh, good, call your husband at the same time. i'd like to tell him all about this business. - he won't believe you. i'll tell him you attacked me. - and, just suppose i do? - if i say you attacked me, he'll believe me. - all right. you call your husband. you tell him a strange man is in your bed, and he won't get out. - you think i won't? - mm-hmm, you tell him that you gave the strange man permission to take a shower, and now he's in your bed. ooh, that should make very good explanation. - get out of here right now. if you think i'm not going to do anything because i'm afraid of my husband, you'd he's not gonna take some fool gas man's word against mine. now you get out or i will scream this house down. - you think my being here is some kind of an accident. i've been watching you for weeks. - what do you mean? - i saw your boyfriend coming in one day when i was making my rounds. - he's a landscape artist. - oh, is that what they call them nowadays. - he came here two months ago to install a fishpond. now will you take your hands off me. - he was here three times last week. aren't the fish well? - that's a lie. - i have three pictures of him, on monday, wednesday, and thursday. see i've been sitting in my car across the street most of last week watching you. - i don't believe you. - here, not bad for a telephoto lens. i overexpose them on soft paper and then under develop them. it makes for a less contrasting print that way. - you're a blackmailer. - no, i've never given it much thought. - well, this time you picked the wrong person because i haven't got any money. so the joke's on you. (chuckles softly) - come on now, huh? nice house like this must be worth quite a bit. - he doesn't give me one cent more than it takes to run it. - yeah, well, i've only seen him once in my life, but he did strike me as being a bit prudent. - prudent? he is a tight-fisted miser. - [henry] filthy rich? - loaded. but not with cash. it's mostly in trust funds, stocks, and bonds. you know, that sort of thing. - relax i'm not a professional blackmailer. - oh, come off it. those pictures you went to a lot of trouble. - no, no, no it was fun. - well, i must say you certainly set this up like a pro. - no, no just an amateur. - you're very beautiful. i suppose you're tired of hearing men tell you that. - what do you mean, ""just an amateur?"" - well, blackmailers do it for money, don't they? i'm not after your money, dear. (dramatic music) (man sobbing gently) - what's the matter? you crying? you are crying? ha, what have you got to cry about? if anybody's gonna cry, it should be me. although, i must say, you are a most unusual gas man. - i'm not a gas man. - well, then what are you? i don't even know your name. - if you think that a gas man can take all this time off without getting fired, you're very naive. - well, would you kindly explain it? - i've been watching you every day, all day, even into the night hoping to catch a glimpse of you. - what are you talking about? - the thoughts that go through my mind. i bought a gun last week. - oh, now look here-- - don't worry. if i use it, it'll be on myself. - you alright? - when i was watching that boyfriend of yours, i was overcome by an emotion i never felt before in my life. - and what was that? - jealousy, raging jealousy! i wanted to kill that rat with my bare hands. - now listen this is a respectable neighborhood. - and your husband, the number of times i've plotted his murder in the last week or two. - now wait just a minute. - that's why i bought this gas man's uniform. it was all part of the plan. know how it was going to work? - well, hardly. - i was coming by like i did this morning, but i'd come by when you were out shopping and he was alone. - mm-hmm. - then i was gonna go down to the basement. it was the basement that gave me the idea. it has only one vent, and you can stuff it with a newspaper. and then i was going to disconnect the gas pipe. well, you have a large oven in effect. - like you did a while ago, you mean? - no, no, no that was just to annoy you. then i was going to disconnect the pipe below the valve and take out the screw inside the basement door and leave. - mm-hmm. - place would fill up with gas. george would smell it. he'd go down to investigate, and when he found he couldn't fix it by turning the valve, he'd rush back up to the basement door. turn the knob, give it a pull, it'll come off in his hand. - on the inside. - clever? - oh, crazy. - it would work. - oh, yes, it would work. but why couldn't he just fit the knob back on and left himself out. - well, he probably could if he wasn't in a hurry and breathing in gas all the time. there's very little margin for error. the bar is very lose. miss that bar by 1/64 of an inch, and it falls out on the other side. that's it. verdict: accidental death by misadventure. - (chuckling) it's very ingenious. i locked myself in a friend's bathroom once the same way. you know, you have to be a little way out to figure this. - i'm madly in love with you. - well, come on you better get dressed. my husband will be home pretty soon for lunch. - you don't understand. i'm serious. - or would you rather fix it for him? now come on. - maybe you'll be more impressed when i tell you that i'm a private detective, and that i'm here to get evidence for the divorce your husband is planning. - what? - i thought that might impress you, and it looks like i've got the evidence, doesn't it? mm-hmm, you're like all wives with fat husbands. you underestimate their brains. he's been on to you for some months. - you dirty, sneaking. - so, you just investigated a year of your life for nothing. with the evidence i've got, your husband is gonna sue that fishpond artist for alienation of affection. you're not only broke but out in the cold. - i knew you were a phony all along. i just knew it. - too late now though, isn't it? - you don't have to tell him. - oh, yeah. yeah, you love me now. now that you think i got something on you. that's what i was afraid of. - you report to him, and you will never see me again, i promise you. - but, dear, it doesn't matter whether i report it or not. he already suspected what was going on before he called me in. my reports only confirmed that a man was coming around to see you. - you mean you already told him! - how was i to know that i was going to fall in love with you. i haven't shown him the pictures yet. but he's already got enough evidence to start divorce proceedings. - how dare he suspect me of being unfaithful! - he's got a mean and suspicious nature, my dear. - what i've been through with him. eating. (dishes clanking) eating, eating, and his endless boring talk about his endless boring family, and how many times that fork went into his precious father's mouth. - dear, dear, dear, dear. it's alright don't worry. he's not gonna bother you anymore, my dear. now it's true i'm not rich. well, i'm in debt up to my ears. but look i got a little apartment, just a couple of rooms over a butcher's shop, but we can fix it up and it'll be real nice. don't you worry we're gonna manage. i got a lot of credit cards, and i'm very handy with a hammer and saw. - all the time he's been sitting there stuffing himself and smiling at me and he knew all along. - deceitful man. - get your car. i'm going to fill it with everything in this house worth taking starting with his precious family silver. - [henry] it wouldn't work. he'd have your arrested in hours. - he's not gonna get away with this. - there's nothing you can do now, dear. except pray that he gets run over on a bus own his way home, or that his asthma chokes him. no, being a widow is the only way to get anything out of him now. what are you doing? - it was your idea. - oh, no. not murder. - but you said it was a simple case of misadventure. - oh, no. i can't. - i thought you'd do anything for me. (man stammering) - but i'm not stupid enough to murder. murder is no basis for a lasting marriage. - what marriage? - ours. i know i'm rushing things a bit. - look, darling. - henry. - henry. - henry. - henry, i can't live over a butcher shop. - i can fix it up. i'm very handy. - i don't care how handy you are. i like nice things, space, and a new car, and a good vacation every year. i want those things for you, for us together, i don't want you to have to work all your life. you work too hard. - yes. i just knew you felt something for me. - well, a girl can't show everything she feels for a man, or he might think she's cheap. (gentle music) - i suppose if two people love each other enough. - now why don't you just fix that door, darling, and i'll go and change my clothes. and i'll hide in the garden shed. you said you didn't want me here anyway when you did it. he's gonna home pretty soon. - look. - what's the matter? (stammers softly) - i don't know if i got the nerve actually. - i'll turn on the gas if that's what's bothering you. as you said, ""it's just a case of misadventure."" - i hope we're doing the right thing, dear. - of course, we are. - we have reached the halfway point in our story. while you visit your local station for a moment, i shall act as an electronic bookmark, so that you will know where you left off. (george whistling) - darling, hello! oh, no. oh, it's father's best bone china. darling! darling, what's happened? oh, not all the good cups. she must be out of her mind. - [colin] look on the bright side, george. think of all the spare saucers you've got. - [george] colin. - aren't you glad to see me, george? - of course. of course, i'm glad to see you. you look so much older, colin. - well, things haven't been very easy for me these last five years. perhaps it shows. - my, my has it really been five years since you've been in this house? - yeah, perhaps just as well considering how things were the last time we met. - well, surely, two brothers can have a little quarrel now and again without becoming bad friends. ""blood is thicker than water after all."" - as your mother used to say. - yes, i was sorry you couldn't make it to mother's funeral. - i never liked funerals, george. - (stammers) well? - how long am i gonna stay? don't worry, george. i have a reservation on this evening's plane. - oh, so soon. what a shame. - just a quick business trip. - you must have met my wife. or did you let yourself in? we seem to be in a terrible mess. eva! - she's not here, george. - oh, that's right she was going shopping. (george coughing) she seems to have had some kind of an accident. dear me, she's a charming girl. you did meet though, huh? - yes. we met. (george chuckles) - not a bad catch for a fellow like me, eh? did you have time to talk to her? - yes, we got on quite intimate terms as a matter of fact considering the short time we spent together. - well, i'm glad. she has a charming way even with strangers. - by the way, here's a picture that might interest you. - oh. is this? - yes. that's my wife margaret, the two boys, and little sandra. - she looks. - yes. she looks terrible, doesn't she? - i must confess i wouldn't have recognized her. - well, as i said, things have been rather difficult for us lately. - well, my nephew michael seems to have grown. curious, colin, but i thought you had four children. - that isn't michael. it's david. - oh. - michael died last week. it was appendicitis. the old car broke down and didn't make it in time. - i am sorry. - are you? remember i wrote you two years ago asking for some money to replace that car, but you said you needed a new car for yourself? - colin, i hope you're not suggesting that it was my fault that your boy died? - no, no. nothing's anybody's fault, george, not in this world. no. (chuckles) it was just a case of death by misadventure. - mm. i am sorry, colin. - a combination of unfortunate circumstances. - hey, do you smell gas? - oh, that's my fault. i was trying to fix some coffee, and i couldn't get it lighted. - oh, what a terrible thing. i told her never to touch the good china. i use it myself, of course. it was father's you remember? - oh, yes, i remember it very well. that's why i broke it. - you, why? why would you break father's china? - they are half mine. - that's no reason to break it! - well, actually i thought it might please the old man's ghost. i'm sure he's tired watching you swill your coffee out of them. - that's utter nonsense! you just did it to keep me from enjoying them that's all! - why would i wanna do that? - because you never got over your jealousy of my mother. that's why. - your mother was a pleasant hobby my father took up in middle age to occupy and amuse himself with after my mother died. (chuckles sarcastically) i certainly was never jealous. - don't you dare talk about my mother like that. you'd better go i can see nothing has changed between us. - yeah. alright, i'll go. first i'd like to ask you a question. after all, i did come all this way to kill you. (glasses clanking) - you're out of your mind. - yes, you see i'm quite serious. don't panic, george. i've had a change of mind. this was just in case. (dry coughing) - what do you want? - my share what else would i want from you. - well, you have no rights. - no, i got no legal rights. your lawyers have made that very clear. the old man's money went to your mother, then to you, and all is legal. but it's really half mine, isn't it? i mean, if you really wanna be fair. - colin, the old man didn't have as much money as you think. i've had high expenses. - keeping it away from me, you mean. look, george, i mean i only want a few thousands. big things are happening in africa. an investment in one of the big african concerns, and life would be a lot easier for all of us. for the last time, george. can i have my share or not? - colin, you don't seem to understand. - yes or no, george? - no. - yes. well, i didn't think it'd been yes. well, there was never any love between us. why should you share with me? - exactly why should i? would you do the same for me? - yes. i think i would. but then, my mother was soft hearted. it was her money originally, you know. did you know that? yeah. oh, well, doesn't matter now. i'll be off. - goodbye, colin. - no. i don't wanna shake that wet fish hand of yours. it makes my soul shiver. - well, whatever you like. it doesn't make a bit of difference just so long as you don't ever come in this house again. - oh, by the way your wife's in the basement. - what, what did you say? - well, like i told you when i came here, i had the bright idea of killing you. well, i knew you'd turn me down. i figured the only way i could get my share would be to inherit it being your only relative. but as long as you had a wife, well, i couldn't inherit it, could i? so i got rid of her first. i am sorry, george. - you. eva! - in the basement, george. (dramatic music) (coughing deeply) (gas blowing) - eva! eva! (dramatic music) there's no one here! (george coughing) (gas blowing) (george banging) colin! (george banging on door) (gentle music) - well? - it's done. - nothing went wrong? - well? - what happened? - well, it's alright now. - will you tell me what happened? - well, he wouldn't go down to shut off the gas, so i had to put him down. - you didn't hit him or anything? - well, how else could i get him down there? - oh, you fool. - he wasn't about to go down there with all that gas. there was nothing else i could do. - it isn't going to look very accidental, is it? - yeah, well, i mean they'll think he fell down the stairs and banged his head or something. look don't worry. - don't worry! you practically put us in the gas chamber with your stupidity, and you say don't worry! - look, all right, now you're hysterical. now they'll never be able to figure it out. - the police have all these scientific things. - i'm a detective. i know what they've got. - you shouldn't have hit him. - dear, everything is going to be all right. try to forget about it. everything is fine. i wiped up the blood. - blood! where was it? - in the kitchen here and there. you won't find a trace of it. - but they will. they can trace anything. - that's only on television. real policemen aren't that lucky. - why did i ever trust you? you're such a fool. you're as big a fool as george! - there, there, there, dear. - don't touch me, and don't call me dear! i'm not your dear, and i wouldn't be your dear if you were the last man in the world! and as for marrying you and living over some fish shop, i wouldn't be! - butcher shop. there now pull yourself together. just a bit more, and we'll be finished. - get me a drink, will you, in the den over there? (dramatic music) - sure. - operator. - operator. get me the police. - [officer] police department, officer smith. - hello, listen. - darling, don't call the police yet. we're not ready yet take it easy. well you, you weren't going to-- - you murdered him. it was even your idea. i'm not going to take the blame. - you were going to tell the police that. - you came here and forced me into it. - now, darling, think it over. it was you that took the screw out of the knob. it was you that broke the gas pipe. they won't find my fingerprints on anything. they'll know you were lying. - fingerprints? - you fingerprints don't matter. you live here. oh, trust me, darling. can't you trust me? - how could i trust you? you're such a fool. - oh, you're upset. now look i'll tidy up around here, and you make your calls according to plan. - i don't think we should. - we have got to establish an alibi for you. you better hurry. - [receptionist] martin and cranbourne may i help you? - hello, this is mrs. martin. may i speak to my husband please? - [receptionist] i'm sorry, mrs. martin, he's gone to lunch. - i see, well, i'm in town shopping. i'll try the house thank you very much. - [receptionist] you're welcome, mrs. martin. - what if they trace the call? - they can't. - operator. - operator. give me the police please. - [officer] police department, officer smith. - hello, i'm worried about my husband, and i wondered if you could help. you see he said he was going home for lunch, and he doesn't answer the phone. he has very bad asthma and i wondered-- - [officer] can i have your name and address please? - mrs. eva martin, 27 crescent drive. i'm in town shopping, and i suppose it's silly to worry. but i called his office, and they said he definitely went home for lunch. - [officer] i see, mrs. martin, and what is the number you're calling from? - i'm in a booth. i'll only be here for a little while. i'll call you back in 20 minutes. - [officer] very well, ma'am i'll send a man over to check it out. - oh, yes, that would relieve my mind. thank you very much, goodbye. now come on let's get out of here. (telephone ringing) - that'll be the police checking to see that you've dialed your husband at the right number. - oh, hurry please. do come on. what's the matter? what is the matter? - i can't find those pictures. - what pictures? - the ones i took of you and your boyfriend. - in the bedroom. - no, no, i had them since i was in the kitchen. i had them right here in my pocket. - but where could they be? - i must have dropped them when i put george down in the basement. - well, hurry up and get them. - yes, we have to get them. the police would certainly figure things out if they saw those. - well, go on and get them. - i don't think i can bear to look at him. - oh, don't be stupid. - i can't. i can't do it. - oh, give me that. besides being stupid you're a coward. (dramatic music) (gas blowing) i can't find them. - operator. - operator. would you give me the police department? - [officer] police department, officer smith. - oh, hello, officer, this is george martin. my wife asked you to phone me. - [officer] man with the asthma? - yes, that's right. - [officer] car's on its way now, sir. - well, you can find something more important to do. - i can't find them! - i've just spoken with my wife, and she's okay. i'm sorry, you know what a fuss wives make over these things. - [officer] she sounded pretty excited. okay, huh? - yeah, she's okay now. she's quieted down. well, thank you much, officer. she won't be bothering you for a while. - [officer] thanks for calling, sir. (dramatic music) (eva coughing) (door knob rattling) (eva coughing) - [eva] (banging) you let me out. will you let me out? (banging) (eva coughing) - colin was apprehended. i think, it is worth mentioning that he was tried in the state that dispenses poetic justice. he went to the gas chamber. this concludes my portion of the program. i shall return next week with another story.

what do you mean? i gave them my money. you didn't take it out of my purse? -no. i'm missing five dollars. well, you probably spent it. forgot all about it. hello? yes, yes, yes, he is, just a moment, mr. phillips. bill, mr. phillips. come on. hello, mr. phillips. oh, yes, yes, we are, thank you very much. well, i imagine so. i'm eddie. it's nice to meet you, don't you think you should knock instead of scratching like a dog? i am a dog. good for you. no, i'm just kidding. is there anything you want? no. why, you need any help? you know, go to the store for anything? well, eddie, that's very sweet of you, but i don't think so, maybe another time. well, be sure to bring your wife, aren't you? would you like some hard candy? sure. better ask your father, he don't want to spoil your lunch. your dog's still tied up out there. can i walk him for you? goodbye. mr. nelson said it'd be okay. yeah, that's nice, eddie, why don't you do that? well? nothing, just, you know, he wanted to know if we got in all right, if we needed anything for the house. well, he's going out of his way to be nice to you. that means he's got plans for you. don't snap at every little bone that guy tosses our way. he's got no plans for me except to keep me right where i am, under his thumb. well, at least we can hope work on him a little. ah, jan, that's not me. i'm no wheeler and dealer. i can't manipulate people. you don't know who you are or what you can do until you try. the next time you want to give somebody a tip and i start behaving like the queen of the shrews, you just haul off and drop me with a left hook. oh, perk up. this is our day. this is the house we have been dreaming about, and now here it is, our house. now, this house is going to give you just the lift you need. just one little push, and then you'll be project chief, and then the planning board, and then who knows. charlie? i let the boy next door walk him. hey, take it easy, pal. i just painted that garage last month. your boy has my dog in there. okay, eddie, open up. all right, boy, what are you doing? just walking the dog. in the garage? i'm just showing him your new forest green sports car, dan. you know, i show everyone your new sports car, even dogs. well, mrs. nelson said i could walk him. isn't that right, mr.nelson? you're all right, huh? he said your wife let him walk the mutt. is that right? uh, yeah, sure. well, then, what's the big fuss? no, it's just that... -anything wrong with walking a dog? i mean, the way you were banging at that door, you shook me up a little, buddy. he was howling like he might have been hurt. well, i guess he was scared of the dark. he pulled away from me and started running around in circles. it's a real crazy dog, scared of the dark. jack, lunch is ready. i'd better buzz. so don't forget to come over later. you're having a rough day, boy. you're going to need a little pick-me-up. see ya. okay, eddie, come on. eddie. haven't you had dinner? come on, come on, come on. come on. way to go. no, no, no. let's have a baby. the things you think about while you're making dinner. i'm serious. fine. well, you're in a good mood. i finally bearded the lion in his den. the library organization. you showed it to phillips? and i have something to show you. yeah, i left something out in the car. oh, what did he say? don't keep me in suspense. bill? i caught him in my glove compartment, stealing the parking meter money. he's the one that stole my five dollars, that little brat. well, you better go up and tell his parents. well, i don't know, honey. but we're going to have to live next door to those people a long time. i know that, but you just can't let it go. let him think he can get away with... did you ever see anything? billy's a disturbed child. look at these. he's weird, all right. a child like that could be dangerous. well, he may be going through a stage. adolescents, fantasy worlds, they grow out of it. we just can't let it go. well, do we have to tell the standers? maybe it'll all blow over if i just talk to the boy. you better do it now. oh, bill, jack's not home yet. he's breaking in a new salesman. is eddie around? i just wanted to see him out here for a few seconds. eddie? i'd ask you to come in, but the house is a mess. eddie! he ran in just a second ago. oh, he's probably in the garage. it's a riot. that garage is his second home. well, keeps him out from underfoot. he plays at driving his father's sports car. you know kids. thanks, barbara. i'll check the garage. anything i can do to help? no, no, it's nothing important. well, i'll tell jack you were asking for him. eddie, uh, now this is just between us. i'm... i'm not trying to scare you, and i'm not going to punish you. i just, uh, want to talk to you, as if you were my boy. do you understand? now, look, uh, eddie, what you've done is wrong. we both know that, but there's no reason to make a lot of trouble over it. because, you see, i think that you and i can be friends. huh? maybe you'd, uh, like to come with me next time i go fishing up in the mountains. would you like that, ed? okay. i won't ask you for the money you took that first day out of mrs. nelson's pocketbook. we'll forget that, and maybe you can just help me with a few little jobs down in the workshop. but i do want you to show that you trust me. so give me back what you took just a few minutes ago, and we'll wipe the slate clean. i never took nothing. eddie, now, don't lie to me, because i caught you in the car red-handed. i never took nothing. i was just looking at your dirty old car. don't lie. you're the liar. what are these? what about these, ed? are these lies, too? now, look, can't you see i want to help you? you're a dirty liar. all right. this thing's going to end right here and now. you listen to me. i'm going to talk to your father. you say one word to him. i'll kill your dog. listen, you so much as touched charlie, and i'll give you a beating you'll never forget. you hear me? i'll kill him. i'll kill your dog, then i'll kill you. hi, beautiful. happy home? he's upstairs. well, it's nothing important. i got a real jolt today for taking away my territory and giving me the whole district. district sales manager. how about that? hear that, buddy? not bad for a little boy next door, huh? listen, i take the whole bunch of us out on the town to celebrate, but barb is whining about me not spending enough time at home. so what do you say you all come over to our place tonight and we'll swill a little champagne and play spin the bottle, huh? hey, you better get back. wife's in one of her moods. jack, can you spare a second? this is pretty important. sure. what's the problem? it's eddie. i had a little talk with eddie today. i know. he told me. he told me the whole thing as soon as i got home today. i don't like it. i was willing to let it go this time, but since you brought it up. okay. let's get one thing straight. i'm the kid's father. if anything's wrong, you tell me. i'll punish him, not you. but i never punished him. you tore a couple of buttons off his shirt. you pinched his arms. well, i held him and i had to talk to him, that's all. all right. we won't make a big thing out of it. just remember, i'm his father. fine. but what are you going to do about it? what do you mean? what am i going to do about him? i'm not going to do anything about him. here. what about these? you told me about that. some other lousy kid gave him that garbage. these are typewriter second sheets. they've got your company's name on them. so? the other kid made him get them out of my desk. just look at them. you don't have to be a psychiatrist to see what a sick boy you've got. what do you mean? just look at them. you look at them. my eddie had nothing to do with it. he swore to me. when he was only four years old, that kid got his in a way he'll never forget. and do you know from that day to this, that kid has never lied to me? he knows better than to lie to me. now you understand, right? no need to ever bring it up again. sometimes it's good to bring these things out in the open. you know, get it off our chests. that way there's no hard feelings. okay, buddy. i'll see you after dinner. jack? don't make a mess. thanks, abe. if we could take a half a day every day, this would be a decent job. see you in the morning. honey, i'm home. janet? most people like to patronize their local stations. to assure everyone that they are doing just that, we have the following station identification. for years, the producers of television stories have been striving for greater and greater realism, while the commercials have been slowly becoming more and more fantastic and incredible. these two forces have been moving inexorably toward each other, until our viewers can no longer distinguish between reality and illusion. as any lay psychologist knows, this is extremely serious. one not only must have a program in order to tell the players, but if you aren't careful, one of the players will sell you something. therefore, be warned, we now have a minute of fact followed by two acts of fiction. bill, he's coming over. well? swear this boy had nothing to do with it. says he was with him all afternoon. we told you he'd say that. that's what he said to me on the phone. the fact remains, you didn't actually see the child kill your dog. if you want to go any further with this, i'm afraid your husband's going to have to come down to the precinct and sign a complaint. bill? your neighbor made some charges of his own. says you've been picking on the boy, bothering him, slapping him around. we'll have to look into that, too. -oh, that's ridiculous. that's what he says about your dog story. it's your word against his. and that makes me furious. can't you see that he's lying? don't blame me, lady. i'm just doing my job. i'll wait in the car for your husband. never mind. i'll drop the charge. yeah, maybe that's better all around. he killed charlie. i know. so what do we do now? what can we do? sell the house? run away. it's not running away, it's just being sensible. yeah. the only rational thing to do is stay away from that little monster and keep him away from us until we can move out. little monster? i wonder if it's that simple. don't waste your sympathy on him. what is the matter with me? what? as soon as that cop started talking about what stander said i did to eddie, you know, i just sat there like a criminal. i was scared. that kid, eddie. i tried to reach him. i... i don't know. like you said, i'm scared of my own shadow. honey, honey, don't say things like that. you're not like that. you're not like that at all. well, i'm going up, honey. why don't you get into your pajamas and i'll fix us something to eat. no, no thanks. it's no trouble. jan, please stop protecting me. don't make it easy for me to be weak. is that who i am? the great earth mother smothering you in her embrace? i didn't mean it that way. i was just talking to hear myself talk. remember our honeymoon when i wore this to dinner at the lodge? oh, you preserved the shamrock. you said it didn't suit me. not at all the kind of thing for your grimly conservative young husband. you see, even then i was a terrible shrew trying to run your life. good luck, charm. at least that's what my father said it was when he gave it to me. i was 12. that's when he disappeared. six months later, i got a christmas card from the other end of the world, but i never heard from him again. you know, for the longest time, i thought it was something that i'd done that drove him away. and then i'd take out this solid gold hunk of charm, and i'd look at it and think, he must have loved me, or he never would have given it to me. but i didn't really believe it. i know it's childish, but i used to think, if i had a boy someday, i'd give this to him, and i'd make it mean more than just a gaudy piece of junk because i'd be there whenever he needed me. kids need a father. that's why i don't want children.i just don't think i'm good enough. sweetheart, what kind of a thing is that to say? it's true. look what happened today. charlie dead, eddie... i feel guilty about that boy. i don't know why, but i do. i wanted to help him, and i couldn't. why is it that i can't just once take my life and shake it and make it what i am ment to be. you can't lie beside a man for six years and not know what kind of a man he is. you're a wonderful husband, and you are going to be a wonderful father. hello? oh, yes, just a moment, mr. phillips. he's down in the basement. yes, just a moment. bill? bill? mr. phillips is on the phone. saturday? sure, mr. phillips. i'll be there. right. goodbye. hey, honey? he wants me to join him and mr. tabor in a round of golf. when?  -right away. he says they're interested in the reorganization plan and want to talk to me about it. oh, honey, that means they're excited. they can't even wait till monday. i don't know, honey. i'm afraid to hope. bill? you've got to have your golf shoes. can't look like a peasant. thanks. good luck and knock them dead. jen? listen, why don't you come along with me? we'll make a day of it. honey, i can't. i've got a house to clean. besides, how's it going to look, you showing up at a business conference with the great earth mother trailing beside you? would you do something i want for a change? what's the matter with you? i don't want you here alone. oh, bill, that's ridiculous. don't think eddie's a danger to me. he killed charlie. that's the act of a nasty spiteful little brat. that doesn't mean he's a potential murderer. look, jen, i just don't want you here alone. anyway, it is their problem, not ours. there is nothing to worry about. besides, they're away next door. honey, i'll lock all the doors if it's going to make you feel better. now, come on, don't spoil this lovely day. give me a smile, a kiss, and get the heck out of here. call me from the club, so i'll know when to start dinner. how is she? she's resting. i gave her sedative. she'll be fine now, but it was a terrifying experience. it's going to take a little while for her to shake the effects. why didn't you call me sooner? she wouldn't let me. bill, jen told me everything that's been going on since you moved in here. so i phoned next door, and the father, stander, hung up on me. i had him take off in his sports car, so i called his wife. she swore that  hadn't seen the boy, that the husband was out looking for him in the neighborhood. i explained to her that they should surrender him to the police, because i was going to make a full medical report to the juvenile bureau. now, that boy obviously needs psychiatric help. psychiatric help? you sound like me. oh, lillie livid bill, where there's no such thing as a bad boy routine. what good is psychiatric help when you've got a little monster like that running around loose? what's he going to do next? who's he going to kill, huh? maybe your little daughter? easy, pal. the state you're in. -don, i've had it. this time, i'm going to do something. it's all right. it's all right, sweetheart. it's just stander in the lousy sports car. come on. bye-bye. i'm fine, really. i know. i know. you rest. i'll be downstairs if you need me. where are you going? please, don't go over there. i have to. please? i have to, jan. what do you want? if it's about that ridiculous charge against eddie, see my lawyer. where is he? where is eddie? i don't know, but it's a lie. i know he couldn't have done a thing like that. i told him never to go near your place again, and that boy obeys me. i mean, he learned his lesson early, and he knows. what do you mean he knows? all you've done all his life is spoil him, protect him, make excuses for him. what kind of a father are you? don't tell me i didn't raise him right. i made him, lord. i made him. he was four years old, and i caught him in a bare-faced lie. i forget what it was, but it was a dirty little lie. i said to him, eddie, every time you lie to me, i'm going to slap you across the face as hard as i can. and i slapped him right across the face, as hard as i could. you know what that little idiot did? he tried to hit me back. so i said to myself, you just nipped this right in the butt. you just show him that he's never, and i mean never, to raise a hand to his father again. i dragged that kid over to the stove. we were in the kitchen seat, and there was a big pot of boiling water on the burner. i took that kid's hand, the hand that he hit me with, and i forced it down into the boiling water. that may sound cruel to you, but do you know that that  kid has never lied to me from that day to this? i mean that kid has never lied to me. now you know, right? now you know why my eddie never could have done anything wrong. when i came in here just now, i was looking for a little monster. i mean, i felt i wanted to kill him with my bare hands. and now all i know is that he needs help. and if you won't give him help, i guess i feel responsible enough to know it's got to be me. if i won't help him, what are you talking about? something's gonna happen between you and eddie, and then it'll be too late. you can stand there, and you can yap yap yap until you're blue in the face, but he needs your help. he needs this. that's what he needs. that's all he ever needed. he's gonna change. he's gonna straighten out. if everybody just get off my back, i'd solve this thing. jack, he's a tormented little boy. will you shut up? will you just shut up? don't you think i know? don't you think i live with that kid, see him watching me all the time, defying me with his eyes, creeping around like a little animal? what do you want me to do,  put him away somewhere? he's my own flesh and blood. he's gonna be all right. we just keep him in line, see? we just keep him in line. we just keep it hushed up, see? and he'll grow out of it. he's got to. he's mine. whatever else he is, he's mine. the car. he's wearing brown, my sports car. he's got something in his hair. water. there. i can't breathe. he's trying to kill me. jack. open this door, jack! eddie! eddie! open this door! open up, i said! eddie! eddie! no, jack! eddie, don't. i wanna help you. i'm your father. i wanna help you. you help him? how can you help him? i had to call them. they're here to take my baby. it's all right, eddie. it's all right. the police won't hurt you. they have doctors who can help you. help you change the way you feel inside. hey. eddie. look. see? i wanna give you this. it's supposed to bring a person luck. my father gave it to me a long time ago and i wanna give it to you. here. and maybe it'll remind you that you can count on me as a friend. always. just as you can count on your mother and your father. your dad loves you, eddie. let me take him. i'll take him. my baby. my baby. mother loves you, baby. just let me have him for a minute. go on. stay with him. he needs you, jack. hey, we don't need that ladder. send her home. throw that hose there, will ya? well, we got a lick now. what do you figure? a fire bug or what? the cop says a kid who lives here did it. wanted to burn up his old man's sports car. boy, how crazy can you get? i should be pleased with this amazing response, but i'm not getting what i anticipated. unfortunately, it's turning out to be oil. we have only a little bit of story left this evening, and that seems to consist of small segments of next week's show. we shall show it to you in a moment."

0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"captain's log, stardate 44932.3. the enterprise is preparing to enter the mar oscura an unexplored dark-matter nebula. commander data is modifying several of our photon torpedoes for an experiment designed to elicit more information about this unusual phenomenon. the initial dispersal pattern should not be more than seven kilometers in diameter. jenna? oh. uh, 6.8 kilometers. that should suffice. is there something occupying your thoughts, jenna? you seem somewhat subdued today. i bumped into jeff again in the turbolift this morning. he asked me out to dinner. what was your response? i told him i'd think about it. as you requested, i will now remind you of the reasons you decided to end your relationship with jeff. i guess i asked for this. go ahead. you objected to the fact that he seemed unwilling to set aside sufficient time for you. you said he was unresponsive, that he never did ""the little things."" you disliked the sound he made when he ate his soup. okay, okay. i remember. this is the third time i have refreshed your memory. do you wish to rescind our agreement? no. no, it's for my own good. it's just so easy to forget. hand me the sequencer. throughout history, many lovers have suffered the same difficulty. anne boleyn was quite distressed that henry vlll preferred the company of his huntsmen over that of his wife. since when did you develop an interest in romantic historical figures? six weeks ago, when you and jeff dissolved your relationship i saw an excellent opportunity to study that aspect of human intimacy. as your friend, it is my responsibility to be supportive in times of need. that's, uh... that's very sweet, data. data to bridge. we are ready to begin the first illumination test. acknowledged. all science stations stand by. we're about to light up the nebula. mr. worf? launch bay one shows ready, commander. fire torpedo. it's beautiful. like watching fireworks when i was a little girl. **bravo. that was wonderful. really? oh. really. wonderful. thanks. is something wrong? my tempo was way off. i felt like i was rushing through the whole piece. i do not believe that is so. your rhythmic control has improved markedly. i heard no fluctuations during the performance. well, maybe, but i ruined the coda. i got confused with the phrasing again. and i kept breathing at the wrong times. the contrapuntal nature of the composition is most demanding. we will give more attention to the rhythmic patterns during our next rehearsal. however, i am quite certain the audience was oblivious to such nuances. they seemed to enjoy the performance thoroughly. thank you, data. you're very generous. every night, miles leaves his socks on the floor. when we got married i made the mistake of picking them up a few times. then i realized, if i kept it up i'd be doing it for the rest of my life. so i stopped, figuring he'd get the point and do it himself. one night goes by... two... a week... ten days! by now, there's a pile of socks half a meter high. oh, come on. it wasn't half a meter. after two weeks, i couldn't stand it anymore. i bundled them up and put them in the cleaning processor. and i'm still doing it. and a very good job she does of it, too. keiko, you sound just like data. he came over to my quarters the other day to give me a music lesson, and he said the funniest thing. how did you put it? about, um, about the mess? i believe i observed that you seem to have an aversion to orderliness. but it was not intended as a humorous remark. so, before we started he gallantly offered to help me straighten up. and a very good job i did of it, too. report, mr. data. i have nearly finished compiling readings of our most recent illuminatory burst. dark matter density is nearly one order of magnitude higher than in similar nebulae. life-forms here may have developed in ways never before observed. interesting hypothesis. are there any m-class planets we could check out? several, sir. the nearest is approximately three light-hours from our present position. it's worth a look. we'll continue our survey along the way. let's increase the flow rate and see if that helps. sometimes in the summer, we'd go on cookouts... just my little brother and me and my mother. she was hopeless without a replicator but we didn't care. children often do not develop discerning palettes until well beyond adolescence. it wasn't that. it's just that we felt so good being together you know, as a family. we didn't have much of that after my father died so those times were really special. i wish we were back there now, you and i. the unidirectional nature of the time continuum makes that an unlikely possibility. that's what i love about you, data. you make me laugh. i don't know why i keep falling for the wrong men. why can't i fall for somebody like you? you're perfect. that is not true. i have no human feelings. but you give me so much. you spend time with me when i'm lonely. you encourage me when i'm down. no man has ever been kinder to me. those are the things that matter. i better be going. with your permission, commander. permission granted. i don't know if you're aware of this but you're very handsome. i'll see you tomorrow. hello, data. would you like to try something new? it's a concoction i heard about on prakal ii. i think it's wonderful, but i need a second opinion. 87%% % saurian brandy. targ milk and denevian mead comprise the rest. there is an unusually high concentration of fructose compound and monosaccharides. too sweet? data, if i didn't know you better i would say you were a little... preoccupied. lieutenant d'sora just gave me what could be considered a very passionate kiss in the torpedo bay. really? and...? i was intrigued. jenna seemed to be displaying genuine affection for me. well... what do you think of her, data? i find her to be a competent officer highly motivated though somewhat lacking in her understanding of the theory underlying the dilithium matrix application. i meant personally. i look forward to the time we spend together. well, then it seems the next move is yours. what are you going to do? i do not know. i have no experience in such matters. i require advice. don't look at me. no, no, data. i simply mean that i can't give you any advice here. it's not good to advise people about their first love affairs. that's kind of something people have to figure out for themselves. but i am not capable of love. then it's going to be a very unique experience. data? missing someone? i found spot wandering through the corridor two sections away. thank you. forget to secure the door when you left? the door sensor is programmed to recognize only humanoid forms for entrance and egress. spot could not have triggered the mechanism. maybe somebody came in while you were away. let him out by accident. has anything been disturbed? it does not appear so. computer, has anyone been in my quarters in the last 12 hours other than commander la forge or myself? negative. that's pretty strange. you know, to be on the safe side, maybe i should report a possible unauthorized entry to security. geordi? hmm? may i ask your advice... in a personal matter? sure, data. should i pursue a relationship with lieutenant d'sora? i thought she and jeff arton... they have discontinued their association. she has made the first move in initiating a relationship with me. what should i do? boy. if she's just coming out of a bad situation... you know, sometimes it takes people a while, data. but then if they just jump right into another relationship... you see, that can be trouble. unless, of course, she's really ready and then, well, i guess it depends on whether or not you're really serious. this can be a little complicated. listen, my advice is... ask somebody else for advice. at least someone who's got more experience at giving advice. i think you should be careful. this isn't just some experiment you're running, data. jenna is a living, breathing person with needs and feelings that have to be considered. then you do not believe i should pursue this any further? i didn't say that. i just want you to be aware that this is unlike any other more casual relationship that you've attempted. i have studied much human literature on the subject of love and romantic liaisons. there are many role models for me to emulate. ultimately, jenna will care for you for who you are not what you imitate out of a book. my programming may be inadequate to the task. we're all more than the sum of our parts, data. you'll have to be more than the sum of your programming. klingons do not pursue relationships. they conquer that which they desire. however... lieutenant d'sora serves under my command. if she were mistreated i would be very displeased... sir. i understand. i think you should pursue it. first of all, she's a beautiful woman. she seems to be crazy about you. jenna has clearly demonstrated how she feels about me but i am not capable of returning those feelings. data... when you get involved with another person there are always risks... of disappointment, of getting hurt. i cannot be hurt, but she can. jenna knows that and she has obviously decided to take the chance. data, when it really works between two people it's not like anything you've ever experienced. the rewards are far greater than simple friendship. how far, sir? that's what i'm hoping you're going to find out. captain? i am seeking advice in how to... yes, i've heard, data and i will be delighted to offer any advice i can on understanding women. when i have some, i'll let you know. second officer's personal log, stardate 44935.6. after conferring with my colleagues regarding the nature of romantic love in general and my own situation in particular i have reached a decision. oh, they're lovely. come in. what are they? a variety of crystilia. their fragrance is an evolutionary response to the acrid nature of the atmosphere on telemarius iv. you silver-tongued devil. um, why don't i find a place to put these? which won't be that easy. ah. it seems your quarters have reverted to their earlier state of disorder. i know. i'm hopeless. there. they're beautiful, data. it's really sweet of you. commander riker suggested this particular flower. he said it had worked for him in the past. you didn't talk to the entire ship about us? no. in actuality, less than one percent of the enterprise crew was involved. ah. it was necessary to balance theory with experiential referents. both are required for a program of this nature. computer, decrease illumination level by one-third standard lux. uh, this is all part of a program? yes. one which i have just created for romantic relationships. so i'm, uh... i'm just a small variable in one of your new computational environments? you are much more than that, jenna. i have written a subroutine specifically for you... a program within the program. i have devoted a considerable share of my internal resources to its development. data... that's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me. estimated time of arrival, mr. data? we will reach the class-m planet in approximately 11 hours, sir. you have the bridge, number one. picard to lieutenant worf. yes, captain. would you step into my ready room, please? and bring a tricorder with you. aye, captain. captain? what do you make of this? i am puzzled, sir. so am l, mr. worf. the only detectable bioelectric residuals are your own. you did not... no, i did not. well, perhaps we have a poltergeist. sir? a mischievous spirit. sir? perhaps not. i cannot explain how an intruder entered this room. but i recommend that we go to red alert. not yet. then i will order one of my officers to stand watch. worf to ensign... that's all right, mr. worf. i think, for now circumstances warrant caution, nothing more. as you wish, captain. enter. i know. it's a little unexpected. you are correct. i did not anticipate your arrival until 1900 hours. well, i couldn't wait. um, i wanted you to have this. you have often expressed dissatisfaction with the spartan nature of my quarters. is this an attempt at embellishment? the cat's out of the bag. spot? no, i mean you've caught me in the act. i'm just trying to brighten things up around here. it's tyrinean. what do you think? its line is both fluid and formal yet retains an unpremeditated quality. the tactility of its surface embellishment is evocative of the neo-primitive period in tyrinean blade carving. um, i hadn't thought of it in that way. i'm sorry. don't let me interrupt. as you wish. uh, data? yes? the book of love, chapter four, paragraph 17. when your girlfriend arrives with a gift stop whatever it is you're doing and give her your undivided attention. i should not have resumed my painting. no. despite your suggestion that i continue. exactly. i have much to learn. um, why don't we start with this? a critical analysis isn't necessarily the best response to a gift. perhaps if i looked for a suitable place to display it. much better. the ambient light in this location accentuates its contours. however... a gift should not necessarily be placed according to aesthetic criteria. a more central location would give added meaning. data, what's important is that you're trying. you don't know how much that means to me. why don't you go back to your painting? oh, i really mean it this time. i'll see you tonight. riker to captain picard. i think you'd better come out here, sir. acknowledged. we've reached the designated coordinates. but the m-class planet? it's gone. are you sure there was no malfunction in the sensors? the lateral em scanners register radiation levels indicative of a class-m planet. sir... mr. data, run a full systems diagnostic. warning. atmospheric decompression in bridge observation lounge. environmental compensation sequence has been initiated. i am not registering a hull breach. scan for life-forms. none, sir. captain, standard air pressure has been reestablished in the observation lounge. let's have a look. mr. data? captain. i do not understand. you picking anything up, data? i detect no unusual readings along standard parameters. curious. the transparent aluminum alloy of this window is exhibiting a pattern of transient electrical currents. explanation. i have none. the rate is characteristic of a subspace distortion but i am picking up no evidence of a subspace field. we'll hold position while we seek an explanation for these anomalies. let's divert all our resources to that end. honey, i'm home. hi. hi. any luck with your diagnostic? negative. we found no malfunctions. we did a full security sweep. nothing. may i... get you a drink, dear? well, yes. i'll... i'll have a calaman sherry. excellent choice. i'll join you. computer two... calaman sherries. would you care for some dinner, as well? oh, i'm too tired to think about what i want. maybe later. whatever you wish, dear. there we are. uh-uh... darling, you remain as aesthetically pleasing as the first day we met. i believe i am the most fortunate sentient in this sector of the galaxy. now... you... relax... put your feet up... and i will take care of everything. i could organize your closets for you. i have found that by grouping apparel first by function then by color, from light to dark one can more easily find one's desired choice. data... that's all right. you don't have to do that. but i am happy to do it. please, just put them down. what do you wish me to do, dear? am i not paying enough attention to you? oh, no. that's not it, um... perhaps i am not giving you enough compliments. your hair is looking particularly silky tonight. data, there's just something strange about the way you're acting. am i not behaving as a solicitous mate? well, yes, but... tending to your every need? what's wrong with you tonight? my most recent self-diagnostic revealed no malfunctions. perhaps there is something wrong with you! i have never seen you behave so foolishly. why are you doing this? you don't tell me how to behave. you're not my mother. what? you are not my mother. that is the appropriate response for your statement that i am behaving foolishly. data, i think you should just leave. you do not wish to continue our lovers' quarrel? is that what this is? in my study of interpersonal dynamics i have found that conflict, followed by emotional release often strengthens the connection between two people. but there's something so forced and artificial about the way you're doing it, data. it's just not the real you. with regard to romantic relationships there is no real me. i am drawing upon various cultural and literary sources to help define my role. kiss me. what were you just thinking? in that particular moment i was reconfiguring the warp field parameters analyzing the collected works of charles dickens calculating the maximum pressure i could safely apply to your lips considering a new food supplement for spot... i'm glad i was in there somewhere. a complete sensor scan of the planet and three survey probes came up with no surprises. no signs of life. nothing out of the ordinary. seven more unusual incidents have been reported. no casualties or damage. we can only state that a subspace effect seems to exist within this nebula. after i have made further analysis i may be able to adjust the ship's sensors to locate and identify the anomaly. the ship's at risk as long as we're sitting here. we could continue the investigation outside the nebula. agreed. ensign mcknight plot the most direct course. ahead warp one. aye, sir. engage. captain... captain, explosive decompression on deck 37. bridge to la forge. damage report. we're showing damage between decks. we haven't localized it yet. thorne, are you all right? yes, sir. la forge to bridge. a cryogenic control conduit just blew out on us. i almost lost a man. ensign, full stop. aye, sir. la forge to bridge. go ahead, commander. i think we have some structural damage between decks 36 and 37. i'd better go check it out. van mayter, you take access tube 23-m and look at those bridge connectors. thorne, i'll cover the aft section. you go down... captain's log, supplemental. this series of unexplained events has now resulted in the death of a crewman. but it appears that mr. data may have an explanation. during the last occurrence i was able to confirm one of my hypotheses. the unusual preponderance of dark matter in this nebula is causing small gaps in the fabric of normal space. as the enterprise moves through this nebula it is colliding with these deformations. so every time we hit one, part of the ship momentarily phases out of normal space. or when one of them hits us. my readings suggest that the deformations themselves, are in motion. it's a good thing one of those pockets didn't pass through the photon torpedo casings or one of the matter/antimatter containment pods. question is, how do we get out? mr. data, could you reconfigure the sensors so as to detect these anomalies? yes, sir, but only at extremely close range. even at minimal speed, it would be almost impossible to maneuver the enterprise quickly enough to avoid them. a shuttlecraft is more maneuverable. he's right. if we could position the shuttlecraft far enough in front of the enterprise it could detect the pockets and allow us enough time to maneuver out of the way. we could give the shuttle control of our navigational systems. that way, the corresponding maneuvers would be virtually instantaneous. make it so. i'll do my pre-flight once i'm on board. not this time, will. i want you on the bridge. sir? i'm going to pilot the shuttle. captain, it is my duty as first officer to safeguard the lives on this ship, including yours. the enterprise can't afford to lose you. certainly not in this situation. i believe our best chance of escaping this situation is for me to pilot the shuttle. it's my ship, will. i've got to do this. sir. shuttle three to enterprise. telemetry link enabled. ship's computer is accepting navigational inputs from the shuttle. forward sensors are on line. ensign mcknight, plot a course for the shortest distance out of the nebula. plot laid in, sir. outer perimeter at 32 million kilometers. point one impulse, number one. acknowledged, captain. we're right behind you. riker to o'brien. lock on to the captain's communicator. i want to be able to pull him out of there in case we have to. aye, sir. changing course. new heading, 299 mark 029. main coupling is matching navigational inputs, captain. new heading confirmed. i missed it by less than a thousand meters, enterprise. advise your status. sensors indicate deformation passing 500 meters off the starboard bow. one down, captain. resuming previous course. confirmed. outer perimeter now at 30.1 million kilometers. changing course. heading 073 mark 288. new heading, 284 mark 01... enterprise,  i'm losing maneuverability. sensors indicate damage to the shuttle's starboard impulse nacelle, captain. i'm rerouting the secondary deuterium supply. switching to manual control. transceiver signal is down 42%%% . navigational inputs are not registering. we've lost our link, captain. you'll have to make course changes manually till we reestablish the connection. understood. mr. data, get us back on line. geordi, try boosting the power to the l-u bands. mcknight, increase the distance between the enterprise and the shuttle. we're going to need some more room to make manual adjustments. new heading, 299 mark 18. yes, sir. i've got it. course corrected. enterprise,  hard starboard! aye, sir. deformation impact on deck 15, science section. damage? reports coming in. minimal damage. mr. la forge i'm still having difficulty controlling the shuttlecraft. aye, sir. your krellide storage cells are losing their charge. maintaining manual control is going to become increasingly difficult. estimated distance to the nebula's perimeter? 4.7 million kilometers, sir. is there a way to transfer the microfusion thrusters so i can get a power boost? possibly. if you augment the thruster sequencing so that the inertial dampening fields... relative bearing 27... make that 285 mark 255. commander, the shuttle is out of control. mr. o'brien, do you have the captain's signal? i'm having trouble locking on, sir. sir, the shuttle's inertial dampeners have failed. it is breaking up. let's get him out of there. now would be a good time, mr. o'brien. did we get him back? aye, sir, we got him. i'm a little dizzy, number one, but none the worse. i'm on my way. acknowledged, sir. commander we are nearing the perimeter, one million kilometers away. all right. let's make a run for it. aye, sir. we're clear of the nebula, sir. ensign, plot a course for starbase 260. warp two. aye, sir. engage. enter. hi. hi. the place looks great. thank you. it is much less spartan, is it not? much less. it looks great. it really does. it looks... great. jenna, you are repeating yourself. i have often found this to be indicative of a mental distraction. is that a correct assumption in this instance? um, i'm afraid it is. then perhaps we should begin our meal. among humans, a low serum glucose level is often responsible... data, i think we should talk. could you sit down? um... i'm not sure how to begin. what is the subject? you and i. our relationship. yes? data... sometimes people blindly make the same mistake again and again. are you currently experiencing this phenomenon? i didn't see it until today. i got out of a relationship with an unemotional man and i got right back into another one with... with a man who's absolutely incapable of emotion. hmm. there does appear to be a recurring motif. you were so kind and attentive. i thought that would be enough. is it not? no, it's not, because as close as we are, i... i don't really matter to you. not really. nothing i can say or do will ever make you happy or sad or touch you in any way. that is a valid projection. it is apparent that my reach has exceeded my grasp in this particular area. i am, perhaps, not nearly so human as i aspire to become. if you are ready to eat, i will bring our meal. uh... no. that's all right, data. i'm going to go now. as you wish. jenna... are we no longer... a couple?

'cause i'm not going to hurt you, really i'm not. if you're not hiding from the police, then you must be from the hospital. i'm not going back there. i'm not gonna go back there. are they trying to make you? they're gonna be here any minute. they said i'm dangerous. they said i do terrible things to people, because if i did, i'd remember it. you can't do things and not remember them, i don't know. oh, i'm so tired. all i wanna do is rest. i've been running for hours and hiding and... you can't rest standing up in the hall. you better come into the living room. no, i can't. they'll see me oh, no, they won't. the blinds are closed. look, you don't need to worry. you can trust me. you won't tell them i'm here when they come, will you? no, i won't tell them. i know what it's like to be afraid of a place. come on. come on. be careful! there's no one out there. look, why don't you stretch out and rest? there's no time. they're right behind me. they're gonna be here any minute. even a few minutes would help. and i'll get you something hot to drink. why are you being so kind to me? i suppose i understand what it's like to be afraid. you know, you're luckier than i am. you're afraid of being shut up. and i don't even know what i'm afraid of, much worse. there's nothing worse than being shut up. nothing! oh, but you're wrong. don't you remember what it like was before, before you went into the hospital? you must have been afraid then, even if you didn't know i was always afraid of everything, of everybody. and... what's that? it's just the telephone. i left it off the hook. i... i was calling my mother when i heard you oh, that wasn't me. i didn't make any noise. i've been out there for a long time. and i was hardly breathing. and then, that cat got in here. and i got so scared 'cause she knocked and i heard you coming. i didn't know you were i didn't know it, either. you know, it's funny we can talk i don't even know your name. it's ted. ted lambert. mine's mary hadley. oh. now, why did i say that? it's summers. it used to be mary hadley, before i got married. where's your husband? oh, he's away on a trip, a business trip. then you're all alone? yes, i'm alone. ted, i wanna ask you something. wasn't there ever a time when you felt safe? i don't think so. oh. then you are worse off than i am. at least i can remember a time when i was. oh, it was a long time ago. i was just a little girl. you see, then, even if i was frightened of something, like i remember once i got lost, and a policeman found me and brought me home. i was crying and my daddy put his arms around me. sometimes i can still feel his arms. he said, ""don't cry, baby, you're safe now. ""you'll always be safe with mother and me. "" and i always was. i always was. well, then why are you afraid? because i'm alone. and they're not here with me. but your husband... oh, he doesn't understand. he's very kind and good, but he doesn't understand what it's like to be afraid. ted? i... i wanna tell you something else, something you mustn't tell anyone, either. i won't. i promise. i never wanted to get married. i only did it because my mother and daddy and arthur was so kind and generous, i knew he'd help me take care of them. and i thought they could stay with me, and then everything would go on i wish i could take care of you. i wish i could help you. oh, no, i don't think anyone can help me now. i don't think anyone can stop it from happening. i even know where it's going to happen. because i've dreamt about it, a lot of times. and it's always the same dream. why, i have bad dreams, too. mine's always the same dream. i'm always in my bedroom. that's what i meant before about saying i understood about being afraid of a place, because i'm afraid of my bedroom. i sometimes think, if i don't go there, only that's not really true. how can you remember what you dream? i can't ever remember. i wake up, and i know i've been dreaming i can't ever remember what it was. i guess because mine's always the same. i'm up there all alone, waiting for something, and there's a sound downstairs, and there are footsteps on the stairs. they come up very slowly, one at a time, till it reaches the door, and the knob turns, and the door i'd never know what it is, because that's when i always wake up. i wake up screaming. well, they say that dreams don't come true. oh, yes, mine will. well, maybe not if... they're here! they're here! they're here! it's all right. i won't let them in. don't be frightened. they're going to make you let them in to search, so they can find out if you're safe. you can hide in the back hall, where you were before, and i'll bring them in here first, go on, hurry. hurry. thank you. yes? sorry to bother you, ma'am. we're from state hospital? yes. one of the patients wandered away would you mind if we searched the house i don't see how that's possible. well, just to be on the safe side. it's quite all right with me. come in. thanks. you may as well start in the living room. it's right in here. no place he could hide in this room. i'm sure he's not here. i'll show you the rest of the house now, if you wouldn't mind. oh, my cat knocked it over. i just haven't cleaned it up yet. sorry to put you to so much trouble, ma'am, i appreciate it. funny, i was sure when i found that broken lock on the back door that he was here. it was nice of you to fix it. under the circumstances, it wouldn't be very safe but you're all right now. oh, yes, i'll be fine. thank you. good night. good night. long distance? i'd like to place a call to new york city, please. yes, the number is murray hill 30598. thank you. oh, but all the circuits can't be busy. oh, i see. well, will you call me back as soon as you can thank you. oh, here you are. i was worried about you when i heard that man from so i came back. mary? mary, don't look like that. it's me, arthur. hello, mary? mary, this is daddy. mary, answer me. are you all right, dear? yes, daddy. i'm all right now. now, i can come home. this concludes our play for tonight. unhappily for mary summers, however, there is more for she subsequently found herself in one of those institutions she had come to fear. next time, we shall be back with another story. until then, good night."

(dark dramatic music) (intriguing music) - invasion of europe, this is a momentous day to attempt to contact someone killed in the war. - can you, can you really? - please, dear. - soon enough we shall know if your son's spirit lives on. let us begin. a bayonet, a helmet, and a gun, these have become the objects of man's faith. - what happened to him? what happened? - i'm sorry, i try to do this as quickly as i can, but contacting a departed spirit is not easy. - we know that. we appreciate what you're doing. - nor is it guaranteed. i guarantee nothing, only my willingness to try. i need your willingness to trust me. - we do, we wouldn't be here if we didn't. - do i still sense some hostility in you? - oh no, none, he wants it too, don't you dear? he believes in you. - i cannot help anyone who doesn't want to be helped. mrs. thompson, on my right. mr. thompson, on my left. these are the objects of invocation, the presence of things common to last moments of the deceased, helps in contacting the departed spirit. we shall fill this room with the kind of things that surrounded your son's last living moments. (film rolls) - oh must you, must you? - there is no easy way, i'm sorry, we can stop. - no, please, go ahead. - in a moment you will hear the sounds of battle. they will come from a record player. there is no deception, no magic, no fraudulent means. these sounds are only recorded. (gunfire) we use the objects of war, the sounds of war, image of death in war, to invoke the medium of contact with private harry thompson. how did he die? he was missing in action. he was gone suddenly from this time, and that place, nothing to recall him. (bombs explode) was it by knife? or, was it by this weapon? (bombs explode) there was a sudden pressure, a light, a light filled the eye, and flooded the brain, a sound, a terrible sound. i feel the pain in my arms. the moment was then and he will speak. he will speak. i do not handle money, sir. mr. mcbain. - i am so grateful, it was my son. you found my son. - give it to my assistant. - may we come again, please? - well please telephone for an appointment. i'll help you as i can, but there's so many others. you must wait your turn. - thank you. - look at that man, he came in despising me and he goes out like a clod. i can't stand weak people. i can't stand them. - these people are different from the ones we used to work with, they have the worst unhappiness. - did you get all the newspapers? - [mcbain] yeah, i got 'em all. - then read me the lists. - for this week's casualties, the war department announces the following members of the army listed as dead, pfc thomas h. donne. - only those missing in action. - i still don't like using that kind. - it doesn't make much difference if you like it or - don't you treat me like a servant. - but you are. - i taught you everything about this racket. - profession, robert. - that's what you like to pretend, but it is a racket, a swindle, a con game as any i ever did. - i only obtained the more crude aspects of the profession from you. - everything, and i want you to stop pushing me around. - you taught me a series of halloween tricks, carnival mumbo-jumbo, i made it pay. - there'll still carny tricks. - they're science. - and you took them from me. - how could i possibly take from you? i have insight, you don't. i know about people's superstitions, desperation. i can read their weakness and fortify their strength. - haven't we made enough? all the people we've taken already? - [adelaide] helped. - taken, conned. - we haven't taken or used anyone. we've helped them. - used to be wealthy old dowagers who were on their last legs anyway, people with time to waste, that was different from this stuff-- - bereaved and despairing, we give them hope. widows and weeping mothers, we bring them their loved ones who've died on remote battlefields. we put their shattered bodies together. - i wish i understood you. i wish i knew what you want. - i want money. i want happiness. they're the same. - you've got money. - not enough, the war will be over one day. this is our last chance to cash in. now read me the list of those missing in action. - pfc timothy arlington, 927 north queens avenue. - that's not a good neighborhood. - wouldn't it be simpler to go back to the relatives of the men who've been killed, wouldn't it be easier to work them? - i told you, no. i am through being caught up on so many details, struggling to keep ahead of idiots who don't even know their own desperate need to be helped. - the war department has investigators. - with a man missing in action, who's to say whether my information about how he died is right or wrong? not even the war department. not even the men who are supposed to know. now go on with the list. - first lieutenant, john porter, 1438 williamsburg road. - which end of williamsburg road is that? - [robert] i don't know. - find out. (rotary dials) (phone rings) - operator, would you give me the phone number of a mr. porter, 1438 williamsburg road? yes. brighton, 24599, thank you. brighton, that's the north end above sunset. that's a rich section. - call him. call him, you know what to say. (rotary dials) (phone rings) - [porter] hello. - this is mr. porter? - [porter] yes, this is mr. porter. - this is the father of lieutenant of john f. porter? - i am his father, what is it? - this is the war department. - you found him? oh, i'd almost given up hope. you found my son alive? - i regret to inform you sir that your son is dead. (dark dramatic music) (moody dramatic music) - ah, ms. winters, i'm sorry i wasn't here to receive you, but i was detained. i had some business to attend to. - i have more than business to attend to, mr. porter. i have other people's feelings. - i said, i'm sorry, please sit down. - thank you. when i first called you i thought you said, you would want to talk and then make your decision about going ahead. - i wanted to. - well this is my third visit to discuss it. my third trip to help you decide if you wish to contact your son. - it takes time. - time to admit what i do is legitimate and worth a try? or, time to admit you need my help? - to trust what you do, ms. winters, requires faith. i need time to have that. - there's no reason to have faith in anything until it's proven itself. - i have never been to one of those things. - you said that the first visit, and the second, now this one, goodbye, mr. porter. - [porter] wait, please. - you've lost your only son. you've turned to friends, work, to your money. have any of those things helped? - [porter] nothing helped, nothing. - you wife is gone, many years. you raised a son yourself. you made a world for him he'll never have. you did all that, and this one last hope to ever know the sound of him, the reality of him, you toss aside. let me try to help you. at least let me try to find out how he died and where. - ms. winters, i have been a realist all my life. - this is real. - maybe. - what you mean is you hope so. you hope it's true. you hope it's real. - you're a very compassionate woman and an honest human being. - we'll start, now... here, here in this room, with daylight flooding it, where you can see everything i do, among the familiar objects of his life, the place in which he grew, objects can be a medium. in this room where the sound of a child's laughter, but of a father and son playing in loving roughness. from these sights and sounds of the past, we will, we must, we shall invoke your son's spirit. i hear a sound. i can't, a distant sound, i don't know. it's not a familiar sound. your son flew a plane, bomber? - yes, he did. - i hear, i don't know. i'm sorry, it's gone, it's lost. - and now? - i've failed, it won't come back now. - will you try again? - whenever you wish. - i want you to, just one more time. - but at my home, this is a place of the past, distant past, it doesn't let in the present. - all right, your home. (planes roar) - we invoke the sounds, the objects of a lost spirit, a young man, lost, lost where? where? (plane buzzes) (gun fire) i don't understand. i don't. - what is it? what is wrong? - it's so close, an imminent thing so close, so near, i sense it, but, but beyond me, just out of my reach. - you're not going to give up? - perhaps someone else can help you more. - no, but i've tried three times. - and each time, closer. - to what? - to... to my son, yes, closer to my son. - not if i can't break through. - [porter] you must try again and again. - and if i fail? - [porter] then again, until you succeed. (plane buzzes) (bombs explode) - the image is vague, it's not clear. the things of his death, they are wrong. no, no it was not in the sky or the earth. i hear a voice. it comes from the seas, from the water, from the deepest waters of the oceans. i call you, i beg you, i beseech you, through love of your father to ease his pain, to end his anguish, give a sign of love to your father, that you love him, show you love him. (plane explodes) - [john] the way i died, i was afraid. - who, who is it? john, is it you? who is it? - [john] afraid of dying, but now it is beautiful, the water, the peaceful water, we sailed you and i. the sea, the quietest sea, below the quiet sea there is rest and beauty, death is not terrible. - oh, thank god. - [john] do not lose me, father. do not lose me. (plane hums) - stay, please stay. - [john] do not lose me. - oh my son, my dear son. (dramatic music) ms. winters? ms. winters? ms. winters? - we did, we reached him. - yes, thank you, thank you. (dramatic music) - he's out there again. - really, for who long? - about half an hour, maybe. he wasn't there when i let our last client in. - his appointment is next. - no it isn't, he's a couple hours early. i don't like it. - well, he has nothing else to do. - yeah, but this has been going on for over a week. - only because this is where's he found a greater happiness. (doorbell rings) - think that's porter? - you'll let him in. - you've sort of taking on a personal feeling for him, aren't you? - answer the door. - you're gonna take him before his regular appointment? - will you answer the door? (doorbell rings) - i'm early, again. - come in, come in. i'm flattered that you've come so early. - well, to see you as well. - that's most gracious. we've been having wonderful success, haven't we? and i'm always delighted when the gift i have is successful. it's a good feeling. - you're a fine person. - well, i try to be. sometimes i'm not. sometimes i fail myself. and that's when astral communication is impossible, when i concentrate only on myself. - you're a rare human being. - why, thank you. - i recognize them. - how? - they're truly aware of other people's needs. - i try to be of help to everyone. - maybe too many. - why too many? how could i possibly help too many? - well, never mind, let's begin. - you're acting unusual today, mr. porter. is something wrong? - i said begin, no talk, just begin. - we'll see here, i offer my services but that doesn't give license to you or anyone else to-- - yes, you're right, i have no special prerogatives. - well, even you, considering the number of sessions we've had, it doesn't even give you that did you hear me? mr. porter? - i can't stand you spending so much time with others. - [adelaide] but it's my work. - i have offered your money, double you fee for extra time. - my work is very exhausting. i can just manage so many hours a day, just so many and no more. - i want all your time. - impossible. - why? - well, just the expense alone. - i can afford it. - i've never worked that way. - any fee you name. - i don't know if it can be done. - triple your fee. - i mean, i don't even know if it would count for much. - i must be with my son more, i must. - oh, but we'd be pestered all day long by other clients. they'd keep coming here demanding that i give them time. it's just as important to them as it is to you, mr. porter. - i know, i realize that. so you must come and stay at my home. - but mcbain, my assistant. - well, why do you want him? - because he's always been with me. - bring him, the both of you, come, live in my home. it's a huge house. since my wife died years ago, since she died, and now my son, i need your help. you can bring my son to me, you can, you can. please, please, i need you. (dramatic music) - of course, of course. (suspenseful music) - there can be serious disadvantages to being 10 feet for one thing i just dropped a quarter on the sidewalk. we shall continue our story after how local stations advise you who is bringing you our show. (moody dramatic music) - i put everything in your rooms. - [adelaide] thank you. - [porter] did they show you to your quarters? - yes. - are they satisfactory? - and if they're not? - well, we can always change the. - oh no, no, no, it's okay. it's just that i've never had rooms over a garage before. - oh, it is magnificent. - yes, you will be happy here. - i know. - i'd like to show you your suite. - a suite? - yes, i remodeled two rooms for you. - well, you're the most thoughtful man i've ever known. (dark dramatic music) is it all set up? - nope, i checked every electric circuit i could find. our speaker system doesn't fit into any of them. - well, if you need more time, i'll get him out of the house. - there are servants, remember? - all right, and servants too. - and it still won't work. - we'll think of something. - oh, what for? - so we can get what we want. - so you can get what you want. - all right, if you choose. - well, it's true isn't it? - i don't owe you anything. we stopped being more than business associates a long time ago. - you did, i didn't. - and i still like you, you know that. - yeah, but not enough, huh? - help me get what i want and you'll see. we'll be comfortable for the rest of our lives. - together? - maybe. - for good? - for a while, at least for a while. - i can get a portable sending-receiving radio. - couldn't anyone pick it up on its set? - no, no it's a wireless intercom system. i can fix it so it fixes to only broadcasts about 100 feet. we could put one anywhere in the house. - what if you get several units? - well what for? we only need one for sending, one for receiving. - not if you put one in the living room, one in the garden, and one in the study. - yeah, that's a good move, if he can take it. - it's what he wants. - i still say, only if he can take it. - i'll take care of him, you take care of the radio sets. - [porter] the servants are in their quarters. - well, that wasn't necessary, edward. i don't mind if they're about. - oh, but i do. this is an experience meant just for the two of us, and for my son. - the three of us. - none for you? - no, not now. to this place, john, this place, your father's house that you knew so well, and lived in with love. i bring you to this house of loving memory. can you hear us? we invoke no objects of war, but to forget war, to destroy death, we call you to the living. - [john] to my father's house? - this is a place you return to for your father. - [john] for my father, for you. - these rooms, to share with you, to share the place and time in which we move. - [john] to share. - [adelaide] and to share that place with you. - [john] this place, to share, with me. - [adelaide] for this moment, to be remembered, is your new world, as peaceful, as peaceful and contented. - [john] more peaceful, more than the world i left. more than the world. (dramatic music) - as if he were alive? - he is. - in that dress? - and this one. - i was so right to bring you here to stay, to stay always. - as long as i can. - as long as i need you? - yes. - each day my life becomes more wonderful because you make it possible, and more beautiful because you bring us together again. - because this is a home of love. there is nothing hostile, nothing antagonistic to send him from us. - nor to keep us from him. (dramatic music) - or to keep us from him. - i picked up the mail. - the servants do that. - yeah, well i've been doing it for the past few weeks. there's a letter for you. it's addressed to porter, but it's really meant for you, from the war department. i heard they were sending letters to relatives of servicemen killed in action. so, i've been watching for it. - what did it say? - warning against people like us, who contact the parents of casualty. - who could've told them? - nobody had to, it's routine. (birds chirp) - there's nothing to worry about. - he's given enough, or shall i say taken enough. i can see it in his eyes when you walk past him. - you're jealous. - you know, he sits up most of the night. i've looked in and watched. he sits downstairs and he looks up at your room, and sometimes he even takes a chair, and sits next to your door. - what of it? - he talks about you and his son, like the three of you were a family. - your jealousy is dangerous. - i'm telling you it's the time to lay off. it's time to clear out. - you would like me to run, to leave all this? well, i won't and you'll have to wait for me longer than you thought, much longer. - oh, i can wait, i've waited a long time already. - i'm going to marry him. - but, i've helped you. i've worked for you. i've risked everything for you. - [adelaide] you've been repaid. - i'd have made that kind of money working my on pitch. i love you. i stayed with you because i loved you. - you can still stay around. - oh no, no, no, not now i won't. - getting brave again, huh? this is a comfortable life. you'd throw it over for love? i'm not marrying for love. why should you throw all this away for love? - did he ask you to marry him? - speak up, robert, i can't hear you. - did he ask you to marry him? - no, but he will. - you're so awful sure of everything, aren't you? - because i read people's needs. i read his needs and supplied them, supply and demand. now he must hold on to me, because i'm the only person who can bring his son to him every day, like a clock. (sinister music) (moody dramatic music) (door knocks) what, who is it? - it's edward, may i come in, please? (uneasy dramatic music) i'm sorry, adelaide, i know it's the middle of the night but i had to talk to you. - oh please come in, don't apologize. - thank you. - [edward] do you always lock your door? - well yes, usually. - nothing could harm you in this house as long as i'm here. - then i shan't lock it again. - i couldn't sleep because i kept thinking about this wonderful month that we have spent. - it has been wonderful. - thinking how happy my son sounds. - he is in a world more peaceful than any he's known. - yes, that's it, happier than i've ever heard him, even more than-- - what are you thinking? - that i feel like a younger man since we've begun our life together. - time turns back when we're with our loved ones. time turns back. - and we become more hopeful. - to share your life with someone. - i have been sharing my life with you. - we've only worked together. - more than that. - because i wanted to help. - adelaide, do you remember what my son said? - why, yes. - he seems to know so much about you. - well, in astral telepathy there is communication beyond words. - my son is becoming very fond of you, i know it. i can tell by the sound of his voice. - you speak as if he were alive, like us. - isn't he? - well, yes of course he's like us. we're all as one, but we have a life in this world to live before the other, so much to live for. - can it compare to his world beyond the grave? - well, no, but we must wait our time. we cannot ignore this life, we're in it. we must live as best we can. - i've tried, with all my money, my time, my position, i have tried. it doesn't mean anything. it can't compare to his happiness. - well, but he would want you to enjoy all of this. he was cheated of it. he was cheated and you must enjoy it for him. - all this was for my son. - but you haven't lost him, through me you've regained him. - that's why all of this belongs to you now. - i'm only a kind of employee. - don't say that! - i'm paid a salary. - you're like a member of the family. - like, but not actually. there's a great difference. - you are the family, you, and john, and i. - john is a spirit now. - you, john, and i, one family again. - you speak as if i were your wife. i'm not, edward, i'm not at all. - you will be my wife. my dear, my wonderful wife. - kind, sweet, edward. (ominous music) what's wrong? - i sensed something, just now, odd. someone with us. - [adelaide] there's no one with us. - not as if we were in this room at all. - but we're here, here in this room, look about you, the table, the chairs, you know them. we've never left this room. - we were with my son. for the first time we were with my son. - no edward, no, it's not-- - as if he wanted us to be with him, to share our happiness. (sinister music) - i tell you, he's dangerous. - oh, i've seen many like this before. it's the shock of belief, the shock of faith and then it subsides. - will you stop talking like we're a religion. we're racketeers, honey, we're con artists. - you are. - he doesn't know what's real, or not. - look, you're jealous. - [edward] he is dangerous. - how? - i don't know how, exactly. - would he turn me over to the police? - more, there's something more. - maybe he'll demand his money back? - he's losing his reason. it's like he can't hear anything else, like-- - don't generalize, be specific. for once in your life be exact. - i don't know, i told you, i'm no doctor. - and you're frightened? - those are the ones who stay alive, the ones who know when to get scared. - it's incredible that i once thought you were not only smarter but much braver than i was. - if you're as smart as you think you are, you should get scared enough to run. - not until i have all this. - we could walk out that front door now. - don't you understand? i have to stay until i get what i worked for, just until them. - you are scared. - i'm going to marry him. (laughs) - you're really frightened. you're putting on an act! - nothing's gonna make me leave. (laughs) - you know i'm right! - coward. (slapping) coward. (dark suspenseful music) (wind gusts) (unnerving music) (door handle twists) (suspenseful music) - adelaide? - [adelaide] i'm not a sleep. - i've been thinking about you for hours. - i've been thinking about you too, i couldn't sleep. - adelaide, what does all this mean to you? - our marriage? - this house? - nothing without you. - my money? - only something to share, together. - [edward] nothing more? - you're my life. - you are my life, you and john. - why do you keep saying it, that way? - because it's true. - john is dead, he's waiting, but he's not with us, not really. - what is john to you? - a son, your son, and mine. - you love him as i do? - i've told you that i-- - why must we wait? - wait? - why must we keep him waiting? - [adelaide] you can't be serious? - but you said, you said, this world, this material world meant nothing without me. - no, no, edward, no, this is our world. - what is there to wait for? this place of evil, of corruption, you've said so. you've shown me that. - look, under strain and upset, things get distorted. - you have shown me the beautiful world that lies beyond the grave. - no, i didn't, i didn't. - you taught me faith, you taught me about the life beyond. don't lose that faith. don't be afraid of losing this world. john is waiting for us. (suspenseful music) - oh, this is the only world, the only one. there is no astral world beyond. none, it was a lie. - john's voice, a lie, my own son's voice? i would know his voice in a crowd, in eternity. - i'll show you, i'll show you it was a lie. robert mcbain, in his room, come, come to his room. - don't leave. adelaide, wait. (suspenseful music) (intense harrowing music) - robert, robert you've got to! (adelaide whimpers) (footsteps approach) - it was a lie, it was a lie.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"oh good evening. im sure there's a question in everyone's mind. you're all wondering how i have managed to overcome the help problem. the secret lies in offering fringe benefits. on the job training, things like that. these items don't cost much, and what i spend on them i save on costumes. seriously this is certainly not an honest picture of life in hollywood. we do believe in being comfortable while we work. but we never eat grapes during business hours. tonight's story is entitled the greatest monster of them all. which certainly should be a cue for the sponsors. the greatest monster of them all -knock it off can't you see im reading. -what's the matter, hal? there's got to be silence every time you stick your nose in the racing form? this isn't the racing for morty. this is a book on, you should excuse the expression, entomology. -enter what? -entomology stupid. -the study of insects. -insects? i don't get it. -either do i, but i will. gotta find me a bug. -so for this you need a book? -please... -good morning mr bellow. -morning. -take a look around. the joint is full of bugs. the fine movie studio you rented. when they built this place lionel barrymore was playing juveniles. never mind how it looks im getting it cheap. you get everything cheap, boss. this i got to hand you. when it comes to cheap you're a genius. yes every day and every way. 40 grand this one cost you and it grossed over a half a million. -well like i say pure genius. -knock it off. -find me a bug. -so what do you need a bug for? for the next movie stupid. bug's the box office. you want to make a monster movie today you gotta have a bug. you mean like a giant spider or a scorpion, huh? sure, only they all been used i need a new one. say, how about a giant cockroach? not bad not bad at all. no, i couldn't. ain't good taste. so let logan dream up something. -he's your writer, isn't he? -that's romney. didn't he almost win an oscar once. he used to be a real artsy craftsy. all i know is he likes cheap. oh hey freddy boy, we just been dropping your name. -how clumsy. -hey you loaded? no of course not. i never drink on the job. -only after. -so you're on the job. -show me the pages. -well i haven't been able to do anything yet mr billow. you said you'd have to decide on a giant insect. that's what's bogging him. get it. shut up. look you're such a hot shot rider. you'll find me a monster bug. that's your business. yeah i guess you're right that's my business all right fred logan boy monster bug finder. never mind with the sarcasm, all i want i it's your script... alright so sue me i haven't been able to think of a new type bug. all right so never mind the bug. let's play for the high school audience. oh you mean you want to change it to an adolescent theme now? no like i said high school kids. what do you say logan, think you can come up with a high school background? come on, we got all those kids young full of life. play against death. find me an angle. okay. i think i can. ernst von croft. ernst von kraft the greatest monster of them all. sure i remember. that's how they used to bill him back in the 30s. i haven't seen him around for years. he's been in retirement lately hal but this could make a great comeback vehicle for him. sure, that's the bit, the come back, milky to publicity. he's too all to act. -who cares? he's still a big name of the horror department. -i bet i can get him cheap. -oh look morty you wouldn't have to use him, him throughout the picture so he's just in one or two key scenes. you'll give me the treatment ill take care of bring von croft. -now we got something working for us. -darling they're playing our song. -i get rolling with it -marty. there's somebody id like to have you meet. have you got a surprise. morty lenton this is ernst von croft. a great pleasure mr lenton. morty is the name, we don't go for the formal bit around here. just one big happy family, hey hal? you make with the acting i make with a directing and no problem, see? our main idea is to bring in a picture as quickly as possible. -the less it takes, the better. -and cheaper too. oh i quite understand. ah things have changed since the last time i worked in this studio. -i made some of my biggest pictures here. -yeah sure. of course you might as well get one thing straight right now mr von craft. this isn't exactly going to be a big picture. strictly a low budget deal. but it can be a very good picture mr lenten. great films are not made with money. they are made with love with care. with integrity and together we can create a horror picture in the great tradition. not with the writer we got. he ain't no edgar albert poe. writers like paul, we can't afford anyway. -times change mr von croft. -do they? gentlemen in this very studio 30 years ago, i played a monster. i can make that monster walk again. fine, marvelous, bravo. that was wonderful mr von croft, don't you agree morty. -yeah sure. -oh ive been thinking  about my characterization. there are a few touches i might add. id like to use my own makeup. -wonderful go ahead. -maybe you could play it without teeth. a toothless vampire? wouldn't that be a little hard mr lenton. that morty is always in there with the rib. you'll go ahead mr von croft. wake up makeup any way you like mind waiting for me in the makeup room, ive got a few things to go for with more of course only take a minute. morty, morty... -where is he? -he's gone. well what do you think? -i told you to let me run a test on him first. -this guy is strictly cornball. -but when he did the monster for a... yah, don't tell me you went for a speech about the great tradition and all that jazz. you want the picture that's sales grosser. -not one of them kakamemi art form. -morty all right. do it your way. you haven't missed yet. how about some coffee? -hell good morning. -good morning. -let me see your makeup darling. -ready? -yeah just a minute morty. -como on  lara. bye-bye. -yes master. -ive been waiting for you boy. got that new dialogue for this scene? -right here. -let me see. okay. here darling, you and pops run through these changes, go ahead. mr von croft? rusty boy. von croft? -mr von croft? -yeah. don't be afraid my dear. there's no need to be afraid of me. -you smell of death. death? -i bring you life, eternal. no no, please no. one kiss and you shall join me to live forever. no no no please no. okay you got the idea. well you think it'll play well, freddie boy? oh, i think that mr von croft could inspire terror just by reciting the alphabet. well you two don't know each other do you? this is fred logan here at the screenplay. -very fine job mr logan. -mr von croft, -you and lara go over it again and think up some business huh? -yeah. -um, do you like? -von craft he looks great. -oh i never mind him i mean the set. oh the set oh oh well that dummy up there morty, that looks pretty horny. you know how the boss is about money. want you should pay 50 bucks to some stuntman just to hang there all day? morty these uh changes you had me making this scene, why all this dialogue? i thought it would play better with just action. hey never mind what you thought i want some close shots of von croft. why? it doesn't make any sense. i ain't asking for opinions what i want is cooperation. and you better give it to me freddie boy if you want to keep on eating. all right all right quiet everybody quiet. okay you two know what to do. lara... you stand over next to the grave. no no no not like that you're supposed to be a high school kid. like this. you're out in the graveyard alone at midnight. big deal. waht do a girl doing in a graveyard at midnight and alone yet? just do like the script calls for. and will you get rid of that gum? -yes master. -now mr van kraft... when she discovers you in the scene you are lying in the coffin. would you mind just trying it for size. -how does it feel, okay? -oh yes mr lenton. this will be a great picture a great picture. ive been away a long time but now, i have come home. hi kids long time no see. not since you wrapped up the picture. -how'd you like to write me another? -i wouldn't. -we'll see. come, let me pour you a drink. i figure we can bring in a sequel fast and cheap. i have instructed the graveyard set, we can get lara lee and old uh what's his name? -van croft. how is he? uh, i haven't seen him. gabe marine tonight told him to catch the peak down the street. -we're opening cold to the naves all over town. -im seeing it yet myself. morty did a great job. that's why i called you. hustle over and see it and take notes. -notes? are you kidding? -this is friday night. great kid audience. everything that sets them off, you make a note of it. do a scene just like it in the sequel. aren't you going to be there? you kidding? i got a weak stomach. morty is coming here later. we look over the sets, see what we can save. so hurry over and catch the show. and remember i want lots of notes. yeah. don't be afraid my dear. there's no need to be afraid of me no one would dare to harm you while i am here. i shall protect you always -...the smell of death. -yes i bring you life eternal life. one kiss and you shall join me to live forever. and for eternity. sit down pups. mr von croft... oh... why are you sitting here in the dark? this is where i belong. in the dark alone. oh come on now. come on it's not that bad. did you see the picture tonight? -yes. -then you know it is that bad. now look what you need is a drink, see? -i brought a bottle. - no thanks. i wan't have. well... it helps me. helps me. do you mind? the reason i came over here and see ya, i want to explain. ive been sitting here ever since i came home. trying to think of an explanation. forget about it that's my advice. they did it deliberately, why? why? your friend the director. was so convincing said he needed all those close-ups of me. and you agreed. i didn't know what he was gonna do with him i swear i didn't. and all the while he was planning this this, mockery coming in somebody else's voice, to make me look like a fool. well i had nothing to do with this so help me. -how could he do such a thing to me? -oh now look don't take it so hard, see? there'll be other chances other pictures. not after what morty lenten has done to me. i went to the theater expecting to see my comeback. instead i found myself attending my own funeral. that's right my friend drink a toast, a toast to ernst, ernst von croft, the greatest laughing stock of them all. may he rest in peace. -what do you got there. -souvenirs. souvenirs of the dead. look, remember these? -i wore this in my first picture, the voice of death. -sure sure. i remember these the wrappings when i played the mummy. oh it's great, it was the greatest. i saw it when i was a kid. yes and you didn't laugh at me then, did you? no, no nobody laughed at you then. you are a monster. you're the monster. now im dead, murdered by a stupid fool named morty lenton. no you're not you're not dead monsters never die. i believe in you von croft, you you'll show you... hal, morty... hal... what the hell...? help me...von croft... i tried to stop him. he knocked me down. i hit my head. -wher,e where is he? -i don't know. -but you've got to find him. -i know. -is he...? -death. that's how he killed morty. i don't understand this vampire bite. what was he trying to prove? something we should have remembered all along. he was... the greatest monster of them all. obviously the lesson of that story is quite clear. one should be careful what friends you hang around with. as in this business. these girls are very carefully screened. the one here for example the one lighting my pipe. she and i do not hit it off. she won't be here long. see you in a moment. until next week good night"

oh, the stockbroker's name is ogden. go on. well, it seems that ogden and his wife are ski freaks and this being the end of the season, they planned an extra long weekend-- someplace in vermont. oh, but the snow didn't show so they're heading back tomorrow. that's why we have to go today. the $100,000 in negotiable securities are part of a deal to be transacted at ogden's home on monday. rather than come back into the office to pick up the balance, he stashed them in his private safe over the weekend. that's kind of careless. he doesn't think so. he's been doing it for years. up until now, no one even knew the safe was there, not even ogden's wife. what about your source? well, um, she was his mistress and mistresses know everything. they have to, it's how they survive. yeah. right. well, speaking about survival, split's 50/50, right? wrong. all i want is the jewelry. you can keep the rest. i don't get it. well, um, the jewelry belonged to my sister. she was ogden's ex. mistress. right. he stole it from her and beat it right back to his wife. that jewelry represents five years of very boring conversations with a very boring stockbroker, and she wants it back. yeah. well, that suits me, lady. you can have it all. i mean, uh, she can have it all. never touch the stuff myself, there's too many problems. it's too hot, it's hard to sell, it can be traced. all i want's the securities. they're as good as cash. good. then we've got a deal. now, here's where the house is. it's on staten island. staten island? lady, i was told the job was in new york. well, it is. staten island is a borough of new york. oh, new york has five boroughs-- manhattan, brooklyn, bronx, queens, and staten island. yeah. well, thanks for the geography lesson. but to be real honest about it, uh, it doesn't make me feel any less nervous. i don't like this at all. hey, you can't back out now. i'm depending on you. i need you. lady, i'm your friendly burglar, i ain't your brother. please refrain from this i need you stuff. you want out, is that it? huh? come on, out with it. why, huh, because i'm a woman? huh? come on. the truth now, sam, or whatever your name is. out with it. ok. you finished? because if you are, let me explain a basic principle upon which i operate my life, and that is that greed always takes precedence over growl. and what does that mean? what it means is that i never allow my personal feelings-- be they anger, annoyance, or your garden variety ticked off-ness at a partner in crime, be it male or female-- to interfere with my earning my daily bread. so if you think that i-- well, then why do you want out? lady, i never said i wanted out. i said i was ready for manhattan island, not staten island. manhattan, staten. what's the difference? you're cracking a safe, not a city. the difference, lady, is i always like to case the joint. i'm a pro. i'm am not one of your central park punks. either we check out the hit or i'm bussing it back to buffalo tout suit. oh, is that all you want? yeah. that's all i want-- for now. well, there's no problem because that's already been done. now, here's ogden's house. we don't stand a chance. now what's the problem? well, the problem is the house is in the open. it's too much in the open. i mean, there isn't a nosy neighbor on the whole street that wouldn't spot two strangers coming in and going out. and they'd call the cops and i don't like it. well, then why did you take the job? i've you trying to tell me you i took the job because i thought it was in manhattan where there's plenty of noise, plenty of people, you won't be heard, and you won't be seen. and even if we tripped a dozen alarms, it takes the cops half a day to respond. so it's a little more risky. but just think of all that loot sitting there just waiting. i'm thinking. believe me, it's the only reason i'm not halfway back to buffalo by now. who are these people and how come they're running? oh, they're college students. they're probably late for class. oh, yeah? where's the college? it's about a block from the house. sam: oh, yeah? that's perfect. that's absolutely perfect. count me in. so, what do you think, how do i look? joe college? maybe joe preppy. so? so on the way to your place, what we're going to do is we're going to pick up one of these here schoolbags. my place? yeah. you're next. oh, you've got to be kidding. i mean, i would look stupid dressed like a preppy. wrong. you'll look just like everybody else, and that's the point. you want to blend in, you don't want to be noticed. ok. as soon as we finish the job, what we want to do is get away from the house as fast as possible, right? right. ok. car's too risky. it's a quiet street, somebody might notice the car. so the fastest way is to run. run, are you feeble? now, that's suspicious. oh, yeah? what bank they rob? oh. yeah, let's go to my place. i think it's going to work. you're a perfect little cohort. perfect little dodo is more like it. must we do this? now i know why i've been having that nightmare-- it's this job. oh, so it's back to me again. no, no, no. it's not back to you, it's back to anyone. look, i usually work alone. i make my own plans. i have never been caught and the only time that i've ever come close is where i worked with a partner. and what does that mean? it means that from now on, i'm running things. i am the boss. i say what we wear and when we go. i'm doing this for your own good, lady. i'm not a lady and the name is kara. i'm doing this for your own good, kara. you're repeating. i'm repeating because ladies' jails are no fun. women's jails are no fun. now you're repeating. you're right. and even though you're very silly, you're also very cute. what's my first order, mr. sam crawford? your first daughter is you never mention your partner's name. forget names, especially if we're caught. what's the difference? we're bound to have some identification. who says we're bound to have some identification? no one. i guess we don't have to carry wallets. now you're learning. no wallets, no purses, no identification. i get it. i get it. no wallets, no purses, no identification, no et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. right. let's go crack a safe. [bells ringing] i figure we time the job so we exit the house about five minutes before the start of a new class. and dressed like college kids, we had for campus and we're running just like everybody else around here. come on. 4:15. that means we've got to be finished and out of the house by 4:10. ok. when we get to campus, we enter at williams hall at the north entrance. this is it. i think it goes like this. cute. it's a [inaudible] safe. it's going to take some finessing. well, can you do it? it's a little late to ask that question, lady, but the answer is yes. can i help? yeah. as a matter of fact, you can. you can go out to the front room and you keep your eye on the road and if you see anything, and i mean anything suspicious, you come and you tell me tout suit because it's-- i know, ladies jails are no fun. now you're learning. there's a man out front, the gardener. he's-- [engine starting] he's mowing the lawn. [hammering] [drilling] come on, baby. go through. go through. come on. come on. [hammering] [engine starting] i think he heard. he heard, but he's not sure what and i don't think he cares. negotiables, lots of 'em. uh-uh. uh-uh. the jewelry's not part of the deal. remember, it belongs to my-- your sister. she can have it all. we've got to go. we've got about three minutes before class starts. [bells ringing] we've got about two more minutes before classes start. we've got to get out of here. get out of here. don't you know smoking's bad for your health? would you please just get in your truck and go? now. come on. slow down. slow down, slow down. slow down. let's try to act normal. we're a couple of college students, we're on our way to the ferry. [sirens] over here, window shop. do you suppose we were seen coming out? what if we tripped a hidden alarm or something? shouldn't we run or something? no. in manhattan, we could have run. people do it all the time. we could have ducked into a subway, we could have gotten lost in a crowd. it's too much in the open here. we'd be spotted and pinned in a second. no running. it's too suspicious. i'm scared. it's natural. it's natural. just keep looking in the window. please, lady, don't cry. it's an ambulance. ok. ok. i got you, 10-4. a policeman. be cool. he's following us. maybe he's just walking in the same direction we are. we're never going to make it to the ferry. you're kidding. can you make it to the cafe across the street? kara: i can try. sam: come on. let's stop. maybe we should go and ask him for directions. you know, i once saw this movie where-- don't be dumb. waiter: what'll you have? coffee and a piece of pie. oh, i'll have the same thing. thank you. here he comes. you stay calm. if he comes up to us and stops, what you do is you throw the coffee in his face and then we run. pete, i'm just going to use the phone. sure. oh, god. is he's calling to help? - he's use his radio. - are you sure? i mean, what if-- shh. marie, where you been? you know my tour was over half an hour ago. i've been up and down grand street half a dozen times looking for you. no. no no, no, no, no, no, no, i'm not complaining. i'm merely pointing out the-- of course i still want to see you. you know how i feel. i'm at pete's cafe on grand street. 10 minutes? no, of course i don't mind. yeah. i'll be right out in front. all right. all right. i'll see you in 10 minutes, ok? all right. bye. will that be all? sam: yeah. waiter: that's $5.40. all right. uh-- you got any money? no. remember, no wallets, no purses, no et cetera, et cetera. mm-hm. two deadbeats. this is the third time this month. you college kids are nothing but crooks. no. here, look. you take my watch. that watch won't get me a nickel. no one wants a watch nowadays, especially me. cash or i call that cop. well, i'll send you a check with interest. i'm no bank. i don't loan money and i don't want interest. randy, come here, will you, please. these college student bums owe me $5.40 and they won't pay. is that true? i just forgot my wallet, that's all it is. please. we'll-- we'll be back tomorrow. - yeah. there you go, pete. they'll bring you your money tomorrow. i want the money now or i want them arrested. i've been beat three times by these wise guy college kids. arrested? pete, you know what that means? that's two hours of paperwork down at the station house. it ain't worth it for a lousy $5 and change. oh. i'll tell you what i'll do. you, uh, you look like an honest guy. i'll take care of this myself. all right? i've got a date in a couple of minutes and i don't want to be late. ok. here. here. you meet me here tomorrow the same time and pay me back. all right? right. thanks, officer. just a minute. i'll take that bag. for, uh, security, you understand? you give me back by $5 tomorrow, i'll give you back your books. right? - right. randy? hey, sweetheart. don't forget now. tomorrow you're going to be here with my money, right? sure. will we? that's a good question. [theme music playing]"
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"- three in three weeks. - we're going to run out of ships. - that's not funny. - it wasn't meant to be. unless starfleet starts doing something about the dominion threat, the situation's going to get worse. what do you want, a war? what i want is to talk about something else. chief, what about kirayoshi? is he walking yet? no. not yet. odo, you're going to bajor next week. do you plan to see dr mora? actually, i've cancelled my trip. there's been a 75% jump in the theft of medical supplies and food rations on ds9. i haven't seen such an increase since... since? since just before the cardassians were forced to abandon the station. on that note, i think i'll turn in. me, too. - thank you for dinner, captain. - it was my pleasure. sir. goodnight, everyone. mr worf, you've been paroled. the party's over. thank you, sir. goodnight. i'll clean the rest up later. i want to be alone for a while. - ok. - goodnight, sir. 'ops to captain sisko. we just received a message from bajor, sir. 'kai winn is coming to the station tomorrow and she'd like to meet you.' acknowledged. thanks for the invitation, jake. that was a lot of fun. did you see how down my dad was? he was depressed. he's not the only one. there's something in the air. people are scared. he usually lifts everyone's spirits. people go to him for encouragement. where does he go when he needs it? i hope i'll be seeing you tomorrow at 1200 hours. why? haven't you heard? there's going to be an auction of some of the galaxy's rarest and most valuable antiquities. here. find something you like and make a bid with all that latinum you've got stashed under your bed. oh, nog. you don't really keep it under your bed? - no, of course not. - where did you get this stuff, quark? i'm just conducting the auction for a modest commission. the items were aboard a freighter that the bajorans found adrift about a light year from here. the cargo hold was crammed with valuable items of every description: antiques, paintings, vehicles. it's all a bunch of junk. listen to some of this stuff. a mid-24th century, ceramic romulan water basin, slightly cracked. a pair of tellarite shoes, date unknown. a mid-20th century human baseball card, a tholian... a baseball card? a mint condition 1951 willie mays rookie card! - nog, this is it! - what do you mean? it's perfect. this is how i can cheer up my dad. you know how much he loves baseball. he'll go nuts. tell him to be here at 1200 hours and he can bid with everyone else. no. i'm going to bid on this. i want to do something for him for a change. and this is it. all i have to do is get him this card. how hard can that be? come on, nog. why not? it's my money. if you want to bid, use your own money. i'm human. i don't have any money. it's not my fault you abandoned currency based economics in favour of a philosophy of self-enhancement. there's nothing wrong with our philosophy. we work to better ourselves. - what does that mean exactly? - it means... it means we don't need money. if you don't need money, then you certainly don't need mine. how much latinum do you have? - how much? - five bars. it's taken me a lifetime to save that money. i'm not going to throw it away for some baseball card. not even for my father, the man who made it possible for you to enter starfleet academy. oh, no. that's not fair. who believed in you when no one else would. this is so low. i can't believe you'd rather keep your filthy money under a bed than use it to give him endless moments of happiness. argh! all right, all right! i'll do it. that's very generous of you, nog. now let's get that money. humans. come in. - welcome back to ds9, your eminence. - thank you, emissary. you may go now, child. thank you. - why don't we take a walk? - a walk? would you mind? something wrong, eminence? nothing wrong, but there was a shop down there. a woman who sold bajoran tapestries and antiques. - kandra vilk. - yes. she moved to a neutral world near the coridan system two months ago. so many people have left deep space 9 in the last few months. there must be times when you feel you're being abandoned here. forgive me, eminence, but i have a very busy day ahead of me. i'm here to meet a representative of the dominion. - to what end? - i don't know. this meeting is being held at their request. you disapprove? i'm concerned. the dominion is notorious for its political intrigue. i have some experience in that area, as well. this is a delicate moment for bajor. the conflict between the federation and the dominion could escalate into open warfare. a misstep now could result in the destruction of our world. for once, i am in complete agreement with you. i will do whatever it takes to safeguard bajor. walk with the prophets. the bid is to you, sir. one bar, three strips. don't let the lady steal this fine example of post-eventualistic bronze and triptin sculpture for such a pittance. one bar, three strips. one bar, four strips and it's all yours. an honourable addition to any klingon household. the proceeds from the auction go to the bajoran war orphans fund. minus a modest commission. think of those poor, lonely children and how much your latinum will mean to them. they'll have to make do with one bar, three strips. sold to the blue man in the good shoes. lot 48. an andorian chest containing a pre-surak vulcan bracelet, a sixth century bajoran mandala, a 23rd century ion transtator, a willie mays baseball card from earth, dated 1951. who'll start the bidding with one bar of latinum? - one bar. - do i hear one bar, five strips? one bar, five strips. do i hear one bar, ten? don't worry. he'll drop out at two bars. - how do you know that? - i'm still a ferengi. - one bar, ten. - one, 15? one, 15. one, 20? one, 20. one, 25? - two bars. - the bid is two bars. do i hear two bars, five? vedek, are you in? - i told you. - two bars, five. three bars. - four bars. - jake! ten bars. the bid is ten bars of gold-pressed latinum. - is there another bid? - what do we do now? nothing. we're out of money. jake, do you want to make another bid? sold to the gentleman sitting in the aisle. lot 49. a rare example of a 20th-century human art form: acrylic on black velvet. this image was the inspiration for the flag of the martian colony... i know you wanted that card, but we lost it, ok? let's come up with something else to cheer up your dad. - like a new pair of shoes. - shoes? - what's wrong with shoes? - nothing, except it's stupid. i want to give my dad something that will bring a little joy into his life. that baseball card is the answer. it's kismet. - ""kiss you""? - kismet. fate. destiny. i was meant to give that card to my father. i think you're taking this baseball card thing way too seriously. it's not the card. it's my dad. this is very important to me. my father's never let me down. he's always been there for me and right now he needs me. i don't want to let him down. nog, please. let's get that card. all right. what do you want to do? sir... excuse me, sir. could we talk to you for a minute? - who sent you? - we wish to discuss a transaction. - not interested. - we want to buy the baseball card. i haven't done anything wrong and i won't be hounded by your soulless minions of orthodoxy. i haven't broken any laws, except perhaps the laws of nature, so stay away from me. habitat ring. captain sisko! i can't tell you how happy i am to see you again. i wish i could say the same. how delightful! you feel comfortable enough to make jokes. i'm pleased to see our relationship evolving beyond the adversarial stage. no, it's not. before you twist that into a compliment, let me be blunt. i don't like the dominion and i don't like you. let's dispense with the pleasantries and stick to business. i can't tell you how it pains me to hear you say that, captain. i really like deep space 9 and i like you. after this meeting with kai winn, we will be seeing a lot more of each other. - jake! jake! he wants to see us! - who? dr giger, the man who bought the baseball card. - he's willing to make a deal. - you're kidding. he left a message for us. it said to meet him at 1800 hours. that's in ten minutes. let's go. let me do the talking. you had your chance on the promenade. stand aside and let a professional handle this. step out of the doorway, please. don't touch anything. this is very sensitive equipment. i did some checking on you two. you are the station commander's son and you are the nephew of the man who owns the bar. since you are not working for the soulless minions of orthodoxy that have hounded my work, i have decided to open negotiations regarding the sale of a 1951 willie mays rookie card, without the chewing gum. we would like to open the negotiations with... - the card is not for sale. - but you just said... i'm willing to trade the card in exchange for the following items. two litres of anaerobic metabolites suspended in a hydrosaline solution. where are we supposed to get all this stuff? surely the commander's son and a cadet have access to a variety of equipment not available to someone like myself. it's a very long list. it'll take some doing. what are you planning to do with these things? we can't deliver equipment and supplies to you without knowing what you're going to do with them. very well, young man. let me ask you both a simple question. do you want to die? - no. - so why should you? why should any of us end up as putrefying corpses stuck in the ground? or vaporised into subatomic particles and vented into the cosmos? no reason that i can think of. i have devoted my life to the study of death. do you know what i found? death is nothing more than the result of cellular boredom. - boredom? - think about it. the cells in your body have been doing the same job every day since you were conceived. metabolise, divide... wouldn't you get bored? at some point, the cells say, ""that's it."" and you, the unwary victim of cellular ennui, are quite literally bored to death. i never thought about it that way. dr bathkin of andros iii was the first to solve the puzzle of death. keep the cells energised by teaching them new mitochondrial tricks. before he could finish his work, dr bathkin died in a shuttle accident. or so they say. while the soulless minions of orthodoxy refuse to follow up on his research, i could hear the clarion call of destiny ringing in my ears. and now, after 15 years of tireless effort, after being hounded out of the halls of the scientific establishment, after begging and scrounging for materials across half the galaxy, i have nearly completed work... on this: the cellular regeneration and entertainment chamber. - what does it do? - i'm glad you asked. it is specially designed to transmit biogenic energy on a chromo-electric wavelength and send uplifting and entertaining messages to the nuclei of every cell in your body. spend eight hours a day in this machine and your cells will never get bored. you will never grow old. and most important... you will never die. that is the goal of my work: nothing less than immortality itself. - excuse us for a moment. - of course. what do you think? i'm no expert in cellular chemistry, but his theory sounds odd to me. he had me going there. a cellular entertainment machine? - he's crazy, isn't he? - but he has the baseball card. - so we've got to help him. - i'm not sure this is a good idea. - nog, i can't let my father down. - let him down? your father doesn't even know this card exists. - i don't know which of you is crazier. - i'm not crazy. - i'm just a little obsessed. - a little? ok, doctor. we're in. do you how many germs are transmitted by a handshake? just nod if we have a deal. him, too. we need a neodynium power cell from a cardassian phase-coil inverter. that's an unusual piece of equipment. - we have to trade it for... - it's a secret. there's an old cell, but i don't have time to scrounge around for it. what's wrong with you? tell him you're trying to give your father a gift. no! i want it to be a surprise. if i tell the chief, he tells keiko... but you're not giving him any reason to help us. let me show you a little something about incentive-based economics. may i ask you a question? wouldn't you rather be doing something else? - almost anything. - isn't there something specific? - like going to the holosuites? - sure. i bet you'd rather be kayaking. you probably haven't shot those rapids in weeks. no interruptions, no maintenance schedules. just you and the river. that's what i'd be doing if dekker hadn't gotten sick. but i have to recalibrate these eps regulators so they don't interfere with the station's gravity grid. what if someone else recalibrated them? someone like us? - you'd do that for me? - absolutely! go shoot those rapids. thanks a lot. i owe you one. our pleasure. and, chief, about that power cell? i think i know where there's one. - i'll have it sent up to your quarters. - thanks, chief. come on. you calibrate, i'll scan. five litres of anaerobic metabolites suspended in a hydrosaline solution? - what could you want with that? - we can't tell you. - it's a surprise for someone. - they're not going to drink it? - i don't know. is he? - i don't have time for this. can i ask you one question? wouldn't you rather be doing something else? no? this is the first chance i've had to get any research done in five months. what jake is trying to say is that you seem unhappy. i have been feeling a little down now you come to mention it. if you had to name one thing that would make you happy, what would it be? - i don't know. - humour me. anything at all. kukalaka. that's what i want. leeta borrowed him. said he was cute, but she never brought him back. kuka-what? kukalaka. bring him to me and you'll earn yourselves five litres of anaerobic metabolites suspended in hydrosaline solution. done! just one thing, doctor. what's a kukalaka? weyoun has made a startling proposal. the dominion wishes to sign a non-aggression treaty with bajor. they're trying to split bajor from the federation. forgive me, emissary, but you've already done that. it was your advice six months ago that kept bajor out of the federation. how did you put it? ""bajor must stand alone"". we are very much alone now. you're not a member of the federation, but starfleet will protect your world. we're not going to stand by and watch the dominion conquer bajor. can you promise you will not let one jem'hadar soldier set foot on bajor? can you promise that you will use your entire fleet to protect our planet even if it means sacrificing other worlds like vulcan or andor or berengaria, or perhaps even earth itself? i can't make that kind of promise. i wouldn't believe you if you did. you see my predicament? if we ally ourselves with the federation against the dominion, we risk becoming the first casualty of the next war. if you ally yourselves with the dominion, you risk becoming the next conquered world. a most unhappy choice. i have asked the prophets to guide me, but they have not answered my prayers. i even consulted the orb of wisdom before coming here and it has told me nothing. so i come to you, emissary. you have heard the voice of the prophets. you were sent here to guide us through troubled times. tell me what to do and i will do it. how can i save bajor? you want my advice? then this is it: stall. tell weyoun you have to consult with the council of ministers. anything you want. but you have to stall for time. - time? for what? - i don't know. but i do know the moment of crisis isn't here yet. until that moment arrives, we have to keep bajor's options open. i'm aware that this is difficult for you, given our past. but this time you have to trust me. very well, emissary. we put ourselves in your hands. may we all walk with the prophets. refreshed, regenerated, mildly entertained. i still get bored after the first five hours. i've got half the things you wanted. good. where's the hydrosaline solution? we should have it soon. nog just got the bear. don't ask. do you know what that is? it's the sound of immortality. what's going on down there? turn that down! - nog! i'm working out here! - so am i! i have to filter out the sub-harmonic distortions in worf's opera recordings. i'm trying to add a little humour to kira's speech to the agricultural delegation. i have to listen at precisely 82 decibels, the volume worf listens at. if i could have told him why i needed two metres of electro-plasma conduit, he probably would have given it to me and things would be quieter! we can't tell anybody, nog! listen to this for a second. ""thank you for that kind introduction and for inviting me to address you. ""i've always thought it odd that water reclamation ""was usually treated as such a dry subject”. - is that funny? - no. i didn't think so, either. - watch it with that thing. - try staying out of the way! he's probably sleeping in his cellular entertainment thing again. it's not locked. there is no record of a dr giger being assigned to those quarters. he was there, odo. maybe the ""soulless minions of orthodoxy"" finally caught up with him. they were after dr giger's regeneration and entertainment chamber. his what? it's a device that keeps the cells in your body from getting bored. he was going to transmit messages to people's cells so they wouldn't die off. as a result, these people would... live forever. do you really think he's going to charge us with obstructing justice, being public nuisances? i can't have that on my record. he was just trying to scare us. nog, look. - it's kai winn. - see who she's talking to? the vedek who was bidding against us at the auction. i don't know what you're thinking, but i'm sure i'm not going to like it. he was bidding on that lot because there was a bajoran mandala in there. he must have been working for the kai. when they lost, the kai must have gotten angry. we all know she's dangerous when she's angry. you're saying to get the mandala she kidnapped giger? it all makes sense now. jake, i'm really starting to worry about you. - come on. - where are we going? a new human expression for you: we're going to beard the lion in its den. lions, gigers, bears... oh, my. i hope you've found our talks as rewarding as i have. do you plan on giving the first minister a positive recommendation regarding the non-aggression pact? i cannot reveal my recommendations to the first minister. - you understand. - of course. forgive me for asking. it is enough to know that you and i have found so many common interests. i feel that we are very much alike. no, we are nothing alike. nothing at all. - what is it, my children? - we need to talk. you accused the kai of burglary and kidnapping? - we didn't accuse her of anything. - you just implied it? - exactly. - are you trying to be funny, cadet? - no, sir. - i want an explanation now. it all began in my uncle quark's bar... we were in the bar and i guess we got a little drunk. it won't do any good to lie about it. captain, i would like to separate... as you were, cadet. drunk. my faith in the two of you has sadly been misplaced. you both are confined to quarters until further notice. dismissed! - what did you say that for? - i didn't want to tell him about the card. then he might be grateful for all the effort we've gone through. we certainly don't want that. habitat ring. once we get the card, everything will be fine. as your friend, i should tell you you're starting to go over the edge. you need to get away, clear your head. this isn't what i had in mind. do you think i'm a fool? let's start at the beginning. what is the nature of your relationship with dr elias giger? we barely know him. he had a baseball card that i wanted to give to my father. my father's the station commander. i know who your father is. go on. we wanted the card, so we agreed to get him a few things for his research. we got all the equipment, but he disappeared about three hours ago. you expect me to believe that everything you've been doing has been perfectly innocent? it was a coincidence that dr giger has been experimenting with polaric particles directly below my quarters? there's also an explanation to the meetings you've been having with virtually the entire senior staff of ds9? or that kai winn met with you immediately after leaving me? i suggest you stop playing games with me and tell me the truth... quickly. this is a misunderstanding. we're certainly not involved in some secret plot against... you betrayed me, turned me over to these soulless minions of orthodoxy. they won't discover the secret of my work without a... fight. so... there are secrets after all. there shouldn't be any secrets between friends, jake. - i do want to be your friend. - do something. all right. - we'll tell you the truth. - i'm listening. we weren't supposed to divulge this, but since you left us no choice... - we work for starfleet intelligence. - oh, no. forget about it, nog. we have to tell him. we're investigating the man in the picture. until yesterday, that man, one willie mays, did not exist in any historical documents. then, in the blink of an eye, that card appeared on the station and a bust of willie mays appeared at the hall of fame in new york. there's only one explanation. we suspect that this man is from the future. - a time traveller? - that's right. so far, that card is the only link we have to him. we must find out what he's planning to do in the past or what he may have done already. we need that card. the entire future of the galaxy may depend on us tracking down willie mays and stopping him. - i believe you. - you do? yes. that is, i believe your first story. that you're two innocent boys trying to give a gift to captain sisko. - you are very wise. - which still leaves the question: what you were doing beneath my quarters. he's just working on a way to become immortal. really? i have a background in creative genetics. i'd be most interested in hearing your theories. it may take some time to explain. let me ask you a simple question. - do you want to die? - excuse me. - can we go? - of course. thank you. aren't you forgetting something? 'captain's log, stardate 509294. ""two days ago, this station felt like a tomb. 'i'd never seen so many of my crew depressed at the same time. 'but it now seems as though a new spirit has swept through the station, 'as if someone had let a gust of fresh air blow through a musty old house. 'why this is happening is a mystery to me. nothing has really changed. ""the dominion and the cardassians are still a threat 'and i can still see the clouds of war gathering. 'so why do i sense a new-found sense of optimism in the air? 'maybe the real explanation is as simple as something my father taught me. 'even in the darkest moments, 'you can always find something that will make you smile.'"
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"come in. seven of nine's shipwide efficiency analysis. did we get a passing grade? barely. she wants to present it to the senior staff. put her on the schedule. we'll be passing by a class- t cluster in the next couple of days- -  gas giants, radiogenic sources. l'm not sure it's worth altering course. at the very least, we should send the delta flyer for a look, and let's get a full range of sensor scans as we get closer. we'll go to a level- 3 analysis of the cluster. tom, get the flyer ready and assemble an away team. harry, start continuous scans. kim to seven of nine. proceed, ensign. any chance you can increase radiogenic resolution in the long- range sensors? the captain wants to get a cleaner look at that cluster coming up off starboard. acknowledged. take these specifications to lieutenant torres. right away. deck 1 1. what's our borg queen want now? we need to route at least another five terawatts to the sensor array. deck 15. hello. sorry to interrupt. l'm about to disprove schlezholt's theory of multiple big bangs. of course, l had to demolish wang's second postulate to do it. power transfer requisition. you're standing in the way of cosmological history. the cosmos is 16 billion years old. lt can wait another few minutes. schlezholt would thank you for the reprieve. captain's log, stardate 537 53.2. long- range scans of the t- cluster have indicated a number of tantalizing anomalies. the away team should have a field day. who knows? l may even join them myself. billy... mm... billy, wake up. what do you want? l need help. good night. billy, don't you dare go back to sleep. what's the problem? l'm in trouble. go to sleep. help me first. with what? this level- 3 sensor analysis. l've got four hours of subspace infrared to interpret. long- range scans on that cluster up ahead? yes. lt's too complicated to do over the com. either we meet in the mess hall, or we wait until tomorrow. l don't want to get dressed, and it can't wait until tomorrow. your only options. l've given operations an efficiency rating of 7 6 out of a possible 100. not exactly flying colors. the crewmen you assign to the night shift are frequently left with little to do once the ship's course has been locked in. the devil finds work for idle hands. religious metaphors are irrelevant. perhaps you should consider assigning them additional tasks. what's this l'm guilty of: ''failure to utilize expertise''? crewman mortimer harren. he has five advanced degrees in theoretical cosmology, but you've assigned him to the... plasma relay room. his talents could be put to better use. b'elanna? believe me, l've tried. when l give him more responsibility, he doesn't do the work. harren wants to be down on deck 15. lt gives him more time to repostulate the origins of the universe. as you can see, security is functioning at near- perfect efficiency. however, commander, if you arrange the phasers in the weapons lockers so that the smaller rifles were in front, they could be more easily removed in the event of an emergency. l'll look into it. crewman william telfer. billy. he certainly ruined my score. he visits the sick bay almost once a week complaining of illness. lnvariably, you examine him and find nothing wrong. mr. telfer is a hypochondriac. l'd treat him for it, but he's afraid of medication. have you tried counseling? he's afraid of that, too. all l can do is scan him and offer him reassurance. wasting your time and medical resources. what about astrometrics? looks like you could use some improvement yourself, seven. you're correct, unfortunately. tal celes, sensor analyst, grade- 3. her work must be constantly double- checked. she should be removed from astrometrics and reassigned elsewhere- - perhaps to engineering. forget it. l've got my own problems to fix, remember? that'll be all, seven. thank you. dismissed. captain? they've never been on an away mission. mortimer harren... william telfer, tal celes- -  none of them. they get off the ship whenever we have general leave. l mean a working away mission. harren never volunteers, celes can't get past the proficiency requirements, and telfer always seems to get a note from his doctor. something's got to be done about this. what can we do? there are always a few who don't make it past their first year on a starship. normally, they're reassigned. but in our case, maybe we should relieve them of duty and let them pursue their own interests. lt certainly wouldn't hurt general efficiency. they aren't drones, chakotay. we can't just deactivate them. ls the delta flyer ready? flight- checked with provisions for a 72- hour away mission. what have you got in mind, captain? three people have slipped through the cracks on my ship. that makes it my problem. the analytical aspects of the subspace infrared algorithm are fourfold. unfortunately, l have a threefold brain. you just have to break it down. think of it as four smaller algorithms. okay. but what's the sequence? lt's... zero- g ls fun. as you were. zeta particle derivation. gamma wave frequency. lon distribution. flow rate of positrons. z.g.l.f.- - zero- g ls fun. that's how you remember the sequence. thank you, captain. - l'll try. - good... because where we're headed, you're going to need it. l'll be briefing you this afternoon in astrometrics. we'll leave first thing in the morning. deck 15. captain on the deck! at ease. junction room 16? over there, captain. of course. crewman mitchell, how have you been? uh, never better, ma'am. yourself? not bad. not bad at all. uh, to the left, ma'am. thank you. crewman harren. captain janeway... are you lost? l was, for a minute. l'll be briefing you this afternoon. well, there's been a mistake. excuse me? you have me assigned to an away mission. l have my duties here. l'd prefer not to leave my post. ensign culhane will cover for you. the preflight schedule is all there. lf this is charity, captain, l don't want it. l didn't ask you what you want. l'm taking the delta flyer on an astronomical survey mission, and your expertise is needed. what do you know about my expertise? as much as l need to. well, then you might be interested to know that l'm about to disprove schlezholt's theory of multiple big bangs. really? wang's second postulate has more lives than a cat, doesn't it? once you think you've eliminated it, bam, it pops up again. l'll give you a hand, if you'd like, when the away mission is over. once we reach the cluster, we'll drop out of warp and maintain one- quarter impulse on the sweep through the protostars. l'll be piloting the delta flyer. celes, you're going to run an ongoing sensor analysis, providing data for your colleagues. mr. harren, you'll be looking at subspace particle decay for anything new we might learn about star formation. and, mr. telfer, your job will be to look for signs of life, a long shot in this environment. but if it's out there, l'm sure you'll find it. you'll have the rest of the evening to familiarize yourselves with the mission. excuse me, captain. lf we find a planet, we're not planning on exploring the surface, are we? that's a stellar nursery. any planets will be gas giants. they may have moons. don't worry. we'll run a complete scan for pathogens before we set foot anywhere, and the delta flyer is fully equipped to deal with medical emergencies. we'll be fine. shuttle bay 1, 0600 hours. dismissed. celes is unreliable. her sensor analyses will be full of errors. you could be putting your lives at risk. don't worry, seven, l'll check her work. this mission could be better served with a more experienced crew. no... not this mission. ever hear the tale of the good shepherd? lf even one sheep strayed into the wilderness, the shepherd left the safety of the flock and went after it. so, you're intending to rescue them? ln a manner of speaking. maybe all it will take will be some personal attention from their captain, maybe something more, but l won't abandon a member of this crew, no matter what their problems might be. poor guy... rotting away down on deck 15, counting the years till we get out of this godforsaken quadrant. lt's a shame he doesn't have a superior officer who cares. lt's not my job to make everybody who works for me happy. some people just don't want to fit in. l'll bet you haven't said two words to him. two words, exactly. we collided in the corridor during a borg attack. l said, ''excuse me.'' since we were at red alert and about to be destroyed, l think it was very considerate of me. well, mr. considerate, why don't you go over there right now and offer him some encouragement? his first away mission. l'm sure he could use it. brushing up on the delta flyer specs? l'm not a mechanic. oh. then, what are you doing? very interesting. what do you find most interesting about it? your creative use of the minus sign. l see you have a, uh, appreciation for multivariate analysis. maybe you missed your calling. lt's a shame. l imagine it gets tedious up at the helm. l enjoy the view. well? l invited him over to watch our television set tonight. you don't mind, do you? celes, celes... respond. celes, respond. you're not sick. yes, l am. no, you're not. really... l am. we have to sleep. l can't go on this mission. yes, you can. no, l can't. - yes. - no. bye. wait. see? lt's nothing. lt's a fever. your temperature is .2 degrees above normal. that's right. a typical deviation easily prompted by emotional stress. or a multiphasic prion. you have not been infected by a prion. they attach themselves to the mitochondrial walls, and they just... l've already scanned you. you can barely see them. they aren't there. lf they migrate to my cell membranes while l'm on the away mission, they could rupture and l... crewman, l am not giving you a medical excuse... not this time. try to get some sleep. you shouldn't even have a medical tricorder. believe me... you'll be so caught up in the excitement of exploration, there won't be any time for worrying about infections, mitochondrial or otherwise. there's nothing like an away mission to remind a person of why we're out here. l'm going to one- quarter impulse. should l start the sensor sweeps? we don't want to miss anything. engine status? within parameters. that wasn't us. anything on sensors? .005 fluctuation in the spatial continuum. lt looks like simple background noise. l agree. anybody for lunch? are you volunteering, william? yes, ma'am. l'll help. what would you like, captain? mortimer? even my mother didn't call me that. well, then, mr. harren, are you hungry? no. thank you. l'll have the pasta soup. lt should be listed under neelix 651. maybe l'll try that, too. l'm sure you'll like it. l'm sure l will. thanks for the suggestion. l'd better get back there. neelix 651, two servings. neelix 651, two servings. what's wrong? the captain checks every single thing l do. oh... that's just standard procedure. then, why isn't it standard procedure for you or harren? maybe she's giving you special attention. yeah, because she knows l need it. l wish l could go back to voyager. me, too. there's always the escape pods. can you imagine? l understand you grew up on vico v. no wonder you became a cosmologist. wildest sky in the alpha quadrant. so they say. l've never been there. do you really believe that childhood environment is more important than genetically driven behavior patterns? just making conversation. conversation filled with unspoken assumptions, which l don't agree with. l'm a product of my nucleic acids. where and how l was raised are beside the point, so if you're trying to understand me better, questions about my home planet are irrelevant. all right, then. how's your 13th chromosome? missing a couple of base pairs in gene 178? l signed onto voyager because l needed a year of hands- on experience. lt was a requirement for getting into the lnstitute of cosmology on orion l. lf we hadn't gotten lost in the delta quadrant, l'd be there right now. sorry to have delayed your career plans, but all of us have had our lives interrupted. that's the nature of space exploration. lt's unpredictable. which is why l don't like space exploration. stumbling from star to star like a- a drunken insect careening toward a light source is not my idea of a dignified existence. pure theory is all that concerns me. well, l'm not trying to change that. l'm simply trying to get every member of my crew working to their full capacity. that includes you, mr. harren. you don't feel responsible, captain... for having three misfits aboard your ship? well, if there's anything l can do to help relieve your guilt... please let me know. l'll keep that in mind. maybe l will join my colleagues for lunch. all this exploration has given me an appetite. computer, identify the source of that spatial fluctuation. source unknown. red alert! aft section, report! report! captain, are you all right? we need to get propulsion back on line and figure out what hit us. what's out there? l don't know, but whatever it was, it tore a plating section off the outer hull. 90 percent of our antimatter's been neutralized. the reaction's cold. so much for warp drive. l'm bringing the impulse engines on line, but they've been damaged. we'll be able to do one- eighth impulse, no more. that should get us to the rendezvous point with voyager in about ten years. think they'll wait for us? ls the subspace transmitter on line? voyager, this is the delta flyer. we've been hit by an unknown phenomenon and taken heavy damage. we require immediate assistance. repeat: we require immediate assistance. transmit that continuously on all subspace frequencies. anything on active scans? not yet. lt was a dark- matter protocomet. l read a paper on that phenomenon once. written by me. well, enlighten us, mr. harren. l hypothesized that a tertiary product of stellar consolidation would be a comet- like assemblage of dark matter. lt would be attracted to any source of antimatter and neutralize it upon contact. so, one of these things detected the antimatter in our warp core? the term ''detected'' suggests a consciousness. this is a mindless astrophysical phenomenon, nothing more. we should eject our remaining antimatter or we could suffer another impact. l can't do that, not on the basis of an unproven hypothesis. the forces involved are nontrivial- -  if we're hit again, we could lose our entire outer hull. eject the warp core, and we lose any hope of getting warp drive back. l need more evidence, and right now, sensors aren't talking. maybe they are talking, but somebody doesn't know how to listen to them. you're out of line, crewman. this isn't the time to be worried about her feelings, captain. we're in trouble. captain, that hull plate- - it's less than ten kilometers away. lmpact from a dark- matter body might've left a quantum signature in the alloys. that's the evidence we're looking for. do we have transporters? yes, l've locked on to the plate. beam it directly to the aft section. celes, you're with me. continue the repairs. no sign of burns... or plasma residue. lt seems to have been sheared off. download this into the main computer. captain, l'm sorry. for what? l thought that spatial fluctuation we ran into was background noise. some noise. l saw the same sensor readings you did and came to the same conclusion. you don't have to doubt yourself all the time. yes, l do, and you should, too. you're right to always be looking over my shoulder. we all make mistakes, even me. every day? every time you report for duty? on voyager, it doesn't matter, because nothing l do is that critical. seven doesn't trust me with anything important. the crew is protected from my mistakes by the people around me, but... out here l could get us killed. you went through starfleet training courses. l had to cram for every exam. at the academy, l was infamous for my all- nighters. every night? because that's what it took. that's the only way l made it through. not to mention the sympathy votes. the conflict on bajor worked in my favor. the federation was so eager to have bajorans in starfleet that my instructors gave me the benefit of the doubt. so did you, when you accepted my application. you showed evidence of unconventional thinking. l liked that. not everybody would've thought to retrieve that hull plating. well, just don't trust me with the analysis. l guarantee l'll get it wrong. well, with that attitude, l'm sure you will. this has nothing to do with attitude, captain. you and l are wired differently. to you, this is nothing but data. to me, it... it's a monster with- with fangs and claws. ln my nightmares, l am chased by algorithms. my brain just wasn't built to understand this. we can find you another post on voyager. there isn't another post on voyager, not for me... unless you need a waitress in the mess hall. you know... there's more to duty than the ability to manipulate algorithms. everybody on voyager has showed a courage far beyond what l could've expected. so have you. lf we were still in the alpha quadrant, would that be enough to keep me on board? l can't answer that. l don't deserve to be on your ship, captain. and l'm not really a part of voyager. l just live there. pressure's increasing. the eps relays are fused. cut the plasma flow. cut the plasma...! l could've been killed. what's wrong with you? everything. lf you want something to fantasize about, try imagining how it'll feel if our hull is breached and we die of vacuum exposure. our blood will vaporize, and our cell membranes will rupture. surely you know the symptoms better than l do. let's not talk about it, all right? nothing disagrees with me more than having to put theories into practical use, but there's no choice, so pay attention to what we're doing here. you can check yourself into sick bay when we get back. and you can go back to deck 15. that's right... where l don't have to rely on you or your intellectually deficient friend. at least l have a friend. don't you ever get lonely down there? ln the company of my own thoughts? never. l don't believe that. spend some time with us when we get back. you might enjoy yourself. a hypothesis that would require testing. l'm a theoretician, remember? captain's log, delta flyer, stardate 537 64.3. we've been running on minimal power for six hours. still no response to our distress call, and no answers from the computer on what hit us. for now, it looks like we're on our own. our scans of the hull fragment were inconclusive. we found some displaced positrons that could indicate a dark- matter impact. but could've been caused by something else? proof enough. not enough for me. not enough to jettison the remaining antimatter. there's a gas giant only a few hours from our current position. t- class, surrounded by orbital rings, including one that's radiogenic. we could use those particles to reinitialize our warp reaction. with ten percent of our antimatter left, we'd only be able to make warp 2, but it would be enough to get us back on the road. set a course. another spatial fluctuation. can you localize it? lt's somewhere within the distance of 10,000 kilometers. another one, closer, about 7,000 kilometers. lt's being drawn toward our antimatter. eject the core. open a channel. all hailing frequencies. this is captain janeway of the federation vessel delta flyer. we are on a mission of peaceful exploration. please identify yourself. no response. of course not. lt's a natural phenomenon. captain, we only have a few seconds. l'm firing a photon torpedo. there's enough antimatter in the detonation chamber to draw that protocomet, if that's what it is. the torpedo's away. distance: 1,000 kilometers. 1,500. no spatial disruptions. find the source of that sound. oh, no. that's not possible. where is he? l can't locate his bio- signature. he's not out there. he's not in space, not in subspace. lt doesn't make sense. lnside... me... activate the transporter. try to get a lock on whatever's inside him. tricorder isn't picking up anything. but l can feel it. l- l can't get a lock. lt's like something's there, but it's not there. oh, it's there. unfortunately, l have to agree. obviously, whatever hit us was no protocomet. l was wrong. maybe you weren't, not entirely. sensors can't scan it; transporters can't lock on to it. maybe this is some kind of dark- matter life- form. that's impossible. molecules that complex would collapse under their own weight. they could never support life. might be time to revise your theory. where did they take you? l don't know. lt was dark. god, l could feel breathing all around me. did anyone try to communicate with you? l couldn't see. l tried to say something, but there wasn't enough air. l tried to move, but something was pressing down on me. the hypospray- - tetrovaline. lt'll put me out. lf l sedate you, it could lower your immune response, and you need to stay conscious. do you understand? billy... if it wanted to kill you, it would've done it by now. lt never would've sent you back here. maybe it was trying to scan you or something. lf it wanted to get to know me better... it should've just asked me out for a drink. celes. keep an eye on him. harren. l'm setting a course for those rings. shunt as much power as you can to the impulse engines. we never should've left voyager. l've got news for you, crewman. voyager isn't exactly a safe haven. we've been chased across the quadrant by far worse than whatever's out there- - the vidiians, species 8472, the borg- - but l guess if somebody's hiding down on deck 15, they may not be aware of it. l wasn't meant to be an explorer. and l wasn't meant to guide a ship across an unknown quadrant. then we're both victims of circumstance. oh, l've seen things l've never imagined, grown closer to people than l ever thought possible. l wouldn't call myself a victim, and l wouldn't trade the last six years for anything. then you've been deluded by the inexhaustible human capacity to avoid the truth. you're the one hiding, not me. l've got you three more percentage points of impulse. l'll take it. setting a course. lsn't there any part of you that feels a bond with the rest of us? when we escape from the borg or discover a new type of star, don't you feel some pride of accomplishment? when you're in the mess hall, alone at your table in the corner, don't you see the friendships around you and wish even for a microsecond you were part of them? you don't know me at all. no, but l'd like to. that was the whole point of this mission. but l guess it hasn't worked out like l planned. lncoming transmission. source? lt's a starfleet frequency. must be voyager. ...the delta flyer. ...phenomenon... ...hit by an... ...heavy damage. repeat: require, require immediate... immediate, immediate... flyer, flyer, flyer, flyer... subspace echo. maybe not. there's a .005 deviation in the carrier wave. that's the same degree of spatial fluctuation left by our pursuers. they're sending our distress signal back to us. modified. they might be trying to communicate. ...delta flyer, flyer, flyer. ...hit by an unknown phenomenon, unknown. they're taunting us. not necessarily. try to adjust the universal translator for... captain! he went right through the force field. billy, what are you doing? lt's activating my motor neurons. l can't make it stop. l'm sorry, captain. you've got to stop it. no. lt's okay, billy, it's okay. lt's okay. lt's in here. lt's tapping into our systems. wait. lt may be trying to communicate. lt's into our environmental controls. we've got to stop it. hold your fire! what the hell is wrong with you? lt was trying to kill us. - you don't know that. - we were at risk. l gave you a direct order. what if you were wrong? l could hear its thoughts. explain. when it left me... l could hear what it was thinking. ''do not belong.'' that's what it said: ''do not belong.'' we don't belong here. or it didn't belong in the delta flyer. maybe that's why it was tapping into the environmental controls. lt was trying to survive in a place it didn't belong. that's speculation. based on direct observation. you murdered an alien being and destroyed any chance we had to make first contact. we just lost another section of hull. how far are we from the gas giant? 200,000 kilometers. l'm taking the flyer into the radiogenic ring. with any luck, they won't follow. we can't survive in there for more than a few minutes. that should be enough to reinitialize the warp core. start continuous transport of radiogenic particles directly into the reaction chamber. when it's approaching critical mass, let me know. watch for any sign of pursuit. how are you doing? l always had this alarm in my head, sort of an internal red alert. lt was like a warning system that would tell me l was sick or dying... of something. mitochondrial prions, food poisoning, a head cold. lt was always there. and now it's not? lt's gone. l don't understand. maybe l do. when l was a girl, l was afraid of the ocean. l liked to swim, but, uh, in a pool or a pond, where l knew exactly what was beneath me. but in the open water, with no way to know what was down there... it scared me to death. lt wasn't until my first year at the academy, after l went through zero- g training in the coral sea... that l finally got over it. l think you just came up from your first deep dive. they're in pursuit. three minutes, 20 seconds to intercept. we'll need twice that to reinitialize warp reaction. get into the escape pods. captain. plot a course away from the planet. l'm going to fire a phaser volley and hopefully set off a chain reaction of the radiogenic particles. lt might be enough to disable our friends. you'll be disabled, too. not if l go to full thrusters and keep in front of the shock wave. lf l don't make it, head for the l- class moon in the next system. you could survive there for weeks if you have to- - enough time for voyager to pick up your distress signal. now get moving. no. you'll have a better chance if we're with you. go. we might not have contributed much on voyager, but what we do here matters. we're the crew here, and the crew does not abandon its captain. all right, it's your choice. then l'll be going alone. good luck. charge phaser banks. stand by to divert all power to thrusters. escape pod 1 is occupied and ready, captain. launch pod 1. escape pod away. how close are our pursuers? 65 seconds to intercept. stand by to fire. captain, the escape pod is altering course. lt's heading for the aliens. janeway to harren. what are you doing? lf they have to deal with me, it should give you a few more seconds to get away. that's my theory, anyway. resume your escape course now. lt's too late for that. you made a mistake, harren. don't make another one. l'm done hiding, captain. a few seconds of exposure to real life... maybe l'll understand what l've been missing. he closed the channel. get a transporter lock on that pod. l- l can't. we're out of range. more power to the thrusters. celes. we're still not close enough. thrusters at maximum. got him. fire. shock wave approaching. contact in four... three... two... one. more or less. my crew... easy. they're sleeping. no serious injuries. everyone's all right... though you gave us a good scare for a while. we received your distress call. we found the flyer drifting above a gas giant. you were all unconscious. any sign of... another vessel or some kind of entity? no. what happened? the good shepherd went after some lost sheep and ran into a wolf. did she find them?"

[door slamming shut] mary! ma-- [music playing] mr. mourns? - mearns, actually. - my name is king. do you think i could have a word with you? colin: i'm just going out-- it was about the ad. ad? oh, you-- you seen the ad? oh, oh, please come in! thank you very much. right. well, um, uh. oh, please, come upstairs. sorry. please, make yourself at home. what can i do for you, mister, um. king. colin: king. yeah. funny. i must have messed you up with somebody else. sorry. it's just i've got into the habit of putting names to faces. now, how can i help you? well, i saw the ad, you know, the one about the memory course. and it said on that that you were a mne-- oh. a mnemonist. king: yeah, i was just going to say that. it stems from the greek, you know. mnemonic, an aid to memory recall. yeah, of course, yeah. colin: do you want a monroe? possibly, yes. just-- - just having a little celebration with my secretary. it's her birthday, you know. oh, that's nice. colin: would you care to-- to glance at our brochure? um, the full course is four weeks. oh. you do a bit of fishing, do you? yes, very fond of it-- was that your secretary i saw? yes, she just popped out. have you got a receptionist? no. staff problems. it's been difficult, you know? all on your own, then, eh? i'm afraid so, yeah. that's good. thank you. [king groaning] now. i have forgotten something. ah? and i thought that you, being a-- a mnemonist. mnemonist, might be able to help me to recall it. that's what our course is designed for! no, no, i don't want the course. i just want you to help me to remember one particular thing. i don't think you quite understand my methods, you see. i help to develop people's memories through these techniques of association. now look, i don't want a lot of stupid sales talk on fancy words. i mean, i've come here to buy something, and if you don't sell it, then i've come to the wrong shop, haven't i? well, let's-- let's not be too hasty! i haven't got time for a four-week course, but i'm quite willing to pay for it in cash. and if you can help me to remember this one particular thing, then i'd be very happy to double it. that seems more-- more than fair, i must say. i, i-- well, my-- my fee for the full course is 100 pounds. 100? that includes stationery and coffee. king: fine. - the receipt. - no. we don't want anything on paper, do we? ah. [inaudible] well now, mr. king. king, yeah. what exactly can i do for you? well, two days ago, i put some, um, personal belongings in one of the luggage lockers at the station. now, these are new lockers, they've got no keys. but what you have got is a row of buttons with numbers on them. now, you punch four figures, and then you get a ticket with the number of the locker and the figures that you've punched, right? sort of a combination. then when you go back, you punch the numbers again, and the locker opens. ah. i bet it was made in japan, eh? [chuckling] well, what exactly is the problem? well, you see, i memorized the numbers in case i lost the ticket, 'cause the stuff is very important. and then i lost the ticket, and now i can't-- you can't remember the number. i can't remember the number of the locker, or the combination. it's seven figures. well. couldn't you-- i mean, i don't want to forfeit my fee, but couldn't you just go back to the station, explain what's happened-- - oh no, no. there's a problem there, 'cause they-- they'd require some identification, and at the moment, i can't lay my hands on my documents, you see. and they'd want to know what was in the bag. they'd probably open the bag. and there is some very personal things in there. very private things. it's not drugs, is it? drugs? now, that is not a very nice suggestion. and i might add that you took the money a bit quick to seem to me like a man who's fussy. we've all have to earn a living, you know. then you better show me how you earn yours. now, i know you don't want a full course, but we've got to start something. now, it was sigmund freud who first drew our attention to the possibility that memory lapses may be rooted in the unconscious mind. and the way to unlock that mind is through association, assimilation, and correlation. perhaps you would like to jot down those three headings while i think up a few shortcuts. [music playing] eh, what? finished? no, got the last one. colin: charlie krebs, a safe breaker. sought by police after the theft of 160,000 pounds from the safe of mayfair's [inaudible] casino. a police spokesman said the notes will be difficult to trace, as they came from the night's takings. krebs was released on parole from a 10-year sentence. darling, i think i've had real break at last. a struck of absolutely disreputable luck! what time is it? well, it's 7:35. [mary gasps] all through putting a name to a face. now, the faceless most untrustworthy, and the name ridiculous. krebs. krebs? yes! you don't remember him, do you? but i do. and i think he's going to be the most rewarding pupil i have ever had! colin, i'm sorry, but i must go. oh look, this could make all the difference in two or three days! darling, i'm sorry, but i'm going to be late. the table's booked for 7:30! that archie-- wait, this is important! now, there's some wine in the fridge if you want to, but i must go. take care of yourself. bye! bye. thus, as kepinski has shown, we may deliberately suppress a memory because it is disagreeable. because it has connections with some guilt, or shame, which may have its origins in infantile experience. in other words, we don't want to remember! what are you talking about? of course i want to remember! i said i didn't want the course, all i want to do is remember seven bloody numbers! yes, well as i was about to say, perhaps we should put aside theory for the moment, and move on to a more practical approach. all right, then. [music playing] shall we try again? now, think, mr. king. please think. when i tap a number, you call out yes or no, right? - yeah. - nine. no. - two? - no. colin: four? no. colin: six. no. there must be a yes someone on this board, mr. king. please, please, try to find the yes. oh god, i'm going to go bananas! i'm going to forget me own name in a minute. i-- i have tried every technique i know. except, of course. what except, what? well, no, i haven't done it for a long time, i wouldn't-- you haven't done what? hypnosis. you mean hypnosis? yes, but frankly, i'm not very keen on it, because i may have gone rusty. listen, can you do it or can't you? 'cause if you can't, i'm going to find somebody who can, 'cause i want results! they're going to open the locker in two days' time! all right, we could try. we could try hypnosis. well come on, then. let's try. i can't just do it like that! i've got to refresh my memory! i've got to look at my notes and everything. well, tomorrow morning, then? yes. 9 o'clock? nine. right. listen. 9 o'clock sharp. yes, sharp. [music playing] [clock ticking] [groans] god. [music playing] subject will not remember anything he has said under hypnosis, unless he has been instructed to remember. unless he has been instructed to remember. [phone rings] you're bright and early. i did say 9 o'clock sharp, didn't i? colin: now, are we nice and relaxed? well, you know. breathe deeply, all right? that's it. that's good. - ok? - right. now, we're going to think of nice gentle things like clouds and streams-- keep watching the pen. and fields and trees. and now, we're floating down a big wide river, and i'm gonna lie in a boat that's rocking gently to and fro. that's nice. and now, we're got to start counting backwards from 100. now, 100. 100. colin: 99. 99. 98. yes. king: 97. tiring. king: 96. 95. 94. 93. [music playing] [mumbling] mr. king. [king snoring] mr. king? charlie krebs? not guilty. charlie. charlie. when you nicked all that cash from the casino. it was 162,000, wasn't it? well, give or take a pound, yeah. and look-- you were on the run, weren't you? the police were after you. oh yeah, the police. they nearly got me, you know? yes. so you put the cash in that locker. yes. and you threw away the ticket because you knew that if they found the ticket on you, they'd get the loot, right? i tore the ticket out and stuffed it down the drain. i thought i'd remember the number! oh, thought you'd remember the number, yes. well, i do! you do? you do-- you do, charlie? yeah! what is the number, charlie? 154. 154. [groaning] would you repeat that, charlie? 154. and the combination number? 6237. number of the locker was 154, the combination was 6237. yes, now, look. one thing. yes, charlie, one thing. one-- when you wake up, you will remember nothing. i will remember nothing. especially numbers. especially numbers. now, wake up, charlie. charlie? [phone rings] char-- charlie, wake up! [whimpering] hello? mary (on phone): colin? mary! colin, love. i-- i couldn't go without saying, well, you know. i've got news for you. you knew-- you know that thing that i was talking about? well, it's come off! well, as near as a cat's whisker, anyway. look-- look-- so you can forget all about tweed skirts and jumpers. you're not going anywhere near freezing aberdeen. you can go anywhere you like in the world, with me! look, i can charter a yacht! i can go big game fishing! whatever you like! what-- look-- what about the bahamas, eh? [inaudible] what happened? yes. now, the estimated population of the bahamas in 1947-- what are you talking-- was 194,000. the principal-- colin, have you gone mad? so this is just to confirm your appointment for this evening. thank you very much. i went clean out! yes, i know you did, yes. did i say anything? look, unfortunately, nothing we could use. what-- what do you mean? it didn't work? no, i'm afraid-- yes, i'm sorry. look, i must be a great disappointment to you, but i've got an urgent appointment. all i can do is to return your fee, and-- i don't want the money! mr. mearns, i want to find the numbers! listen, what-- did nothing-- yes, [inaudible]. you may be a little confused for a while. if so, make yourself a cup of tea and lie down for an hour. listen, i don't want a cup of tea. what are you doing, mister? [music playing] [interposing voices] mr. mearns, please try it again! i've gotta remember! [bell dings] woman (on intercom): passengers for swain, [inaudible],, and hendon should take the rear three coaches on platform two. krebs (voiceover): number of the locker was 154, combination was 623. [bell dings] woman (on intercom): the 10:45 first train to london will depart from platform seven. platform seven for the 10:45 to london. platform seven for the 10:45 to london. [music playing] hello? hello, would you put me through to archie goodchild, please? hello, archie? yes, it's mary. yes. yes, i've packed, but-- archie, i've changed my mind. mr. king? mr. king? [grunts] [music playing] i'm sorry, archie. really, i am. i think i'm just too fond of colin to leave him. [whimpers] yes. yes, i-- i know it's silly of me, but-- but there it is. please forgive me. [dial tone] bye. [whooshing] [phone rings] [explosion booming] [sirens blaring] [rubble clattering] must have set it off accidentally. what you think, there's a half a pound of explosive in that bag. won't keep you long, miss. just a couple of questions. i don't understand why he wanted to leave luggage in a station locker. he didn't. he collected it. was this man krebs his pupil? yes. he seemed to be in a state about krebs. i'm not surprised. he'd remembered something about him. colin never forgot a name or a face. i'm afraid he forgot one name, miss. a nickname. krebs is the best safe-blower in the business. they call him gunpowder charlie.

- once this picture's over, they won't be able to hold me here with chains. i figure another month, it'll be all over. - oh, but that's so long. couldn't i come out to you, please? i could leave tomorrow. - darling, you're wonderful, you really are. nothing would make me happier. but suppose he follows you. i mean, the last thing i need now is any kind of scandal, you know that. no, sweetheart, there's too much at stake. i mean, i wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. darling, i wanna make you so proud of me. - i'm proud of you now. and, larry, larry, look, all those ridiculous things i said in that last letter, you know i didn't mean a word of it. i mean, you must know that. i'd be the last person in the world who'd want to spoil your chances. - then let's go ahead as we planned. sweetheart, when this picture is over and i can write my own ticket, we're gonna be sitting on top of the world. janice?

- good manners. look, for your edification, this is not the way to win friends and influence casting agents. - all i want is a chance, i'm a good actor. right now, i need a job, it's as simple as that. - i'll make it simpler. go home, you're not right for the part. - why not? - you read the description. it calls for nobility, breeding, a kind of english aristocracy. - so? - you're greenwich village, the drifter type. it shows all over you. - so? i'll fall on my face, so what, it's my face. - mr. duke, this is a very busy office. - i'll bet you've never even looked at my face. - i see it! (buzzing) - i bet you think there's nothing behind it, don't you? well, lady, you're wrong. there's dreams and feelings behind it the size of mountains. - [mimi] mrs. brandt. mr. roberts says, would you send in the next actor, please. - all right. - come on, when was the last time you were desperate for something? - believe me, you're not what they're looking for. - then let them tell me, please. - janice, what's holding you up? cal has a plane to catch. - i'm glad to see you, mr. roberts. - i know, harold, i'm sorry. - i'm larry duke. - wait, wait a second. here, i (speaker cut off). he doesn't have a chance. - all right, young man, now you've gone over the-- - duke, larry duke. - yes, larry duke. this is the part of the englishman. - right, you want this in dialect? - well, just read it, mr. duke. - well, mr. roberts, england is a big place. this could be anywhere in england. i mean, it could be-- - just read it, mr. duke. - ah, milicent, i knew i'd find you here in the garden. bit under the weather tonight, aren't you? - mr. duke, we don't have time for method rehearsals. - this is not a rehearsal set. - would you kindly read the script! - i've already started the scene, sir. - you have? - yes. - well i can't hear you. - bit under the weather tonight, aren't you? well, old darling, i'll bet the whiskers-- - just a minute, who are you mad at? what are you shouting for? this is a light, gay, airy englishman. this is a comedy. - right, right. - i'll bet the whiskers on your butler's chin it's because of your father's goot. faithful arnold will cheer-- - gout. - should i make it funnier? - [harold] gout, mr. duke, gout. - right. gout. it's because of your father's gout. faithful arnold will cheer you up. shall i make a funny face?

(bright instrumental music) aw, janice. - sorry. harold, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. next, i tried to keep him out. - [harold] next actor, please. (bright instrumental music) - [janice] taxi! taxi! - remember me? - very well indeed. - look, i'd like to apologize for my bad behavior up there. i guess i'm something of a nut. - well, please, forget it. i really have to-- - no, look, really, i'm sorry. i'd like to make it up to you. look, how about something warm for a cold shoulder? - no, thank you, mr. duke. - you remember my name? score one for me. you sure you won't join me? - i'm sorry, i can't. - you were right. they clobbered me in that meeting. look, i really do apologize. - accepted. now, if you'll excuse me, i'm trying to get a cab. - [larry] why the rush? - first, i make it a rule never to drink with budding actors, and, secondly, my husband's waiting. - in chicago? remember, i was there when he called. look, i don't mean to embarrass you. it's just that you're the first casting agent i've been able to talk to for more than five minutes since i got to new york. this can be an awful cold town for a guy just starting out. i guess i just wanted somebody to know i'm alive. please, won't you join me for a drink? - i'm sorry, i'd like to help. there's a cab, taxi! oh! - you all right? - i'm fine, i can manage. please, if you just hold that cab. - even i'm a better actor than that mrs. brandt. - [janice] what are you doing? - i'm being suave, debonair, and bon vivant. how else am i supposed to learn? (romantic instrumental music) - remember, darling? you literally swept me off my feet. and, even then, i had no resistance. larry. can you hear me, larry? larry. larry. - i'm thinking, darling. (twisting instrumental music) i'm thinking. - about what? - us, what we mean to each other, what we've been through. janice, every moment we've had together has had a shadow lurking over it, spoiling it, making our love something dirty and cheap. - [janice] what are you talking about? - janice, do you love me? - oh, darling, how can you ask such a question? you know there's nothing in the world i wouldn't do for you. - [larry] then i'm going to ask you to make a decision. - what decision? i don't understand. - janice, don't you see? if we let him, he can destroy everything. you, me, the whole works. but tonight, we can stop him, free ourselves once and for all. that decision is yours. - what decision are you talking about? - the one we've been avoiding too long, concerning your dear husband. - what about him? - he's dead to the world you said, right? well, sweetheart, i think it's time we made him deader. (dramatic instrumental music) i think it's time we made him deader. janice? janice, did you hear what i said? - uh, i'm not sure. - janice, he's a curse on us. you gave me your word there'd be no trouble once you asked for a divorce, but he's still hanging on like a leech. janice, he's capable of smashing my life, my career, everything if we give him half a chance. well, he's not gonna smash me, janice. not now, no one is. i swear it. - larry, you sound so strange. - remember, once i told you i only play it one way, the only way i knew how. - uh, larry, i'm so confused. - [larry] i want you to remember the first time i said it and what you answered. - larry, he may wake up at any minute. - [larry] he's not gonna wake up, janice. now, listen to me, i want you to remember that first time i told you how i play this game of love and what it means to me. - i'll try. - try hard, baby. because once you do, it'll make the rest easier. remember, it was that same day i brought you home. (dramatic instrumental music) - this has gone far enough, put me down now. - wow. - i said you could put me down now. - oh, yeah, service with a smile, that's me. how's your ankle? - i'll manage, thank you. good bye. - good bye, good bye, she says. here i am soaked to the skin, she says good bye. most people wouldn't put garbage out on a day like this, let alone a sir galahad like me. the least you could do is let me dry off a minute. - i have been rather rude, haven't i? all right, you can stay a few minutes. i'll make some coffee. - oh, coffee, yeah, oh yeah, coffee, thank you. that'll hit the spot. - just make yourself comfortable. i won't be a moment. - hey, listen, are you all right? - i'm fine. - rugged individualist to the end, aren't you? - look, mr. duke, i invited you in for coffee, not instant analysis. if you wanna start the coffee, it's in the kitchen. - no, thank you, i'll wait for you. (soulful piano music) - tell me about yourself, mr. duke. - [larry] there's not much to tell. i wanted to be an actor ever since i was a kid. now i'm not a kid anymore, i still got the hunger. - [janice] what about your parents? - no parents. they were killed when i was five. auto crash. after that, it was one foster home after another. you'd be surprised what a kid can pick up about life playing that circuit. it gets to be like a revolving stage after a while. nothing seems real for very long. not even people. anyway, after i graduated that off-broadway scene, i bummed around in the navy for a couple of years. and here i am, ready for action. any more questions? - [janice] nope. - now it's my turn. how long you been married? - [janice] four years. - happy? - yes, very. - [larry] he's a lot older than you, isn't he? 15 years or so, wouldn't you say? - i'm sorry, i can't hear you. - skip it. your husband drinks, doesn't he? (dramatic instrumental music) i'm sorry, but there's always something around the eyes gives them away. - are you always so positive about things? - only when it comes to weaknesses of the flesh. - not that it's any of your business, but my husband is a very successful copy writer. maybe he did drink a little bit before we were married, but, i assure you, that's all over now. - bully for him. but let one little obstacle come along he can't handle, i bet he'll be back boozing it up before you can say gin on the rocks. - you don't have very much faith in people, do you? - living in foster homes didn't help much. people are masks to each other, especially in a marriage. most couples live out their whole lives without ever once exposing their true natures. - i suppose you think my marriage falls into that category. how wrong you are. - am i? then why are you twisting your wedding ring like it's burning a hole in your finger? - i think that's enough. - i don't think it's half enough. i don't think it's been enough for the last four years. - get out of my house. - [larry] you're not as invincible - i said get out of my house! - all my life, i've watched women like you, hurrying down fifth avenue, driving by in big limousines, treating me like i didn't exist. well, i do. and, for once, one of you is gonna know it. (dramatic instrumental music) my name is larry duke. i'm alive, i'm human, recognize me. i wanna belong somewhere, to someone. - this isn't happening. - let it be you. (dramatic instrumental music) i'm stopping now. if i kiss you once more, it stops being for fun, for kicks. it becomes the real thing, for keeps. i don't know any other way to play. - neither do i. - then walk away. one more kiss means we're two of a kind. and there's no turning back. - no turning back. (dramatic instrumental music) no turning back. no turning back. - [larry] no turning back. those words sealed us forever, janice, and anyone that stands between is our enemy, don't you see that? - yes, but what can i do about it? - you can make certain that we have the rest of our lives together without this barrier between us. - larry, don't. - [larry] he has to be taken care of, janice. when he's around, we don't have a chance of making it together. - don't say that! - it's true, janice. all of a sudden, it's crystal clear. with him around, we're dead. but with him dead, we're free and clear all the way. - larry, you sound so crazy. - [larry] me or him, janice, that's what it amounts to. tonight is showdown night, one way or another. - you mean, you mean you want me to, do you realize what you're asking? - [larry] easy now, just take it easy. don't put words in my mouth. - look, i'd do anything in the world for you, but, please, not that. - darling, i wish there was some other way, i really do. don't you see what it can mean? - but how can we? i mean, what could i do? - all right, all right, let me think about it a while. i'll figure out something. can you call me back in 15 minutes? - i didn't say i, i didn't say i'd do it, i didn't say that! - okay, okay, maybe your loyalty to him is too strong. we'll just forget the whole thing. and maybe while we're at it, we'll forget we ever met each other. good bye, janice. - larry! don't hang up! i'm so desperate. i swear i'll kill myself if you do. i'll kill myself. i can't live without you. (dramatic instrumental music) i don't know how i ever lived one day without you. - [operator] your call to mr. lockwood can be put through now. - yes, yes, mr. lockwood. - [mr. lockwood] janice, is that you? - hello, jack. i bet you're surprised to hear from me again. - it's a pleasant surprise. - look, i've got wonderful news for you. i think i found the perfect actor for judd in wild rebel. - [jack] but what about craig? - i know, i know you're about to sign craig hamilton, and he's with the agency, too, but both harold and myself feel you'll be making a great mistake if you don't test larry duke before signing anyone else. - [jack] larry duke? - that's right, that's his name, larry duke. take my word for it, jack. he's got more appeal than a dozen craig hamiltons. i tell you, he's sensational! he cannot miss. i mean, have you ever heard me go overboard for anyone like this? - [jack] well, if you're sure. - believe me, jack, jack, he's something special. - [jack] janice, hello? - yes. - [jack] are we still connected? - i'm still here. what was that, jack? - [jack] you want us to hold up craig's contract? - that's right. - his contract. - that's right. we want you to hold up craig hamilton's contract until you've tested larry duke. - [jack] well, you haven't been wrong yet. - wonderful. wonderful, jack, you won't be sorry. - [jack] i hope not. - i tell you, he's the type of man who could charm a woman into doing anything, anything at all. - [jack] you make him sound terrific. - yes. yes, i'll be waiting to hear. (dramatic instrumental music) - [larry] me or him, janice. who's it gonna be? - you. you. only you. - then call me back in 15 minutes. dial me direct this time, don't use the operator. i'll be waiting with all the details. - larry, i don't think i can. i don't think-- - [larry] janice, i'm depending on you. (dramatic instrumental music) now just answer this, did anybody see him come into your apartment? - [janice] no. - and his car, did he come by car? - i don't know, he's parked directly in front. i'm frightened, larry, i'm so frightened. - you and me, janice. the rest of our lives together, remember that. in 15 minutes, it can all be ours. - larry. - [larry] i'll be waiting. good bye, darling. (dramatic instrumental music) - ed, ed, wake up. ed, wake up and go home. why did you have to come here tonight? why couldn't you have given me a divorce when i asked for it? now look what's happened. what are we doing here like this? (trembling instrumental music) - janice, what is it? lately, well, i can't seem to reach you anymore. - can't we discuss it some other time? - no. we've always been truthful with each other. now what's going on? - maybe we've just grown too used to each other, too unexciting. that happens, you know. - what about our plans? i mean, i mean our plans to leave new york if my promotion goes through? - i couldn't possibly leave new york now, not now. it's out of the question. - i don't understand, you're like a stranger. something's come between us. - maybe just the truth of what a poor marriage we really have. - janice i (speaker cut off by phone ringing). - excuse me. yes? - lockwood studios. - lockwood studios? yes, put it through. it's hollywood, jack lockwood, the call i've been expecting. maybe you better go on to your club meeting. - [operator] i have your party, go ahead, please. - hello, hello, jack. - [jack] janice. - yes, it's janice again. say, you are an angel for calling me back so promptly. - [jack] it's my pleasure, i wish you were here. - what? yes, there's some fine points i'd like to clear up with you on the larry duke deal. well, you wait til you see him. he's irresistible. the kind of man that can make a woman do anything. anything. anything at all. (dramatic instrumental music) (phone rings) larry. - sweetheart, thanks for calling back. you dialed me this time, didn't you? - yeah. larry, larry, don't make me do this thing. - janice, darling, i wish there was some other way, but we just can't go on like this. i worry about you all the time, wondering if we'll ever have a life like other people. i tell you, i can;'t take it anymore. now listen to me, is he still out? - he hasn't moved. - [larry] good, now this is what i want you to do. only, you gotta move fast, before it starts getting late. - larry, i'm shaking all over. i feel sick. - baby, it'll be over before you know it. i thought of something so simple, it'll be like snuffing out a candle. janice, are you listening? - yes. - [larry] where are you? i mean, whereabouts in the apartment are you? - i'm sitting on my bed. - [larry] good, you must have a pillow there. - oh, yes. i have the pillow you sent me from hollywood, remember? - get the pillow, janice. i want you to go to him and press the pillow against his face for five minutes. - larry, no. - janice, when you called back, you sealed this bargain. i mean it, it's now or never. i swear to you, janice, if i hang up now, it's for the last time, i'm finished. - no, larry, no. i'll do it. i'll do it, only just don't hang up on me. - have you got the pillow? - yes. - [larry] get it done with. do it now. - larry. - put down the phone, baby, don't think about what you're doing. i'll be right here waiting, all the time. - [janice] and you'll never leave me again? - never. - larry, i'm so afraid. - [larry] for me, baby, for us. i love you. - i'll do it now. wait for me. (dramatic instrumental music) oh, darling, it's absolutely mad. i love it, and i adore you for thinking of me. - and you really like it? yeah, well, i think it's kind of gauche, and, of course, you'll never have any use for it. i spotted it the night i arrived, in a little shop on hollywood boulevard. soon as i saw it, i knew i had to send it to you for laughs. - look, i'm dying to hear about the screen test. how did it go? - you ready? they flipped, they really dig me. even i couldn't believe how good i came over. janice, they've already signed me to a contract. they want me to start on the picture immediately. did you ever hear of anything so fantastic? - oh, darling, i'm so happy for you. i knew it would happen. but you have to start to work so soon. won't they let you come back to new york? (women laughing) can you hear me, larry? - hi, again. - hi. hi. darling, am i interrupting something? - [larry] no, it's just some publicity people taking pictures. they're all gone now. what was i saying? - the screen test. - oh, yeah, yeah, the screen test. sweetheart, how i wish you could've been there. i gave you all the credit. - oh, oh, how sweet of you, darling. darling, i'm so excited for you. i just can't wait to see you. - [larry] janice. - it's mr. roberts, he's back. - thank you, mimi. darling, darling, i have to hang up. business, you know, as usual. will you call me tonight at the new number? - [larry] you bet i will, baby. i miss you. - oh, i miss you so much. you do a good job and come home to me. i love you. - [larry] i love you, baby. (bittersweet instrumental music) - didn't you even tell him what happened? - oh, i don't want to worry him. he's got more important things on his mind. - mrs. brandt, you've been a good friend to me. i'd like to help. would you like to talk about it? sometimes talking it out helps. if you want, i could meet you downstairs. - thank you, mimi, but there's nothing to talk about. - what made you do it? you knew that mr. roberts had his heart set on craig hamilton playing the part. the contracts were already drawn up. - i knew all about it. - wow, no wonder he fired you. what made you do such a thing? - it's what larry needed, he needed that part very badly. - brother, when you fall in love, you really fall in love. - is there any other way? - what are you gonna do now? i mean, losing your job and your reputation, your husband? is any man worth all that? - larry is. he's worth that and more. he'll make it up to me. you'll see. - sure he will, sure. everything will turn out fine. - it has to. thanks, mimi. - oh, wait. your gift. - oh. - you're forgetting your pillow. and don't worry about the rest of your things. i'll send them on to you when you're settled somewhere. - okay. good bye, mimi. - bye. - thank you.

(dramatic instrumental music) - larry. - [larry] janice, you all right? - larry, it's done. i killed him. he's dead. it was like putting him to sleep. - you're positive. - he's dead. he looks so small and quiet. talk to me. talk to me. say anything, please. - it's all right, baby, it's all right, it's over. the worst is over. - [janice] when are you coming home? - before you know it. - and you'll never leave me again? - darling, i told you i wouldn't. now, janice, you've got to listen to me. there's not much time. i want you to take a blanket off your bed and cover him with it, you hear me? - [janice] a blanket. - make sure the street is clear and no one sees you, leave the car door open, and drag him into it as quickly as possible. - i don't think i can. what if he's too-- - [larry] janice. i'm depending on you, janice. you've got to get him into that car. - and then afterwards, you'll come home, and we'll get married, and you'll be a great actor, and i'll have dinner waiting every night, and we'll drink wine and kiss each other all the time. tell me, please, tell me it's gonna be like that. - yes, of course, darling, it's gonna be just like that, right down to the last detail. haven't i told you that a thousand times? i'll come through for you, baby. only, right now, you've got to come through for me and finish what we've begun. after you get him into the car, drive down to the east river. see that the blanket's covering him. park on the dock near 22nd street, make sure it's deserted, and dump the body into the river. after that, take the car and leave it a few blocks from the house. wear gloves. walk back to the apartment, wait for my call. have you got all that, janice? janice? - i did it for you, larry. i did it for you. - [larry] i know that, baby. only, you've got to get him out of that apartment before it gets too late. - will you call me, darling? - in an hour. you should have it all finished by then. - [janice] do you hate me for what i did? - oh, my darling, my sweet baby, how can you even think such a thing? you're my girl. i'm with you all the way. - all the way, all the way. you call me, darling. - [larry] trust me, baby. i'll be thinking of you. - larry! - [larry] what, darling, what is it? - larry, i want to come out to you tonight. i want to be with you. i wanna take the first plane out. i can't be alone, not now! not now. i'll take the first plane out. i won't take no for an answer. i won't, i must, i must! i have to be with you. i must, larry! can you hear me? larry! larry! larry, do you hear me? - oh, yes, of course. you'll take the first plane out, you'll be with me tonight. - i love you, larry. - like i said, darling, all the way. only hurry. hurry. (smokey piano music) - [operator] operator. - los angeles police, please. - [man] sergeant beck speaking. - hello, sergeant, my name is larry duke. i'm calling because 10 minutes ago, i received a long distance call from new york, the wife of a very dear friend of mine. she was hysterical, rather incoherent, so i don't know if she was telling the truth. but, uh, she said she just killed her husband. she said she couldn't take his beatings anymore. at any rate, uh, she was gonna take his body and carry it to the car and dump it into the east river. she sounded half crazy. i think the new york police should be notified, don't you? - [beck] what's her name and address? - yes, a mrs. janice brandt. b-r-a-n-d-t. 877 east fourth street. i think you better hurry. i mean, you know, she sounded insane, so who knows what she'd do or say at this point. - [beck] we'll call immediately. - right, i'd appreciate that. could you call me as soon as you hear? - [beck] what's your number? - 2714699. - [beck] 2714699. - i'm terribly worried. - all right, mr. duke, we'll call her immediately. - right, sergeant, thank you. (snaky instrumental music) (bright instrumental music) - [woman] who was that on the phone, mr. duke? - just a friend, mrs. duke. - you were gone an awfully long time. - well, i had some business to take care of, some pre-honeymoon business. - did you get it done? - you know it. - that's what i like about you, darling. you're always so sure of yourself. you know exactly what you want, don't you? - like i told you, baby, we're two of a kind. brains, beauty, and ambition the size of the pacific. you and me are headed for the top. ain't nobody gonna stop us. - you have a nice touch. - yeah, don't i, though? (bright instrumental music) at first, all seemed blissful for larry, when, suddenly, there appeared on the horizon a cloud no bigger than a man's hand. actually, it wasn't a cloud at all. it was a man's hand, and it was on the end of what is known as the long arm of the law. darlene, a truly ambitious girl, couldn't resist the publicity inherent in breaking down in court and turning state's evidence. you see, she'd been listening to larry's conversation with janice. next week, we return with another story, scenes of which you shall see in a few moments.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"'i've come to marva iv, a planet near the badlands, 'to rendezvous with an informer claiming to know the whereabouts 'of the maquis leader and former starfleet officer, michael eddington.' looking for a friend of mine. his name is ""cing'ta"". cing'ta? throw it on the ground. turn around. - hello, captain. - eddington. mr cing'ta won't be joining us. his shuttle had an accident on the way here. is he dead? you just don't understand the maquis. we're not killers. mr cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a nasty planet in the badlands. - but i assure you he's very much alive. - how merciful. - you condemned him to a slow death. - it's more than he deserved. he was going to sell us out to you. he betrayed us. there's a subject you know a lot about. you've been on my tail for eight months and that's all you have to say to me? i will say the rest at your court-martial. tell me, captain. what is it that bothers you more - that i left starfleet to fight for a higher cause or that it happened on your watch? you didn't ""leave"" starfleet. if you had, i wouldn't be here. you betrayed starfleet. you used your security chief position to feed the maquis information about us. at the same time, you misled us with false information about them. there is a word for that - treason. look out there. those people were colonists on salva ii. they had farms, shops, homes and schools. then one day, the federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the cardassians. just like that. they made these people refugees overnight. it's not that simple and you know it. these people don't have to live like this. - we've offered them resettlement. - they don't want to be resettled. they want to go home to the lives they built. how would you feel if the federation gave your father's home to the cardassians? - i'm not here to debate... - i didn't tell you to turn around. look at them, captain. they're humans, just like you and me, and starfleet took everything away from them. remember that the next time you put on that uniform. there's a war and you're on the wrong side. you know what i see out there, mr eddington? i see victims, but not of cardassia or the federation, victims of you - the maquis. you sold these people on the dream that one day they could go back to those farms, schools and homes. but you know they never can. the longer you keep that hope alive, the longer they will suffer. go ahead, shoot me. someday, i may take you up on that. for now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. don't come after me. you'll regret it. sisko to defiant. eddington just beamed out. trace his transporter signal. 'got it. he's on a maquis raider. they're heading out of the system.' beam me aboard and lay in a pursuit course. all hands to battle stations. he's headed for the badlands. course is 0, mark 213. - commander? - changing course to 0, mark 213. - we're on his tail, captain. - maximum warp. - how long until we're in firing range? - 22 minutes. major? he'll reach the plasma fields two minutes before we're in range. we need help. what's starship malinche's position? patrolling in the dmz. perfect. is the new holocommunicator ready? the chief's had it on-line for six hours. - he's eager for someone to try it. - i always like to please the chief. open a channel to captain sanders on the malinche. - are you receiving my image, captain? - yes, and you? you appear to be sitting on my bridge. it may take me time to get used to this. i'm not fond of uninvited guests. i'll try not to overstay my welcome. we're in pursuit of a maquis raider headed for the badlands. - can you intercept? - you seem pretty eager, captain. - what did this maquis raider do? - it's who's in command. - michael eddington. - everyone's favourite traitor. - if you don't mind... - you want him in your brig. we'll cut him off. you can grab him. sanders out. the malinche is moving to intercept. prepare to target the maquis ship. i want them disabled, but alive. understood. send a security detachment to the transporter room... captain, eddington's dropped out of warp. go to impulse. raise shields. - what is he doing? - he's changed course. - he's headed directly for us. - he's locked weapons on us. he's no match for the defiant. is this a suicide run? not eddington. he's up to something. let's not give him a chance to make his move. mr worf, fire phasers. - report. - we've got a massive computer failure. every computer system is down. and all the backups. we're losing control over... everything. weapons, navigation, helm, propulsion... bridge to engine room. commander, get down there. find out what's going on. try to route the auxiliary controls through the... before you waste a lot of time trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. you can't. your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. these work remarkably well. glad we were able to procure one. you left a cascade virus in the defiant's computers. sounds simple, doesn't it? but i assure you, it took time devising one that wouldn't be detected by odo or o'brien. i'm quite proud of it. i'll add it to the list of charges against you. as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this? you know your problem? you've made this personal. it didn't have to be. it wasn't with me. i have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. - i wish i could say the same. - does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? and would starfleet approve? i don't need lectures from you. no matter what happens here today it's not over between us. i'm the one in control here, captain. your ship is defenceless. i could destroy you right now, but i won't. the maquis aren't killers. our quarrel is with the cardassians, not you. leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. cease fire. - am i supposed to thank you? - no. i'm not going to make you grovel for your life. unlike you, captain, i know when to walk away. maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. 'captain's log, stardate 50488.2. 'the defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. 'the starship malinche had to tow us home... we've got our work cut out. eddington's virus disabled every memory circuit on the defiant. we'll have to reprogram the entire database. how long? if we were at a shipyard with a crew... we're not. how long? two weeks. working with three shifts around the clock. get started. if you can speed things up... i'll do what i can. i removed two similar cascade viruses hidden on the station's main computer. by signal transmission, eddington could have disabled our defence system. how long until you've eliminated eddington's handiwork? i can't guarantee we found all of them. eddington was ds9's chief of starfleet security for 18 months. he had the opportunity to compromise every system on the station. - then check every station system. - i intend to. sir, have you reminded starfleet command that they stationed eddington here because they didn't trust me? - no. - please do. any word from intelligence? two bolian freighters have disappeared near the badlands. - they hold the maquis responsible. - what were they carrying? several thousand tons of selenium and rhodium nitrite. that's not very valuable cargo. what would they want with it? commander dax is analysing that. help chief o'brien get the defiant back on line. i want to get out there as soon as possible. - what can i do for you, captain? - i don't know how to tell you this. starfleet command has given me a new assignment. - they want me to bring in eddington. - they've ordered you to help? no. your mission orders have changed. eddington is not your responsibility. - did they give you a reason? - well... you've been after him for eight months. not to put too fine a point on it, but you haven't gotten the job done. captain, i understand how you feel. if one of my officers had fooled me the way eddington fooled you, i... i'd take it personally, too. bad choice of words. i didn't mean ""fooled"". no, you're exactly right. i was fooled. but it won't happen again. that's not the issue. starfleet believes that, where eddington is concerned, you're vulnerable. he just knows you too well, captain. maybe it's time for someone he doesn't know to go after him. - good hunting. - thank you, captain. intelligence is making progress breaking the maquis communication codes. the bad news is, it won't do us any good. we're out of the game. but what the hell! you win some, you lose some. you always had problems with the ""lose some"" part. in 25 years of duty i have never been taken off an assignment - until now! right. this is about being taken off the assignment. it has nothing to do with a certain ex-security officer we both know. he worked under me for a year and a half. i saw him almost every day. i read his reports and had him to dinner. i even took him to a baseball game in the holosuite. it's my job to be a good judge of character and what did i do? not only did i not see it, i put him up for a promotion. - he played his hand well. - he played me, all right. and what is my excuse? is he a changeling? no. is he a being with seven lifetimes of experience? no. is he a wormhole alien? no. he's just a man, like me... ...and he beat me! - it's good. - ""good""? it's good you're working it out on the bag, benjamin. because you're going to have to let go of this one. eddington is someone else's problem. you have to live with that. - 'ops to captain sisko.' - what is it, major? 'sir, you'd better get up here. there's news and it's about eddington."" - report. - eddington just upped the ante. he attacked the cardassian colony on veloz prime with a biogenic weapon. he launched three stratospheric torpedoes at the planet, spreading cobalt diselenide throughout the biosphere. it's a nerve agent harmless to most humanoids, but deadly to cardassians. cardassians are already evacuating. the maquis intend to reclaim the planet once they are gone. where did the maquis get materials to make a biogenic weapon? i should have seen it earlier. the selenium and the rhodium nitrites they hijacked can be reformulated and with some work, synthesised to produce cobalt diselenide. - where's the malinche? - on the other side of the badlands. - they're headed for veloz prime but... - eddington will be long gone. given the amount of chemicals eddington stole how many of these weapons will he be able to make? enough to poison every cardassian colony in the dmz. there must something we can do. worf, are there any other starships near veloz prime? the malinche is our only ship in the sector. so unless they stop eddington, the maquis have turned the tide. there is another ship in the area. it's moored at docking bay 3. defiant. it's going to be tricky. only half the systems are back on line. most are not operating at full capacity. - what about the warp drive? - we can go to warp six. the inertial dampers aren't fully repaired, so don't expect a smooth ride. the targeting scanners have to be manually calibrated. we can shoot but god knows what we'll hit. - and communications? - the com system is fried. we still have our com badges. they won't work either, not with all the interference from the unshielded eps conduits. what do we use? cups and a long string? we'll improvise. let me introduce you to your new com system... cadet? cadet nog, reporting as ordered, sir. stand easy. with most of the bridge control functions off line, all engineering orders will be relayed. for clarity, those messages will be relayed with one voice - mr academy here. you'll want somebody who can hear you while the bridge is exploding. - exploding? - we may be in a combat situation. - do you think you're ready, cadet? - yes, sir. absolutely, sir. i'm glad to hear it. report to the bridge. aye, sir. ""exploding""? let me give you all the bad news at once, sir. we have no cloak, no transporters, no replicators, and the stabilising gyros are only at 50%. so don't ask for any sharp turns - you'll end up doing barrel rolls. - that could be fun. - do you have any good news, chief? the new holocommunicator i installed works perfectly. let's be thankful for small favours. prepare for departure. - all right, say it. - what? that i'm turning this into a vendetta between me and eddington. that i am putting the ship, the crew and my entire career at risk, and if i had any brains i'd go to my office and read odo's crime reports. - i wasn't going to say that. - but that's what you were thinking? no. what i was thinking is... you're becoming more like curzon all the time. - i don't know how to take that. - consider it a compliment. and the next time i go off half-cocked on some wild-eyed adventure, think back to this moment and be a little more understanding. recalibrate phaser banks one and two. initialise starboard and port thrusters. ops has cleared us for departure. engine room, stand by impulse power. engine room, bridge, stand by impulse power. stand by to increase deuterium injection rate. configure driver coils for impulse speed. set eps taps at level 3. ops, seal the airlock and release docking clamps. close exterior hatches. depressurise the airlock. detach umbilicals, clear all moorings. - thrusters at station keeping. - initialise deflector field. - docking clamps released. - helm, ease us out. port and starboard thrusters at one-quarter. bearing 180, mark 0. distance from docking ring: 50 metres, 60, 70, 80. - bring us about, old man. - hard to port. ten degrees pitch. minimal power to aft thrusters. let the momentum bring us around. - hold at five degrees pitch. - we're coming around too fast. ease off on the port thrusters. pitch back to zero degrees. pulse starboard thrusters, point-five second bursts. engine room, helm control is sluggish. realign the navigational gyros. port thruster, two second burst. - helm, i hope you see that pylon. - bow thrusters, pitch up 16 degrees. full power to port thrusters. half roll... now. engine room, one-quarter impulse power. - one-quarter impulse power. - lay in a course for the badlands. stand by for warp speed. set intermix to point zero-one. initialise warp chamber on my mark. three, two, one. mark. warp one, sir. increase speed to warp six as soon as possible. sir, engine room reports we could go to warp seven. well done. mr worf, i think we should start running battle drills. aye, sir. 'captain's log, supplemental. 'after completing a series of drills, 'we've entered badlands plasma fields and begun our search for eddington.' steady. watch those gyros. check the status of torpedoes three and four. we have an energy variance on the plasma warheads. forward scanners are not functioning. where are those field stabilisers? engine room, bridge. where are those field stabilisers? engine room reports field stabilisers should be on-line in 15 minutes. i've got something. it's a small neutrino signature, bearing 218, mark 135. distance approximately 900 kilometres. it's moving. it's a maquis raider. helm, set intercept course. engine room, three-quarter impulse. incoming transmission from the maquis raider. it's eddington. put him through. well, well. mr eddington. you couldn't resist the temptation to come after me. - i like to finish what i start. - you will be disappointed... again. you won't get me, captain. but i have a consolation prize for you. - actually, it's more of a gift. - incoming transmission. - sending over a document. - it's a book. one of my favourites. - ""les misérables."" - thank you but i've read it. recently? if not, you should read it again. pay close attention to the character of inspector javert, the policeman who spends 20 years chasing a man for stealing bread. - sound like anyone you know? - beam over and we'll discuss it. closing on the maquis ship. 700 kilometres. - ready weapons. - phaser banks charged. - lock target. - locked. it's over. why don't you surrender your vessel and prepare to be boarded? it's tempting, but i have other plans. enjoy the book. the neutrino readings are dissipating. it's not a ship. it's an unmanned probe set to transmit a false warp signature. he wanted to lure us here. why? he's up to something, outside the plasma fields. helm. get us out of here. engines at full impulse. hard to port. full thrusters. course 180, mark 0. chief o'brien doesn't recommend more velocity through the plasma fields. - objection noted. get me more speed. - more speed. sir, picking up a distress signal. it's the starship malinche. they've been ambushed by the marquis. it's dead in space. how can we help you, captain? our warp core matrix compositor is fused, our navigational systems are disabled. if you spare some micro-power relays we'll have the engines back on-line in a day or two. engine room. beam a damage control team to the malinche. tell them to take along a dozen micro-power relays. we got a distress signal from a cardassian freighter. they'd just been attacked by the maquis. suffered some casualties. our sensors confirmed this but when we lowered the shields... the sensor readings had been faked. there were no cardassians. the maquis had rigged it so that we lost helm control. by the time we got back, three maquis raiders came out of the plasma field. well... it seems i couldn't get the job done either, captain. - it's not over. - i figured you'd be going after him. we have something that may be useful. we intercepted a coded message from one of eddington's raiders. maybe you can decode it. our computers are still down. - i appreciate it. - do me a favour? - of course. - save me a seat at his court-martial. - count on it. - good hunting, captain. 'captain's log, supplemental. 'with the defiant's computers still not operational we're relying on odo 'to decipher the maquis message. 'for now, we're combing the dmz, hoping to encounter eddington. 'but with each passing hour our hopes are fading.' sir, incoming transmission. it's odo. - captain. - odo, we need some good news. - tell me that you have some. - possibly. - i've analysed the maquis message. - and? it appears to be a simple breen nursery rhyme. a heterophonic, five-line verse. quite a catchy one, too. what does it mean? metrical analysis shows an alternating tetrameter and pentameter structure. but the computer found no meaningful pattern. they are nonsensical phrases strung together because they rhyme... at least to the breen. - and the music? - it's written on a lyxian scale. i ran it through the computer - no meaningful pattern. - so we're nowhere. - i wouldn't say that. i remembered something that eddington said to me. ""the best place to hide something is in plain sight.” and since this is a breen nursery rhyme... is he using the music as a signal to rendezvous in the breen system? or a breen settlement like the one on portas v, not far from the dmz. the biogenic components of his weapons are very bulky and unstable. they need to be kept in a large, sophisticated cold-storage unit. and if anyone knows how to keep things cold, it's the breen. - thank you, odo. - captain. mr worf, do we have a series of sensor relays near portas v? yes, sir. two class-5 intelligence drones. pull their sensor logs. i want to see who's been visiting the breen system. 'captain's log, supplemental. odo's hunch has proven accurate. 'our drones detected a maquis freighter entering portas v three hours ago. 'the freighter was last seen headed into the dorvan sector of the dmz' considering the freighter's range, velocity and heading, eddington's next target is one of four cardassian colonies. but these targets are unlikely. their defence systems were recently upgraded by the cardassians. eddington isn't looking for a fight. that leaves only quatal and panora. quatal has a lucrative mining operation and their weapon systems are being upgraded, but they're not fully operational. - a tempting target. - not as tempting as panora. the maquis attacked them two months ago. now they're almost helpless. there are constant ion storms in that system - good places to hide if you want to mount a surprise attack. a tactic eddington knows well. panora is a more logical target. then eddington will attack quatal. he likes being unpredictable. - approaching quatal prime. - slow to impulse power. full scan. activate parabolic sensor arrays. initiate lateral scanners. we're too late. eddington's detonated his weapon. the nerve agent is spreading through the planet's atmosphere. which means the cardassians don't have much time to get away. - eddington's always one step ahead. - maybe not this time. i'm reading residual neutrino levels. looks like maquis raiders. - they're on the run. - go after them. full impulse. on screen. shields up. charge phaser banks. - how long to intercept? - 15 seconds. hard to port. stick with this one, old man. - they've locked phasers on us. - power to forward shields. - lock target. - targeting scanners synchronised. fire! helm, bring us about. one more to go. sir, this one's making another run for the planet. i don't get it. they've already poisoned the atmosphere. more speed. they've locked phasers on one of the cardassian evacuation ships. they've disabled the transport. it's losing power. - it's going down. - can we beam the crew off? we're out of transporter range. incoming transmission. well, javert... let's see how deep your obsession with me is. you've got me. i can't outrun or outfight the defiant, but... if you come after me, you'll have to pay a price. you'll have to let those cardassians spiral down to their deaths. the choice is yours. - how long do they have? - two minutes to impact. it will probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. they're just cardassians. helm, bring us about. prepare to engage tractor beam. initialising tractor beam. aligning induction field. we've towed the transport ship out of the planet's gravitational pull. once our repair team is back on board, release the tractor beam. the cardassians can limp their way home in a day or two. - ""les misérables""? - you know it? i can't stand victor hugo. i tried reading ""the hunchback of notre dame"", but i couldn't get through it. it was so melodramatic and his heroines are two-dimensional. eddington compares me to one of the characters, inspector javert, a policeman who relentlessly pursues a man named valjean, guilty of a trivial offence. in the end, javert's own inflexibility destroys him. he commits suicide. you can't believe that description fits you. eddington is just trying to get under your skin. he did that eight months ago. it strikes me that eddington said that it's one of his favourites. - there's no accounting for taste. - let's think about it. a starfleet security officer is fascinated by a 19th-century french melodrama, and now he's a leader of the maquis, a resistance group fighting the noble battle against the ""evil"" cardassians. it sounds like he's living out his own fantasy. exactly. and you know what? ""les misérables” isn't about the policeman. it's about valjean, the victim of a monstrous injustice, who spends his entire life helping people, making noble sacrifices for others. that's how eddington sees himself. he's valjean. he's robin hood. he's a romantic figure, fighting the good fight against insurmountable odds. the secret life of michael eddington. - how does it help us? - eddington is the hero of his own story. that makes me the villain. what is it that every hero wants to do? - kill the bad guy. - that's part of it. heroes only kill when they have to. eddington could have killed me when he disabled the defiant. but, in the best melodramas, the villain creates a situation where the hero is forced to sacrifice himself for the people, for the cause. one final, grand gesture. - what are you getting at? - it's time for me to become the villain. commander. prepare two quantum torpedoes. have engineering attach a cargo pod with 200 kilograms of trilithium. yes, sir, but the extra mass of a cargo pod will make the torpedo less effective. maquis raiders are small and manoeuvrable. i'm not planning to fire at any ships, mr worf. major. what is the nearest maquis colony? - solosos iii. less than an hour away. - helm, set a course for solosos iii. major, i want you to send the following message on all maquis frequencies. to all the members of the maquis resistance. this is captain sisko of the u.s.s. defiant. in response to the maquis' use of biogenic weapons, i am about to take the following action. in exactly one hour, i will detonate two quantum torpedoes that will scatter trilithium resin into the atmosphere of solosos iii, making the planet uninhabitable to all human life for the next 50 years. i suggest evacuation plans begin immediately. what are you waiting for, people? carry out your orders. set torpedo targets to 50 kilometres above ground level. - lock. ready, captain. - time? one minute left. still no transport ship activity or any sign of evacuation. commander worf, prepare to fire torpedoes on my mark. detach safeties on torpedoes. incoming transmission. it's eddington. what are you really up to, javert? you expect me to believe that a decorated starfleet officer is going to poison an entire planet? that's exactly what i'm going to do. - you're bluffing. - am i? commander, launch torpedoes. commander, i said launch torpedoes. aye, sir. the trilithium resin is dissipating throughout the biosphere. the maquis are scrambling their ships and starting to evacuate. do you realise what you've done? i'm going to eliminate every maquis colony in the dmz. you'll be turning hundreds of thousands of people into refugees. when you attacked the malinche, you proved that the maquis have become a threat to the security of the federation. i will eliminate that threat. but think about those people you saw. they didn't attack the malinche. you should have thought about that before attacking a federation starship. helm, lay in a course for tracken ii, warp six. commander, prepare two more torpedoes. - set course 050, mark 179. - unlock safeties on torpedoes. can't you see what's happening to you? you're going against everything you believe in to satisfy a vendetta. - you betrayed your uniform! - and you're betraying yours, right now. the sad part is, you don't even realise it. i feel sorry for you, captain. this obsession with me... look what it's cost you. shut that thing up. commander worf, prepare to launch torpedoes. wait! if you call off your attack i'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. not enough. all right, javert. i'll give you what you want... me. 'captain's log, supplemental. 'resettlement efforts in the dmz are underway. 'the cardassian and maquis colonists 'will make new lives on the planets their counterparts evacuated. 'balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains unstable.' captain. commander. welcome home. - it's good to be back. - i gather your trip was productive? - constable. - this way. benjamin, i'm curious. your plan to poison the maquis planets... you didn't clear it with starfleet first, did you? - i knew i'd forgotten to do something. - big gamble. that's what it takes to be a good villain. sometimes i like it when the bad guy wins. english"
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0," as time passes, a boy inevitably becomes a man. but what is not inevitable is that a man becomes a warrior. a warrior must be forged, like a sword, tempered by... ...by... ...tempered by experience. the path of a warrior begins with... - alexander. - no, wait! sorry. i didn't mean to hit you. - what is the meaning of this? - i'm sorry. we made fullerenes at chemistry class and filled them with water. i asked you to meet me here. i have been waiting. i forgot. you forgot because you allowed yourself to be distracted. i'm sorry. there is something very important i want to discuss. it concerns your future. sit. as time passes, a boy inevitably becomes a man, but what is not inevitable is that a man becomes a sword. - what? - i meant, warrior. the path of a warrior begins with the first rite of ascension. when they hit you with painstiks? no, that is the second rite. you are approaching the age of ascension. - it is time for you to prepare. - what do i have to do? your fighting skills will be tested and your knowledge of the teachings of kahless. it will be challenging, but i will help you prepare. these are the kor'tova candles. they represent the fire within the heart of a warrior. when you light yours, you declare your intention to become a warrior. - go ahead. - what if i don't want to? if you do not participate in the rite before 13 years, you will never become a true klingon warrior. i don't care. you may not now, but you might. mother said i didn't have to do this klingon stuff if i didn't want to. - it is your decision... - ok, then. - i'm not going to do it. - alexander. you said it was up to me. i don't want to be a warrior. space, the final frontier. these are the voyages of the starship enterprise. its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. we can't rendezvous with the kearsarge for four days. will we hold position here? yes. and as we're in for a relatively quiet time, i shall visit the hatarian system. there are some ancient ruins being excavated. the delay allows stellar dynamics to complete their study of the vodrey nebula. they can use the lateral-sensor grid. we could use this time to recalibrate the weapons-targeting system. mr worf? yes. i will begin the procedure immediately. very good. dismissed. lieutenant, could i have a word with you for a moment? i noticed during the briefing that you appeared to be a bit distracted. i apologise. my personal affairs should not interfere with my duties. is everything alright? i'm having problems with alexander. he does not wish to participate in the first rite of ascension. i see. i try to tell him that it is important in a young klingon's life, but he does not understand. he's had so little opportunity to spend time with klingons. you know, the festival of kot'baval is tomorrow. if he could take part in that, he would more fully appreciate his rich cultural heritage. there is the klingon outpost on maranga iv. they'll be celebrating the festival. yes. but the outpost is on the other side of the vodrey nebula. it would take three days by shuttle. the enterprise could be there in a fraction of the time. i could not ask you... stellar dynamics would like a trip around the nebula. thank you, sir. who's that? it is the tyrant molor. he was so strong, no one could stand against him. what's he saying? he is asking if anyone else will stand up to molor. what is this? you wounded me. - you fought well. - what happens now? only one man can stand against molor. it's kahless. kahless would rather die than live under molor's tyranny. kahless! father. - where have you been? - we watched the fire dancers. - we? - k'nor and bar'el. they live here. i need some money. what for? the man there says he has molor's head in a box. the real molor. that is impossible. the real molor died centuries ago. i know. it's mummified. he'll show us for 50 darseks. - he is trying to take your money. - please. he's waiting. no. it is too late. we should go. - but... - alexander. that is enough. come. it is time to go. i have to say goodbye to my friends. see your friends tomorrow. - we're coming back? - if you want to. run! - you are too much for them. - i have seen you before. - who are you? - a friend. you are k'mtar. your brother sent me here to protect you. - he is gin'tak to the house of mogh. - gin'tak? an adviser so trusted, he is part of the family. do you know who was behind the attack? it is a klingon matter. it is not your concern. one of my officers was almost killed. that makes it my concern. recently, rumours began to circulate on the homeworld that an assassination attempt would be made on the family of mogh. kurn sent me here to make sure nothing happened to worf. why didn't you warn him before the attack? i tried to contact him over subspace. i was told he was not aboard. i decided to beam directly to the surface. why didn't you let us know? forgive me for being blunt, but when it comes to protecting the house to which i have pledged my life... ...i trust no one. i have full confidence in the officers with whom i serve. one of the attackers dropped this dagger. the design represents the house of duras. we have other evidence that indicates the duras sisters, lursa and b'etor, were behind it. what were they after? kurn's seat on the council, of course. we cannot allow their attack to go unanswered. first, we must find them. at one point, they were on deep space nine, trying to sell explosives. that was months ago. no one knows where they went from there. maybe we can find them. we've arranged for quarters if you'd like to stay. i would. worf and i have much to discuss. i will send kurn a message telling him what happened. but he will not receive it for days. he's gone... why did you treat cmdr riker disrespectfully? you were rude. i may have been rude by human standards. i meant no disrespect. what is the matter, worf? have you been living so long among humans that you have forgotten how klingons behave? i have not forgotten. their ways are different than ours. i trust your son is aware of that fact. - yes, of course. - good. because alexander may be called upon to lead the house of mogh. kurn has no male heir. he wants to make sure that alexander is preparing himself. does my brother doubt my ability to raise my son as a klingon? no. but you are alone among humans. it cannot be easy to keep our ways. - well, it has not been easy. - how are his fighting skills? - can he handle a bat'leth? - he is learning. - he could be better. - he must. he is nearing the age of ascension. actually, alexander has not committed himself to the rite. what? i have tried to explain how important it is, but he will not listen to me. perhaps together, you and i, we can find a way to spark the boy's interest in his heritage. i would be grateful for any help. - tomorrow, then. - tomorrow. - may i say goodnight to the boy? - yes. of course. - is this your mother? - yeah. she died when i was little. you miss her a great deal, don't you? it must be hard, being the only klingon your age on this ship. sometimes. have you been to the homeworld? - no. - i think you would like it. at your uncle's house, there is a lake you can swim in that is so clear you can see all the way to the bottom. really? you have cousins there. they want to meet you. - i don't know... - i understand. you're afraid. you don't know whether the homeworld is safe. yeah. what happened today on the planet is frightening. you're troubled. i thought they would kill my father. you must have wanted to help us fight them off. i didn't know what to do. someday, if you work hard, you will become a warrior, a klingon warrior, and you will always feel safe because you will know how to defend yourself. i'll tell you something else. if anyone ever tries to hurt your father again, you will be able to fight at his side and make sure nothing happens to him. what do you think of that? goodnight, alexander. dream well. goodnight, k'mtar. any luck? starfleet records contain no mention of the sisters after their departure from deep space nine. did i not tell you as much? have you contacted deep space nine? - i am being patched through now. - on screen. quark. i see you remember me. how could i forget the only man ever to win dabo at my table? how could i forget that you didn't have the latinum for my winnings? i thought i explained. my brother misplaced the key to the safe. those vouchers are every bit as good as latinum. you can spend latinum anywhere. those vouchers are only good at your bar. is that what this is about? you're on your way and calling to reserve a holosuite? i hoped you could help with something. - what would that be? - i'm looking for some friends. the duras sisters, lursa and b'etor. yes. lursa and b'etor. big talk, small tips. where can i find them? well, i did hear a rumour, actually. what kind of rumour? i don't know. i'm sure it was told in confidence. and how much would your confidence cost? how many vouchers do you have again? i have enough for 12 bars of latinum. i'd be glad to return them. i believe the rumour was that the sisters were trying to buy mining equipment. what for? they learned of a magnesite deposit on the kalla system. it belongs to the pakleds. those fools don't know it's there. your friends tried to get at it. alright. i'll send those vouchers to you. don't bother. i voided them while we've been talking. so long, quark. how long to get to the kalla system? - approximately 16 hours, sir. - was he lying? why would he? i'd just be knocking on his door again, and i wouldn't be in a good mood. congratulations, commander. i did not think it would be possible to find the sisters. - take us out of orbit. - aye, sir. i created a holodeck program. - what kind? - i'll show you. computer, run program k'mtar alpha one. program initiated. enter when ready. why did you want to recreate this? you said you wished you had helped your father fight, but you did not know how. you have probably fought that battle over and over in your mind. yes. let's see what happens now. computer, give me two klingon warriors. how can i fight someone that big? size is not the most important thing. skill, cunning, powers of observation are the most important weapons. freeze program. look what this ko'tal is doing. you see his leg? that will give you a clue as to his next move. his weight is on his right foot. he has to shift it to regain his balance. stand ready. computer, resume program. finish him. freeze program. - you should have killed him. - why did you not? - i don't know. - look at him! he did not care that you showed him mercy. he was going to kill you! k'mtar, that is enough. if this was real, he'd be dead by now. alexander. - we are approaching kalla iii. - standard orbit. any evidence of a mining expedition? a shaft has been cut through the crust. there is evidence of machinery but it is not in use. - life signs? - difficult to say. the magnesite is interfering with bioreadings. assemble an away team. - who are you? - gorta. i am gorta. - why are you on this planet? - i crashed here. then you are denying involvement in illegal mining? mining? so that's what all this equipment is for. we are looking for two klingon women. sisters. lursa? b'etor? - do you know where they are? - we were hoping you did. maybe i do. would you share that with us? my personal code of conduct prohibits sharing. but i'd consider a trade. does your code tell you that when you're stranded, you shouldn't try to cut deals? you have a point. we could certainly provide passage in exchange for information. could you perhaps fail to tell the pakleds that we were mining their ore? don't push your luck. but if you get us to the sisters, i'll see. the duras sisters. they are magnificent, aren't they? - where are they now? - selling the ore, i imagine. they took everything. the ore, the ship. where have they gone? we were going to sell the ore to an yridian trader in the ufandi system. gather your belongings. it is time to leave. like i said, they took everything. worf. i am sorry about what happened. i should not have gotten so angry. it's just that i am worried about alexander. as am i. kurn told me that his mother actively discouraged him exploring his klingon heritage. when he came to live with me, he knew nothing of our ways. he often reminds me of the things his mother said to him. i try not to disregard her wishes. i want him to honour his mother. someday, he will appreciate you and be grateful for all that you have done for him. but still, compared to other boys his age, his fighting skills are years behind. yes, i know. he does not put in the time it takes to learn the skills. i thought that you might send him to the training academy at ogat. your brother is an influential man. i'm sure he could get alexander admitted. ogat? i am only thinking of what is best for the boy. there, he would learn our ways. he would live like a klingon. i would like him to learn our ways. no. this is his home. how can you expect him to lead our family when all he knows is life aboard a federation starship? he is my son. he belongs with me. the boy is more human than klingon. if he stays here, he will never be a warrior. he will never defend our family - against its enemies. - enough! the decision is mine. not necessarily. it's within my rights to invoke ya'nora kor. you would question my fitness to raise my son? for the good of our house, yes. i beg of you, please stop thinking of yourself. it is alexander we should be considering. look into your heart and do what is best for him. kahless was determined to teach his brother a lesson because he had told a lie. but morath refused to fight him and instead ran away. kahless pursued him across the valleys, over the mountains and down to the edge of the sea. there, at the shore, they fought for... ...12 days, 12 nights. i've heard this story before. alexander, it is important to tell these stories, even though we already know them. why was kahless so mad about the lie? it made him look like a coward. if kahless had explained, they wouldn't have to fight about it. - you miss the point. - was morath wrong to run away? maybe he didn't want to have to fight his brother and kill him. he ran because he was a coward. - how do you know? - no more questions. these are our stories. it is important for a warrior to learn how to interpret them properly. - i'm trying to... - no. your head is filled with foolish human notions about how things are. you are klingon. it is time you began to act like one. - i am part human, too. - listen to me, alexander. when a human looks at you, he does not see himself. - he sees a klingon. - it doesn't matter what i look like. it does. you are different than everyone else aboard this ship. - that's not true. - it is. the only way that you will ever feel as if you truly belong is to leave here and go and live with your own kind. i know a klingon school. you would be welcome there. they would teach you to be a warrior, prepare you for the rite of ascension. i don't know if i want that. after you were there for a while, you would find that you wouldn't want anything else. - i don't want to leave the ship. - you must. everything depends upon it. i thought you were different. i thought you understood me. but you don't. you're just like my father. all you care about is me becoming a warrior. leave me alone. first officer's log, stardate 47779.4. we've entered the ufandi system, where we believe the duras sisters have come to sell the ore they mined on kalla iii. i am detecting a vessel near the third planet. - it is a yridian freighter. - on screen. scan for magnesite in its hold. the resonant signature indicates that there is magnesite ore present. then we're too late. the sisters have been here. somehow, i doubt the yridians will be forthcoming. sir. readings indicate that there are 500kg of ore in the yridian hold. - there should be over 10,000kg. - that's odd. hail them. i'm cmdr william riker from the federation starship enterprise. i am yog. why are we speaking? our sensors indicate you're carrying magnesite ore. magnesite, yes. - where did you get it? - from a corvallan. - for a good price. - where is this corvallan now? i'm under orders to acquire some magnesite. he is gone. where? who is to know? would you sell me the ore? no. - i have a buyer. - you haven't heard my offer. half a gram of anjoran biomimetic gel. done. once we verify the purity of your ore, we'll beam over the gel. you're up to something. have the transporter room beam the ore to these coordinates. sir. that would place the ore off the starboard bow. i know. transport complete. lock on the ore and fire. firing. a klingon bird-of-prey. - put a tractor beam on it. - how did you know? the yridians only had part of the shipment. we arrived before they completed the transfer. - the klingon ship is hailing us. - on screen. - release our vessel at once. - i don't think so. we've done nothing wrong. a simple business transaction. we know you're dealing in stolen ore. i want to talk about the assassination attempt on lt worf. what assassination attempt? this is the first i've heard of it. too bad it didn't succeed. we have evidence you're behind it. - that is outrageous. - what is this evidence? beam over. we'll show you. we'll be there shortly. this was dropped by one of the assassins. it bears your crest. someone must have given it to the assassins to implicate us. why would someone do that? in order to tarnish our good name. you cannot tarnish a rusted blade. mr worf! you said there was other evidence that they were involved. yes. on the homeworld. we'll set a course. i want this cleared up. i will send a message to kurn. he may wish to return to the homeworld as well. impossible. what is it? these markings represent the members of our house. this symbol represents our father, myself, my sister. this represents her son. - i was not aware you had a son. - i do not. but i am with child. she found out only a few days ago and told no one but me. how can this marking be here? where did this come from? i will speak with k'mtar. father. stop. i am your son. i am alexander. what are you saying? i am your son alexander. i have come to this time from 40 years in the future. k'mtar, tell me the truth, or i will kill you. look at me. when we first met, you said i looked familiar. maybe i saw you on the homeworld. no! look closely. i am your son. if you are alexander, you will remember your mother's last words before she died. i was three years old. she was dying when we found her. she barely managed to whisper my name. and then she took my hand and placed it in yours. then she died. and then you howled in rage and said, ""look upon her. look upon death and always remember."" and i always have. how have you done this, come to this time? i met a man in the cambra system. he gave me a chance to change the past. he had the ability to send me to this time. you came here to end your own life? i was hoping that i would not have to, that i could change things, that i could change myself. but i could not. now everything is going to turn out like it did before. i cannot let that happen. but why? what will happen that is so terrible? you will be killed because i was too naive, too weak to be able to protect you. i do not believe that. i was there! i saw you murdered. i was to blame. - you must not blame yourself. - you don't understand. i did not become a warrior. i was a diplomat, a peacemaker. when it came my time to lead our family, i thought that i could single-handedly end the fighting between the great houses. i announced that the house of mogh would end the feuding, that there would be no more retribution or revenge. you tried to warn me, to tell me i should not show weakness. but i thought you were a foolish old man. i told you that you were a relic from an earlier time and that a new era of peace was at hand. but you were right. my enemies saw my weakness and moved against me. and unless i stop it right now, that boy will see his father killed on the floor of the great council chamber. that is why you wanted to turn him into a warrior. i staged the assassination attempt to try and frighten him, to make him realise that he must follow the ways of the warrior. if i had listened to you, if i become the warrior that you had wanted me to be... ...you would not have died in my arms. no. who knows the future will be now that you have disrupted time? i may die tomorrow. i may outlive you. but when i die, i would like an honourable death. the only way that is possible is for you to accept yourself as you are and stay true to what you believe. the cause of peace is a just cause. the struggle must continue. it is a futile struggle. i cannot change things. you have already changed things more than you realise. - the boy i was has not changed. - but i have. you have given me a glimpse into my son's future, and i know now that he has his own destiny. and i believe it will be a great one. i love you, father. and i, you, alexander. i've been waiting. where's k'mtar? he had to leave. he was called away. he never said goodbye. he asked me to say goodbye for him. he wanted me to tell you, no matter what you do with your life, he will always care for you. - when will i see him again? - it may be a long time. - we should start practice. - alexander. there will be plenty of time for training."
1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"do i look like i'm joking? evade. - she has him. - she's down 50 strips. - not for long. - what makes you so sure? jadzia's playing a very deep game. her strategy will become apparent any moment. i see. you have absolutely no idea how this game is played, do you? no. but i have developed a new appreciation for it. - since when? - since i married a tongo player. one thing i am certain about - she will defeat the bartender. i don't know about that. quark's on a roll. in the last month, he's won 206 straight games. will you bet on the outcome? i wouldn't want to bet against a man's wife. - if you are afraid... - name your stakes. a bottle of bloodwine against a bottle of whisky. done. a sale at 50 and a purchase at 100. pretty big talk for a lady who's lost 50 strips. you think i can't cover my bets? no. i just hate to kick somebody when they're down. i'll buy at 100 and confront. if you kick me i'll have to kick back. unbelievable! eshta, par'machkai! i like my bloodwine very young and very sweet. - is he a friend of yours? - just a fan. i'm going to have to disappoint all your fans. - a full consortium? - 207. a single malt, something from the highlands. - i will need some time. - your credit's good. 207 straight. 36 strips of gold-pressed latinum. - did you lose a bet? - it doesn't matter. i'm sorry about that. i would rather lose a bet on you than win on someone else. ooh, good response. - are you running that drill tomorrow? - yes. why? i want to recalibrate the external sensors before the night watch comes on duty. we should be done by 1600 hours. i think that'll work. oh, the sutherland is going to be here day after tomorrow and... - you were saying? - nothing. i don't feel like talking anymore. kira to worf. - worf here. - sorry to bother you, but i need to see you both in the captain's office. we're on our way. - jadzia, get up. - i'm coming! hey! i'll get right to it. starfleet has been receiving intelligence from a cardassian operative. he has now sent an emergency signal indicating he needs to speak to someone face-to-face. in 13 hours he'll beam an encrypted subspace transmission to these coordinates in the badlands. who is the operative? his name is lasaran. but that's all intelligence will say. they did emphasise that he is very important to them and we should send someone to the badlands. so with the defiant gone and most of the runabouts off with the ninth fleet... we just volunteered for a trip to the badlands. the shenandoah is ready to go on landing pad a. good luck. no? i'm not hiking across vulcan's forge in the middle of their summer. - you want to see the forge. - see it, yes. honeymoon there, no. there's a mountain-climbing expedition on andor. worf, my love. let me make this very clear. i do not want to spend my honeymoon climbing, hiking, bleeding or suffering in any way. - what do you want? - room service. i want to be pampered. i want a staff to cater to our every whim. i want to be embarrassed by the size of our room. i want a balcony with a view that would make you cry from the beauty of it all and i don't want to spend one moment of our honeymoon suffering from anything except guilt about our complete self-indulgence. - risa. - not this time. welcome to casperia prime, the vacation capital of the horvian cluster. you have been planning this all along. it seemed fair. you did plan the wedding. - very well. room service. - really? - really. - that was easy. did you want to fight over it? no. it's just... i didn't expect you to surrender so quickly. - surrender? - bad word. ok. but you have been unusually accommodating lately. - what is wrong with that? - nothing. it's just... unusual. - are you feeling all right? - i am a married man. i have to make certain adjustments in my lifestyle. adjustments? worf, you're practically easygoing. - what's next, a sense of humour? - i have a sense of humour! on the enterprise i was considered amusing. that must've been one dull ship. that is a joke. i get it. it is not funny, but i get it. i don't know if i can get used to the new you. it's kind of eerie. your problem is you cannot accept change. - i can't accept change? - that is correct. you've got to be kidding. i've changed bodies six times. - you are still very set in your ways. - and look who's talking. i do not have to sleep on the same side of the bed every night or brush my hair exactly 50 strokes every night or eat the same thing for breakfast every day or read the last page of the book first, or... i get the point. how can you live with someone so monotonous? it is not easy. that was a joke. this is going to be a very, very long trip. come in. you're not dressed. - is it time? - 1700 on the dot. we have a holosuite for three hours. three british agents have disappeared. mi5 suspects the soviets were involved. the americans have intercepted... - what are you doing? - i'm brushing up on my game. - you play tongo? - sure. well, i used to. i played a game once, a long time ago, with a ferengi privateer and a romulan mercenary. the americans have intercepted a series of messages from istanbul to an island in the south pacific. let's play a hand. just one hand. - why? - i need the practice. - i want to beat quark. - good luck. luck has nothing to do with it. tongo is a game of strategy and calculated risk. - i don't even know the rules. - here. let's play. shenandoah log, stardate 51597.2. we have arrived at the designated coordinates and are awaiting lasaran's transmission. - this is it. - very sophisticated. whoever he is, he's good. - who are you? - i'm commander worf. this is commander dax. we are here to receive your transmission. - why did they have to send a klingon? - i'm a trill. is that better? - are you trying to be funny? - not at all. he's the funny one. - what is it you want? - we'll get to that. first i have something that you want - information on the founders. i know how many are in the alpha quadrant, where they are and what they're doing. - we're listening. - i'm sure you are. now let's talk about what i want. - i want out. now. - you want to defect. the vorta advisor here is asking questions, making security checks in my section. i can't stay here any longer. starfleet intelligence will arrange to bring you out. i can't wait for that. in 15 minutes i am leaving here for the dominion base on soukara. this may be the last time they'll let me leave here. so i need to take advantage of this opportunity. soukara is inside dominion space. it will not be easy to make a rendezvous near that planet. don't work your brain too hard. i've taken care of it. three days from now, at exactly 1730 hours local time, i will leave the base and walk into the jungle. it'll be two days before they know i'm missing. all you have to do is get me off the planet. transporter scramblers protect soukara so you can't beam me aboard. you're going to have to land and meet me at a rendezvous point on foot. i am sending you all the information you'll need to avoid the sensors. follow my instructions. meet me at this rendezvous point and have a ship waiting. - we've got the information. - we will need time to study the plans. i don't have time. once i leave here, i can't contact you again. i have to know if you're going to be there or not and i have to know now! we will be there. how far i've fallen... risking my life on the word of a klingon. three days. don't be late. all right. i'll buy at 30 with sales at 35. buy at 35, sell at 150 and index the margin at ten per cent. - ""index the margin""? - give it up. - this just isn't your game. - we'll see about that. evade. do you realise that quark has won 207 straight games of tongo? - so? - so someone has to beat him. - and that someone is you? - why not? for one thing, you can't play tongo. confront. - damn! - had enough? - not by a long shot. - it'll take 20 years to take on quark. one more. why are you so determined to beat him? - it's the challenge. - challenge? why do you think i became an engineer? the challenge. what do you think has kept me kayaking for the last seven years? the challenge. why would i play darts against somebody genetically engineered? - the challenge. - exactly. i have keep my mind off the fact that keiko's been away for six months. hold on. maybe i can't beat quark... but you can. you and your genetically engineered brain. - i've only just learned how to play. - yeah, in about ten seconds flat. we can do it, julian. we can beat him. ""we""? you're talking about me. you're good at calculation but weak on strategy. - i'll be your coach. - no, thank you. - think of it as a challenge. - that's not my obsession. - do it for the latinum. - nice try. do it for the satisfaction of the look on quark's face when he's beaten at a game of tongo by a lowly ""hew-mon."" deal the cards. - we are approaching soukara. - stand by to bring us out of warp. now. there is an asteroid field directly ahead. the dominion's sensor grid has three gaps and they're all in that field. - want me to slow down? - not unless you think you should. - not at all. in fact, it could go faster. - by all means. a man after my own heart. most impressive. nothing that any 300-year-old pilot couldn't do. - we are being scanned. - taking evasive manoeuvres. - did they get a fix on us? - i do not think so. good. we've come too long a way just to get shot down. i'll scan the surface for a landing site. there's the base, the rendezvous point and the dominion sensor perimeter. there's a valley 20 kilometres north of the rendezvous point. it's a long way but we can't risk taking the ship any closer. agreed. we have less than two days to get there. ten kilometres a day shouldn't be too bad. do not underestimate the task. we have to penetrate the sensor grid and avoid the dominion patrols. find a man in an alien jungle, then walk him out without getting caught. easy. - ready? - after you. ok. go to 25 joules. 25 joules. - done. - that's it. we're linked. here. check my work. encryption lockouts bypassed, tricorder linked to their sensors, life signs masked. - nicely done. - thank you. our tricorders will be useless from now on. you're looking for the cloud in the silver lining! i am not complaining. i look forward to walking through the jungle without a map and no idea of what lies ahead. the funny thing is you probably do. this is a ferengi-only game. - you let dax play. - she's an exception. the only one. - you're afraid i'll clean you out. - i'm afraid you'll ruin the game for us. i think i can keep up. but can you keep up with me? don't try and scare me with that genetically engineered intellect. tongo is more than just number crunching. - no computer can master this game. - then you shouldn't worry. you realise we are not playing for drinks. - this is a high-stakes game. - we came to play. gentlemen? all right. the buy-in is five strips, and you're dealing. - you better get off to a fast start. - they won't know what hit them. buy at 300, sell at 350. ach! you're a quick study, doctor. - you mean quick for a ""hew-mon""? - i'd never say that during a game. - you'd wait until it was over. - of course. evade. dax was a quick study, too. it only took her two weeks to win her first match. dax specialises in the unexpected. still buying at 300, selling at four. i'd like to index the margin at 20%. interesting. she did the unexpected when she married commander boring. - that's for sure. - at first i thought to give it two months. i'll buy at 400 and sell at five. i had the same thought, although i only gave it a month. confront. - she's a real heartbreaker, that one. - that she is. leverage the buy-in, and sell at 550. you know, you go through a lot of ups and downs in my business. when the profits are down and the customers are scarce you think you'll never see another strip of latinum again. and then jadzia comes in and flashes that smile of hers. suddenly things don't seem so bad after all. i know exactly what you mean. you know, sometimes she walks past and all she does is wink. somehow that makes my whole day look a little brighter. focus, julian. focus. i'll... buy that 550, and index the exchange at ten. - and now she's married. - married. out of reach. i'm converting my reserves and selling at 600. you know what's really sad, what really keeps me awake at night? she's out of reach because we let her go. i suppose so. but some things just weren't meant to be. - evade. - julian. are you sure you want to...? please. you know the rules. no coaching during a round. you're probably right. but what if that's a convenient rationalisation? what if deep down we both know she's something unique, something we may never see again - a chance at true happiness? and we let her slip through our fingers. what if 50 years from now we each look back and say, ""what a fool i was""? confront. doctor? - confront. - oh. sorry. um... full consortium. - total monopoly. - what? - you seem to be out of money. - miles? - we're busted. - thanks for the game. - welcome back anytime. - wait. quark, did you really mean all that? about dax being my one last chance for true happiness? doctor, you don't expect me to show you all my cards, do you? - you lost. - what happened to ""we""? we weren't mooning over lost love with a ferengi holding a total monopoly. - all that was meant to distract me? - obviously. - i can't believe i let him get to me. - not your fault. genetically engineered or not, you're still ""hew-mon."" - i guess. - let's get a drink. let's not stand on pride, shall we? trills don't like the heat and klingons don't like the cold. - thank you. - you're welcome. how are you enjoying your honeymoon? - are you suffering enough? - almost. is there anything i can get for you? more pain. less cold. i don't know why that's funny but it is. - mating call? - 500 metres. that way. - that didn't take long. - less than 300 metres. another happy couple. when i was a boy, my father used to take my brother and me on camping trips. we would listen to the wolves howling in the distance. nikolai was afraid but i would lay in my tent for hours, just listening. i remember being seized by the urge to just rip off my clothes and run into the night and live in the forest and become something wild. he must have been rejected. he's moving away. - she's not happy. - aren't they're getting further away? yes, but it is because something is coming. and it is close. jadzia! - lie still. - i think i can do that. can i have the good news first? - no vital organs were damaged. - now the bad news? the disruptor burst left an anti-coagulant in your system. - so you can't stop the bleeding? - no. i must not have taken the whole burst. i'm not haemorrhaging that bad yet. keep me pumped full of painkillers and let's go. - moving could make it worse. - staying here isn't an option. someone's going to come looking for them. i'd rather take my chances on foot. you ready? - you ready? - ready. let's go. we are twelve kilometres from the rendezvous point. and only 20 hours left. well, it's time we stop having so much fun and pick up the pace, huh? more plasma? no, thanks. i'm full. your blood pressure has dropped another 20%. love that bedside manner. you should have been a doctor. your bandage will need to be changed soon. i think i'd like a blue chiffon bandage this time. maybe rhinestones. something with pizzazz. this is no joking matter. you are seriously injured. - i'm just trying to lighten the mood. - this is neither the time nor the place. what happened to that new worf? the one with the sense of humour. - that was a mistake. - what is that supposed to mean? if i had not been joking with you i would not have allowed the jem'hadar to get so close. - so this is all my fault. - no. it is mine. i was trying to be something i am not. by letting down my guard i allowed my wife to be injured and i put the entire mission in jeopardy. - it will not happen again. - that's not what happened. - without our tricorders... - i do not wish to debate this. we have a long way to go and very little time. fine. let's go. ready? hypo. there. good as new. - i have to change your dressing. - that's four bandages in two hours. that's got to be some kind of record. sorry. i forgot the new rules. nothing funny. got to be serious. life and death. we've got a job to do. jadzia, i know you are tired, but we have to cover three kilometres before nightfall. can you do it? as long as you got those painkillers, i'll follow you through the gates of hell, sir. that was almost a smile. when this mission is over, i will smile all you want. - you promise? - i promise. then let's finish this mission and get out of here. i can stand. just help me get my balance. i got my balance. maybe not. let me guess. things aren't looking up. your blood pressure has dropped and your neural edl readings are erratic. so what's your prescription, doc? - surgery. at a starbase. - could i get a second opinion? worf, you have to go on without me... and i know that. i understand. i must complete the mission, regardless of my feelings. absolutely. you're a starfleet officer. so am i. and i understand. the information lasaran has could be invaluable to the war effort. you don't have to explain to me. i'm hurt. you're not. and there's a job to be done. i will be back tomorrow night. don't worry. i'm not going anywhere. i can have you in the stasis chamber on the runabout in 45 hours. no problem. i will leave the med kit. scan yourself every half hour. the plasma hypospray will be set... i took basic first aid. i know what i have to do. worf... it's been a great two months, hasn't it? yes. - jadzia, i just want to tell you how... - just kiss me and go. what's the word? she is still in surgery but dr bashir is hopeful she will make a full recovery. lasaran's dead. starfleet intercepted a transmission saying he had been killed trying to re-enter soukara. - could you have made the meeting? - yes. - yet you turned back to save jadzia. - yes. did you know that the information he had could have saved millions of lives? - yes. - so what happened? - you may not understand. - try me, sir. at my wedding, you heard the story of the first two klingon hearts. nothing could stand against them. they even destroyed the gods that created them. i have heard that story since i was a boy but i never understood it, i mean really understood it, until i was standing in the jungle with my heart pounding in my chest, and i found that even i could not stand against my own heart. i had to go back and it did not matter what the consequences were. she was my wife, and i could not leave her. as your captain, it is my duty to inform you that you made the wrong choice. i don't think starfleet will file any formal charges. even a secret court-martial would reveal too much about intelligence. but this will go into your service record. and to be completely honest, you probably won't be offered a command on your own after this. - i understand. - i've also issued new orders. you and jadzia are not to be assigned to a mission on your own ever again. and one last thing. as a man who had a wife... if jennifer had been lying in that clearing... i wouldn't have left her either. hey. i know you. - we have met. - oh, you're joking again. that's a good sign. did you make the rendezvous? no. i could not leave you there. not for lasaran, not for the mission, not for anything else. lasaran? dead. - are you in trouble? - i have been in trouble before. i'm sorry. i should have kept going. you have nothing to be sorry about. i know how much your career means to you. you come first, before career, before duty, before anything. i do not regret what i did. and i would do it again. i don't know what to say. you could say, ""thank you for saving my life.” thank you for saving my life. and you could say, ""i would do the same for you, worf."" well, i'd have to think about that. my career is very important to me, you know. and you could say, ""i love you."" i love you. and i love you."
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"congratulations, annie. it's all yours. it's hard to believe. scott, that goes to the downstairs bath. i don't know how... we're ever going to be able to afford this... but it is perfect. there's only one thing missing. get me the dolly, will you? i remember that photo. even czonka's smiling. you sent it out as a christmas card last year. mm-hmm. it belongs right there, doesn't it? mm. mom! sean says i have dragon breath! you don't believe me, go ahead and sniff her. i hate that photo. that dress makes me look chunky! - what dress doesn't?

you'll be fine, annie. call me if you need anything, ok? - philip. - thank you. annie, i just have to say that you were right. it feels just like home already. czonka! what? what? what? oh, boy. don't tell me it's only moving day. where'd i put those paper towels? honey, relax. phillip, we've been here fifteen minutes... and already the hardwood is scraped... and the fireplace is stained. they're kids, annie. the dog got excited. phillip, this is supposed to be a fresh start, a new beginning. just because we have a new house... doesn't mean we're gonna turn into a new family. sometimes i wish we could. annie had it on the truck. does that make me a terrible person? don't worry. it'll be our little secret. czonka, you bad dog! go give mommy some love. oh. very funny. don't tell me... czonka's already made a new friend. what are you talking about? come here, czonk. come here. good boy! who's my champ! that's right, czonka is! what's wrong? stop screwing around, phillip. i mean it. this isn't funny. if you bought another dog... do you know what mommy is talking about? of course you don't. neither do i. this is the wrong day for silly games. perfection. isn't that something we all yearn for? annie macintosh does. she wants the perfect house, the perfect family... the perfect life... but she's about to learn that perfection is an illusion... and a terrifying one at that... in the twilight zone. you're traveling to another dimension... a dimension not only of sight and sound... but of mind. a journey into a wondrous land... whose boundaries are only that of the imagination. you're entering... satisfied? i don't understand. what happened to czonka? i really wish you'd stop saying that. you're gonna give him a complex. that is not my dog. well, i don't know what to tell you. look at his akc papers. look at his ribbons, his champion certificate. - how much proof do you need? - it's not my dog! annie, you love this dog! hell, there are days you think you like him better than me. why are you pretending you don't recognize him? go away. phillip, get him away. czonka, sit. sean is stapling his posters to the wall. you're a traitor, you know that? - and they shoot traitors. - leave me alone! - is that a new zit? - i hate you! that's not my dog. annie, listen to me very carefully. i've seen this before... and buying your first home can be very difficult. there's escrow, inspections... it's a lot of stress. so what you're saying is i've owned a poodle... for five years... and never realized it. i've had clients forget their own names... the year it was, how many children they had. i knew this one guy who, every day for three months... drove back to his old apartment after work. what's that got to do with me? i've got two teenagers. i eat stress for breakfast. which is why i'm not worried about you. then stop looking so worried. i just want you to remember we ran the numbers. you are not in over your head. you got a great deal here. told you buying a model home was the way to go. what are you really trying to say, yasmine? i'm saying... relax. everything is gonna be ok. this is your home. and that... is your dog. what's that? french champagne. talk about optimistic. i'm so sorry it's been such a tough day. i'm sorry if i freaked you out. does that mean i can open up the champagne? down, boy! annie, i just want to say... i know that i was reluctant to move... but i am so glad that you talked me into it. now, if i could talk you into something... just pretend he's not there. i can't. - mom. - hmm? you forgot to buy syrup. you know i hate plain waffles. i'll go shopping today. tess, i made you a special surprise for lunch. - it better be egg salad. - how'd you guess? morning. love you. who... who was that? mom, cut it out. tess... i asked you a question. who is that boy, and what's he doing in our house? mom, come on. first it was czonka, and now it's sean? sean? wh-what are you talking about? that isn't sean. dad! mom's acting weird again! sean! get down here right n... mom? what's wrong? phillip! phillip! phillip! aah! mom! you'll be just fine. just get some rest. we're good here. she's gonna be fine. annie? you gave us quite a scare. what happened? you took a little tumble, but you're gonna be ok. the paramedics said you might have a slight concussion. ohh... sean... tess... where are they? kids, your mom wants to see you. no. no. those are not our children. time for school, you two. you're late enough already. come on. bye, dad. bye, mom. see ya later. sean and tess... annie, sit, sit. phillip! don't you care? our children are missing! listen to me, annie. our kids are on their way to school. i've never seen those two before in my life. don't you know your own children? of course i do! you're confused. no, i'm not! you're the one that's confused! what's wrong with you? what's wrong with everybody? annie, calm down! oh, god! what if it happens to you? - what if you vanish next? - i'm not going anywhere. how can i be sure? i don't want to lose you! you're not going to. ohh... no... no. annie... what's wrong? oh, no, no, no. no... phillip... or whoever you are... just go away! annie, it's me. yasmine. yasmine. is that really you? at least you haven't changed. did you see him? did you see phillip? he called me. he asked me to come speak with you. but did you see him? annie, he's downstairs. and... and he's very concerned about you. and you didn't notice anything different about him? annie, i know this is hard for you to believe... but... phillip is still phillip... just like czonka's still czonka... the kids are still the kids. none of them have changed. oh... - i am not going crazy. - no one says you are. i'm sure there's a perfectly rational explanation. yeah, you're right. there is. i changed them. you lost me. i remember telling phillip i... i wished for the perfect family to go with all of this. and? my wish... it's come true. heh. yasmine, this is not funny! i'm sorry. it's just... you trust me, annie? i want to. then come downstairs with me. why? i want to show you something. look at me, annie. i'm still yasmine, right? i haven't changed. come downstairs. this isn't my furniture. our sofa was ten years old. the stereo. phillip wanted this stereo, but it was $10,000... ok, ok. let's just pretend for a second... that everything you've told me is true... that... that this isn't your furniture... and this isn't your family... and somehow everything's changed. oh, annie, don't you get it? don't you see? any way you look at it... you got what you wanted. honey, you've traded up. so... how's the new school? the campus looks very nice. i love the tennis courts. they have stadium seating and everything. i met my new swim coach today. he won a bronze medal at the '88 olympics. well, it seems like you two are really going to love it here. how's work, dad? well, you know that biotech company that i made an offer on? we closed the deal today. cool! that's great! isn't that great, mom? yes. it's... it's great. so, mom, um, is your head feeling any better? hey, you remember that time that i got beaned in little league? you played little league? i guess i forgot. i think i'll get some more wine. ok. this is what you wanted... the perfect family, the perfect home... ""to the best mom in the world. ""we love you more than you'll ever know. ""tess and sean."" and you love me, too, right? you're a good dog. this is your family now. they love you. they need you. you're gonna have to try to make this work. she's not getting any better, dad. if anything, she's getting worse. i know. what are we gonna do? we have to help her. we're gonna do whatever it takes to make her better. i've already made some calls. will she have to go away? just for a little while. don't worry. i'll be here. honey, is that you? this is yasmine. please leave your name... number, and a brief message. have a great day. yasmine, if you're there, pick up! yasmine, please! i don't know what to do. they're gonna send me away. annie, where are you? oh, god, they're coming. mom? where are you? annie. what are you doing? no! you leave me al-alone. help me, please! ohh... no... no! there you are. are you ok, annie? i was just looking at our picture... thinking how lucky i am. i have a wonderful family... a beautiful new home. it's perfect. just like you. lizzie. dinner. i'll be right there. i just finished upgrading my digital family game. just a game? or is it? how do we know we aren't all just characters... in some computer game called life? and at any moment, each of us could be replaced... by someone a little smarter... a little younger... a little more... perfect?"
1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"i suppose you're wondering what i'm doing here. not much actually. so far i've spent most of my time trying to get out. passersby are not being very helpful. they seem to think i'm an errant actor from the theater of the absurd. actually i was answering a real estate advertisement. small compact residence on thoroughfare. close to schools, shops, freeways. plenty of transportation. ah! running water. and that serves to remind me that tonight's play is called ride the nightmare. and speaking of nightmares, here is our first commercial. well, let me just say, i've got a wife who can get out of there. well, i'm not a big fan of dollar, but i got a wife who can get out of there. hello? hello? hello? hi honey. hello. uh, who's calling, please? just a moment, please. it's for you. well, who is it? i don't know. maybe it's one of my old girlfriends, huh? i doubt it. oh, you don't think i have any, huh? you know, one of these days you're gonna learn to appreciate me. hello. you've made a mistake. my name is martin. look, i said you made a mistake. my name is martin. what? what is it? chris, what is it? he said he was gonna kill me. what? well, that doesn't make sense. what did he say? he was coming here and he was gonna kill me. who? who was that? i don't know. well, chris, that just doesn't make any sense. maybe we should call the police. no. that's probably just some kind of crank. what he thinks is a funny kind of joke or something. that's a pretty weird kind of joke. no, you just can't tell about people like that. i'm gonna call the police. honey. all right, if it'll make you feel better, i'll call them. give me a brandy, would you? would you, uh, give me the police station order? will you send a patrol car to my house right away? i've been threatened. that's right. the man called up on the phone said he was coming over here to kill me. just now. christopher martin, 1204 13th street. that's right. yes, thank you. what did they say? they'll come. when? as soon as they can, helen. what if he was calling from johnson's truck store? well, sweetheart, take it easy. i'm sure it's just what you said. it's probably a crank. helen, block the kitchen door. do you hear me? get the lights. pull the blinds. get the hall light. close the bedroom windows. do like i tell you. check the kitchen door. chris, shouldn't we leave? we could go to bill's house. no, he might already be outside. i'm sorry. you stay here. i thought i told you to stay in the... chris. hold it! turn on the light. you did all right for yourself. she's a winner. i found you, didn't i, phillips? you're making a mistake. can't you see he's not the man you're after? our name is martin. martin, huh? phillips is the name i know by. you thought you could change your name and we wouldn't find you, huh? that's right, baby. we... huh. for a while there, i thought you did get away. and i saw that picture of you in that magazine. you know the one. the picture of you and that bowling king that won the state championship. and i thought to myself, here's a picture of my old friend, chrissy boyd. i just gotta stop in and say hello. you'd better get out of here. my husband has called the police. no. you didn't do that, did you? no. you wouldn't do that, would you, chrissy boyd? because if you called the police, they'd send you to jail. and you don't want to go to jail, do you, chrissy boyd? you did call them, didn't you, chris? you mean you didn't tell her, chris? oh, that was a nice... you should have told her about your wicked past. shut up. don't move! oh, you stuck me, didn't you, baby? well, we'll make up for that, won't we? yeah, that's right, lady. i'm gonna kill him. just like i said i would. only... i'd just like to have heard him a little more first. and i just thought of a way. helen, get the knife! should i call the police? why ask me? you think i enjoyed keeping it from you? why did you then? didn't you think you could trust me? i was afraid to tell you. and i never thought i'd have to. i was sure they wouldn't find me. and that bowling picture had to be taken. that's funny. the secret i've kept for almost 15 years ended in the second i stick in bowling team. it's so funny, it's hilarious. where are you going? to call the police. no! i don't want you to be arrested. you're willing to consider doing something else? what else can we do? helen, if that body wasn't found, nobody would ever know what happened. look, we can take that body up in the hills and bury it. helen, look, it's either that or prison. there's nothing in between. i've lived a decent life ever since it happened. i've done everything i could to make up for it. everything we've had for seven years is going to be thrown away just because of him. i love you. murder! i had nothing to do with it. you hear me, helen? i had nothing to do with the murder. it's bill. chris, you can't... don't worry, i'm not gonna let him in. oh, hello, bill. we're out of ice cubes, mr. martin, and my mother sent me over to borrow some. oh, sure. honey, would you get bill some ice cubes? hi, helen. hello, bill. hope i didn't wake you up, huh? oh, no. i'm glad. go ahead, honey. we never go to bed before in good night. oh, good, chris, good. you having a little party over there, huh? some party. my aunt decided to pay us a surprise visit. well, how long is she gonna be here? too long. well, i don't know when she was coming at all. i had to grab the first plan for rory. can't you get him, honey? ah, hear me help her. no, bill, i'm sorry. - that's all right.  i'll do it. it's only fair. there she is. oh, i sure appreciate this, helen. colder than my old aunt's heart. oh, helen, i hope i didn't disturb you, huh? all right, bill, anytime. thanks a million for ice cubes, helen. you're welcome, chris. yeah, my aunt thanks you, my mother thanks you, and i thank you. and you are welcome, bill. thank you. good night. good night. we'll have to wait until they go to bed. helen, i want to tell you something. it isn't necessary. yes, it is. i know that you think i never told you about it because i was afraid of going to prison. but it's not true. i was afraid for you. you were so young when we married, so unprepared for anything like that. that was seven years ago, chris. i know. it's just that i didn't know how to tell you. as time went by, i began to think that maybe i wouldn't have to. i was only 19 when it happened. i was working for a bank, picking up deposits from all the big stores in the area. this was albuquerque. i was living with my father and my mother died when i was born. well, you know all that. he and i didn't get along, so more to stay out of his way than anything else. i started hanging around some of the bars. that's where i met fred. later on i met steve, adam. those are the other two escaped prisoners. we hung around together. we planned a robbery. we picked one of the bank's depositors. nice old guy who ran a jewelry store. i was supposed to knock on the back door like i always did when i made a collection. they'd go inside, get the money, and i'd wait out in the car. i was supposed to warn them if something happened. something happened, all right. well, the old guy got to the alarm system. next thing i know, i heard a police car coming. and i ran out on them. at the time, i didn't know that they'd kill the old man. i just ran out on them because i didn't have the guts. i drove them away as fast as i could, and when the car ran out of gas, i hitchhiked out of the state, came to los angeles, changed my name, met you. that's it. i'll call the police. if you think you can put him someplace where they won't find him, i'd do it. it's just that i can't bear the thought of never seeing you again, being taken away from you. i won't let them take you away. i won't. it's all right, sweetheart. it's all right. put him out of our lives. honey, why don't you go back to bed? what about those other two men? what about them? what if they should come here? they want it by the law. they won't. wasn't the other one wanted by the law? he was drunk, helen, out of his mind. i've been awake all night. i've been trying to visualize going on as your wife. i can't, chris. all the meaning seems to be gone out of it. it's not the same. it's just not the same. the same people, helen. are we? i don't even know who i am. am i helen martin? am i helen phillips? or am i married at all? i just don't know anything, chris. least of all the men i've been married to for seven years. honey... do you want to leave? hello. hello, chris. what do you want? to see you, boy. you want to meet us or shall we drop by? stay away from me, i mean it. we'll see you at monica and 12th street in 15 minutes. give me the police. (music) honey, i'm going to take the bus to the plant. you can have a car. get in the car. it's been a long time, chris. you look good. i can't say i like that. what do you want? a little charity, that's all. brief money. i know you won't object now that you've killed fred. i wasn't sure you had till now. ah, don't worry. i'm not mourning. he was a bungler. he's too emotional like steve there. if i wasn't along, he'd have put a bullet through your head by now for running out on us. how much? well, we'd like 50 or 100 thousand dollars. but we know you haven't got that much. i've got to have some travel and money so we'll settle for five. i haven't even got five. all right, four. look, we don't leave you in a ditch somewhere. bank's open in one hour. you get that money and meet us at 11 o'clock. you know where latigo canyon is? yeah. i'll bring the money there. we'll find us. you could bring the police, of course. but i don't think you will. not you. indignation, christopher. we'd better make it six. six? oh, shut up. i haven't got that much. you bring what you got, then. better not be less than four. all right. well, that's splendid. that's really splendid. keep in mind, if you fail, you'll be receiving a visit from either us or the police. either one of which won't be very pleasant. i said all right. eleven o'clock, christopher. pull over. helen? helen? helen... helen... you have just witnessed the first half of our play. we now come to that part of the program which one viewer says reminds him of a bologna sandwich, a station break between two slices of hitchcock. good evening, and welcome to the alfred hitchcock hour, again. you have come back a trifle early, but no matter. we have an excellent little time killer which will keep you from getting restless. and now, if you will be good enough to give me a hand, i shall get out of here. oh, good morning, mr. martin. oh, well, mrs. anthony. i saw you standing there, and i wondered if your wife had run across that canopy dish. she said she was going to look in the cupboard for it. she thought she put it there after the garden club meeting last week. i wouldn't fuss about it ordinarily, but i'm giving a little dinner party friday night, and i especially want that dish for canapes. it's priceless, really. my husband bought it in london five, no, six months ago. it's handmade, and, well, will it be all right if i stop by the house then? i'm sorry, mrs. anthony. i didn't hear what you said. i said, do you think your wife would mind if i dropped by the house and helped her look for the dish? oh, well, she's not at home right now. oh, are you feeling ill, mr. martin? oh, no, it's just awful hot in here, isn't it? well, when will she be back? well, i don't know. she's going to santa barbara. oh, well, i would like that dish on friday night, or before, if possible. you see, it's absolutely priceless. mrs. anthony, look, when i finish at the plant, i'll go home. i'll pick up that dish. i'll bring it over to your place tonight. uh-oh. thank you. i'd appreciate it. excuse me, ma'am. i'm in a terrible hurry. would you mind very much if i got in front of you? i've been waiting here longer than you have, young man, and i'm in just as much of a hurry as you are. i'm sorry. please, i'd like it in small bills, please, tens and twenties. yes, sir. and could you make it as fast as possible? hey, where are you going? oh, one moment, sir. that gentleman there. all right, send him over. it's locked. that's great. won't you sit down, mr.martin? uh, look, i'm in an awful hurry, mr. campbell. please. what is it? this withdrawal, mr. martin. it would leave your savings account with less than $100. i know that. well, this note you signed. note? yes. it states that a $4,000 loan was extended to you last october. just a minute. i'm conditioned at a similar amount in your savings account service collateral, so if you withdraw $4,000... mr. campbell, listen, i've been doing business with this bank for nine years now. during that time, i've never failed to meet an obligation. my credit rating is without question. i think we can make the deal. i need this money now. my mother's in financial trouble. see you this afternoon. she requires it immediately, and you'll get the money back as soon as possible. mr. martin, please understand that it's not as if i personally... look, i've got a good job. i pay my bills, i met every obligation of this bank. i need that money now. very well, mr. martin. i see no pressing reason why we can't allow this. it's irregular, but in view of your past credit rating, i think we can put it through. thank you. where is she? i didn't think it was a good idea to stop at the main road. where is she, adam? now, where is she? adam? steve is taking splendid care of her. where? it's all there. well, let's see. all right, dude. let's go. tell me where she is, adam. i said, help me, i'll kill you. oh, you won't. you haven't got the stomach for it. tell me where she is, or i'll blow your stinking head off. don't, don't. that shack is not far from here. did she hurt? i'm sorry. she could not be. go on. climb! quite the little hero, aren't we? there's only two bullets. it'll be the rest of them. what do you think, are we waltzed out of that pen? it's all there is left. you plan on turning us over to the police? you, of course, realize what's going to happen if you do. you go to the pen for the rest of your life. what do you think they're going to do with you, little man? don't worry about me. i plan on living a long, long time with a bet on it. how much further? just beyond that bend away. get out. hold it. what now, little hero? well, you're gonna call him out. anything you say, little hero. you walk up that road about 15 feet and call him. and you better make it good. be careful, there's only two bullets. it only takes one. go on. steve! steve! what happened to you? hold it. helen! helen! chris! i told you there are only two. well, now i've got you, little hero. come on, come on. give me your hand. come on. you've got to, sweetheart, try it. keep your head down. (music) honey, the only thing we can't do is to try and climb out of here. give me your hand. give me your hand. chris! chris! chris! chris! i'm terribly sorry. that was a nasty tumble. however, we did manage to get me out of there. perhaps you can amuse yourself by sitting in the darkness and imagining what our next commercial will be like. sorry, regulations, you know."

""so they keep their word scrupulously. they're unusually honest."" is that what i heard you say in the briefing room, doctor? yes, i mentioned that. he also mentioned that they can be highly dangerous. dangerous if lied to. if their customs are violated. well, we lied to no one, doctor. we violated no customs. perhaps you'll explain to me why one of my men is dead. because he was drawing a weapon on another of their guests. grant looked up, saw a klingon, made a purely instinctive defensive move. what's a klingon doing down here among your scrupulously honest friends anyway? look, jim, i know what it means to you to lose a crewman. that's only one down, doctor. there's over 400 more up there in orbit. and if there's a klingon down here... ...there might be a klingon ship up there somewhere. mr. scott... ...picking up something on the sensors, sir. seems to be another ship. let's put it on the screen. it's just at the edge of our sensor range, sir. hard to get an exact reading. you think it's a klingon ship? who else would be playing cat and mouse with a starship? can't hurt us much out there, bobbing about like that. no need to call the captain yet. bones. yes, captain? i shouldn't have chewed you out. i'm sorry. i understand. inefficient, however. emotion, captain. yes, you're quite right, mr. spock. inefficient... ...and illogical. you've shown friendship by handing over our weapons. and she's making a gesture in return. jim. if you touch it, her nearest male relative will have to try to kill you. they're offering you a chance for combat. they consider it more pleasurable than love. it would appear, captain, that he finds you a disappointment. i am the teer, akaar. i lead the ten tribes of capella. and this is eleen. a young wife, to give an old man a son to rule these tribes. i'm captain kirk. first, i must protest the killing of one of my crewmen. if it was your man, was it not his privilege to die for you? - i do not understand. - their customs are different, teer. and different from those of my people too, teer. the sight of death frightens them. let me take this, jim. what maab has said is true. our customs are different. what the klingon has said is unimportant, and we do not hear his words. i just called the klingon a liar. laughter, teer? is not the klingon an honoured guest also? it is the earth people who first bargained for our rocks. is it not best to have two who bargain for the same goods? - it is i who speak for the tribe, maab. - i speak for many, teer. hear the words of the klingon. what do earthmen offer you? what have you obtained from them in the past? powders and liquids for the sick? we klingons believe as you do. the sick should die. only the strong should live. earthmen have promised to teach the youth of your tribes many things. what? what things? cleverness against enemies? - the use of weapons? - the klingon speaks the truth, akaar. the earth federation offers one other thing, akaar. our laws. and the highest of all our laws states: your world is yours, and will always remain yours. this differs us from the klingons. their empire is made up of conquered worlds. they take what they want by arms and force. good. let the klingons and the earthmen offer us amusement. capellans welcome this. the earthmen have different customs. but never have they lied to our people. there are those of us who will not bargain with earthmen, akaar. do you say you will fight me, maab? let that be your choice, teer. we need our communicators, those devices on our belts. if there's a klingon ship somewhere... the sky does not interest me. i must consider the words i have heard. leave him. the ship's disappeared, sir. gone out of range. mr. scott, i'm getting a call from a vessel. so faint i can't make it out. put a booster on it, lieutenant. try to pull it in. i've lost it. it sounded like a distress signal from an earth vessel. klingon! communicators. weapons. i have no quarrel with you, captain. i wish merely to... ...return to my vessel. type of vessel? location? a small scout ship, captain. we need the mineral too. i was sent to negotiate. release him. akaar is dead. i am the teer. - kill them now. - wait! if you lead these people now, be certain you make the right decisions. is the new leader of the ten tribes afraid? - let me kill them for you. - or let the klingon and me fight. it might amuse you. perhaps to be a teer is to see in new ways. i begin to like you, earthman. and i saw fear in the klingon's eye. we had an agreement. that too, may change, klingon. i have the signal clear now, mr. scott. it is a distress call. it's from the ss dierdre. dierdre. that's a freighter. reporting they're under attack. they're running, trying to manoeuvre. it's a klingon vessel attacking. - helm? - picking it up, sir. taking a fix. try the captain. enterprise to captain kirk. come in, captain. enterprise to captain kirk. come in, captain. captain, careful. - you carry a child who would be teer. - i must die. no! no man may touch the wife of a teer. she was prepared to die, earthman. i was proud to obey the laws. kill him first. he laid hands upon me. it is my right to see him die. enterprise to mr. spock. dr. mccoy, come in please. i have it on the sensors, sir. tie into my channel, lieutenant. tied in. ... commanding. we are under heavy attack by klingon vessels. two convoy ships are already damaged. we must have help. enterprise, acknowledge. please acknowledge. repeat... interception course computed and laid in, sir. prepare to take us out of orbit, mr. sulu. aye, sir. scotty, the captain... we have a distress call from a federation ship under attack. that's where our duty lies. take us out of orbit, mr. sulu. ahead warp 5. captain's log, stardate 3498.9. lieutenant commander scott in temporary command. we were forced to leave capella to come to the aid of a federation vessel under attack by a klingon vessel. we were unable to contact our landing party before we were forced to answer the distress signal. our inability to reach the landing party is strange, and i am concerned. our check-in signal is one hour 12 minutes overdue. since no reconnaissance party has appeared, and since mr. scott is notably efficient in such matters... i must assume that something's keeping them busy up there. the klingon ship. that would seem a logical conclusion. captain... ...l'm gonna fix that woman's arm. they can only kill me once for touching her. that's a very good idea, bones. yes, captain. an excellent idea. let me see that arm. you will not touch me. you said you were prepared to die. does that mean you prefer to die? i think we can get you safely to the ship. your choice. to live is always desirable. all right, let's go. klingon. there is nothing to concern you there. we made an agreement, maab. i have a right to my weapons. we have them well cared for, klingon. your weapon will be returned when our business is completed. that was our agreement. aft phaser, affirmative. we're going to bridge. approaching the freighter's last reported position, sir. sensor report, mr. chekov? negative, sir. no debris, no residual particles. no traces. mr. sulu, begin a standard search pattern. all scanners full intensity, mr. chekov. - no signal at all? - negative, sir. it should be on our screens by now. at best a freighter might travel warp two. i'm well aware of a freighter's maximum speed, mr. sulu. captain's log, stardate 3499.1. before leaving the capellan encampment, we managed to retrieve our communicators. our phasers were not to be found. we have fled into the hills, yet we know the capellans will eventually find us by scent alone, if necessary. and we have learned one thing more. the girl, eleen, hates the unborn child she is carrying. stay with her, bones. nice place to get trapped in. but a defensible entrance, captain. yes, i see. scout up the trail that way. see what we have in the way of an exit. i'll take a look around. now listen, you may be a capellan woman and the widow of a high teer. but i'm a doctor, and it's my tradition to care for the sick and injured. now let me see that arm. - you will not touch me in that manner. - now you listen to me, young woman. i'll touch you in any way or manner that my professional judgement indicates. just as i thought. it can come any time now. how do you know? because i'm a doctor, that's how i know. even the women of our village cannot tell so much with a touch. strange hand. very soft. the walls get higher and narrower, but there is a way out. good. if we could block off that entrance, it'd give us more time. - they'd have to go around these hills. - there's enough loose rock and shale. do you think we could create a sonic disruption with two of our communicators? only a very slight chance it would work. well, if you don't think we can, maybe we shouldn't try. i didn't say that exactly. sound beams should produce a sympathetic vibration... ...on the weak area of that slide. worried about the delivery? capellans aren't human, jim. they're humanoid. there are certain internal differences. i don't have the equipment to handle an emergency. - if you don't think you can handle it... - forget it. i can do it. the last thing i want around is a ham-handed ship's captain. no! only mccoy. there's a cave in there. probably the only shelter around here. i'll need help getting her in there. no! look, i'm a doctor, not an escalator. spock! give me a hand! i will allow only your touch. a vessel doesn't just disappear. there's nothing, mr. scott. all channels and frequencies are clear. mr. chekov? nothing, sir. if it were destroyed, i'd pick up debris readings of some sort. it couldn't have run away from us, sir. not a freighter. mr. chekov, pull the microtape on that distress call. i want it replayed. ... commanding. we are under heavy attack by klingon vessels. two convoy ships are already damaged. we must have help! enterprise, acknowledge. - please acknowledge. - did you hear it? they called us by name. not a general distress signal, but one aimed right at us. wouldn't they normally call for the nearest starship? how would a freighter know we were ordered into this sector? trap. we were diverted from the planet. or it could be an authentic distress call. we'll stay long enough to make certain. - continue search pattern. - yes, sir. continuing. bones? you've got one of those magnesite-nitron tablets in your kit. - give me one. - just a minute. let me get her on the rock. pain is here. how did you arrange to touch her, bones? give her a happy pill? no. right cross. - never seen that in a medical book. - it's in mine from now on. no, it's there. pain is there. vegetation, captain. evidently there's water nearby. good. but we need weapons just as much as we need water, spock. there would seem to be little weapon potential at hand. follow me. mccoy! easy. i'm here. you must want the child. no. here child belongs to husband. so they take all the credit here. poppycock! answer me. do you want my help? answer me. do you want my help? all right. say to yourself, ""the child is mine. the child is mine. it is mine."" yes. it's yours. no. you've got it all wrong. yes, mccoy. it's yours. no. say to yourself, ""the child is mine. it is mine. it is..."" kirk to enterprise. come in. kirk to enterprise. come in. fortunately this bark has suitable tensile cohesion. you mean it makes a good bow string? i believe i said that. that's more like it. since the capellans never developed the bow, this may come as big a surprise as gunpowder was on earth. no, mr. spock. that isn't the way. you place this arm under here to support its back, and this hand here, to support its head. i would rather not, thank you. mccoy. bring our child. ""our"" child? - i'll explain later. - that should prove very interesting. still negative, mr. scott. all sweeps. - mr. chekov? - nothing. - we're turning back. warp five, helm. - warp five, sir. on course for capella iv. warp 6 as soon as she'll take it, mr. sulu. the captain could be in trouble back there. mr. scott. another distress call from the uss carolina. ignore it. mr. scott, the carolina is registered in this sector. ignore it, lieutenant. log it as my order, my responsibility. aye, aye, sir. scotty, if it should turn out to be real... there's an old, old saying on earth, mr. sulu: ""fool me once, shame on you. fool me twice, shame on me."" i know this saying. it was invented in russia. jim! spock! jim! spock! what happened, bones? my patient spattered me with a rock. she's gone. - the child? - it's all right. it's in there. i guess i'll forget psychiatry, stick with surgery. - i really thought she'd learn to want it. - virtue is a relative term, doctor. - she'll head straight to the warriors. - i'll go with you. you took a medical oath long before you signed aboard my ship. that small patient in there needs you. - estimating the planet? - thirty-one minutes, sir. scanner to bridge. read. engineering control. mr. scott. sensors picking up a vessel ahead. cutting across our path. - sub-light, one half. - reversing to sub-light. one half. it's an alien, sir. by configuration, a klingon warship. taking position directly in our path. - mr. sulu, sound battle stations. - aye, aye, sir. this is the uss enterprise calling unidentified klingon vessel. come in. uss enterprise calling klingon vessel. acknowledge, please. i have it on the viewscreen now, sir. still distant. holding a position dead ahead, sir. drawing a line, daring us to step over it. still closing. the alien is directly in our line of flight. this is the commander of the uss enterprise. identify yourself and your intention. acknowledge. close out the frequency, lieutenant. phaser banks are ready, sir. and we'll go right down their throat, if necessary. let's see if they have the belly for it. behind the rocks up there. the earthmen make excellent game. their cleverness has surprised me. they must die. that is your law. we will honour our law and our word to you, klingon. maab. the child is dead, maab. do as you will with me. the earthmen? dead. i killed them as they slept. if true, take us to them. do you doubt my word, klingon? i am the wife of a teer. i will die in my own tent. it is in order. she is the wife of a teer. no! first we verify her story! is this what your sworn word means, klingon? spock? here, captain. over here, captain. spock to enterprise. the cavalry doesn't come over the hill in the nick of time any more. if by that you mean we can't expect help from the enterprise, i must agree. there's just one thing i want. the klingon? one of us must get him. revenge, captain? why not? the next man who raises a weapon destroys all of you. you and your primitive knives and your weapons! i'll teach you what killing really means. klingon! fight! are you warriors or children? maab. i will flee. when the klingon turns to fire, i'll... as teer of the ten tribes, i give you back your life. mine is now forfeit. keel, stand ready. klingon! hold it there! drop your weapons! we missed you, mr. scott. we had a wee bit of a run-in with a klingon vessel but he had no stomach for fighting. we checked the encampment, found out you were here and had no trouble at all in tracking you down. i could... no, that's not the way to handle it. here, like this. here, take its little head like that. there. arm under, that's it. see how easy? ""oochy-woochy-kootchy-coo,"" captain? an obscure earth dialect, mr. spock. if you're curious, consult linguistics. at any rate, this should prove interesting. interesting? when the woman starts explaining how the new high teer is actually dr. mccoy's child. what's that again, mr. spock? we don't actually understand it ourselves, mr. scott. nor does dr. mccoy. contact starfleet. inform them that federation mining rights on capella have been secured by treaty. documents signed by the young high chief's regent. - report follows. - aye, aye, sir. - the child's regent? - yes. eleen. a remarkable young lady. representing the high teer, leonard james akaar. the child was named leonard james akaar? has a kind of a ring to it, don't you think, james? i think it's a name destined to go down in galactic history, leonard. - what do you think, spock? - i think you're both gonna be insufferably pleased with yourselves for at least a month, sir. take us out of orbit, mr. sulu. ahead, warp factor one."

my grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf? ? so it stood 90 years on the floor? ? it was taller by half than the old man himself? ? though it weighed not a pennyweight more? such a long face. ? my grandfather said? honey. ? that of those he could hire? ? not a servant so faithful he'd found? ? for it wasted no time...? what's wrong? i have to go up to talk to him. i don't know what to say to him. he's so happy, singing. honey, i know how much you love him, and i love you, but we have to face facts. i know. you're good for me. someone's got to take care of the homely women of the world. hmm, thanks loads. ? 90 years without slumbering? ? ticktock, ticktock? ? with life's seconds numbering? ? ticktock, ticktock...? good, that, uh, that... grandpa? come on down. oh, marnie. don't waste your eyesight, grandpa. well, you know, once a clockmaker... and it's been a few minutes off lately. grandpa, are you all right? me? why, never better. why, marn? well, it's just that you didn't come down for dinner. in fact, you haven't been out of your room all day. well, my friend's been acting up today. i can't seem to get it regulated just right, you know. grandpa, we know how you love the clock. i... but-but you see, it's ticking along nicely now. we shouldn't have any trouble for a long while. of course, with a clock as old as that, well, you-you're bound to run into problems, you know. just like old people. oh, oh, oh. now you ignore that. just ignore the clock and ignore me. the main thing is really you and the baby, you see. that's more important than... will you get some rest? take care of yourself. oh, you know me. l-i never sleep. at least eat. well, maybe later. promise? promise. okay. oh, it's... it's running slow. i didn't wind it properly. they're making me so nervous. i'm becoming careless. i mustn't... i mustn't let them make me nervous. please, please, don't stop. i'll never forget to wind you again. i promise. each man measures his time- some with hope, some with joy, some with fear. but sam forstmann measures his allotted time by a grandfather's clock, a unique mechanism whose pendulum swings between life and death, a very special clock that keeps a special kind of time... in the twilight zone. where is he this morning? still sleeping, i guess. i'm not surprised. he must have been fiddling around with that clock till 4:00 in the morning. did you hear him? sit down. will you please sit down, honey? is that all you're having? i'm not hungry. what about the baby? i'm sure you don't have to worry, doug. honey, now, let's not start fighting again. but you have to face the fact your grandfather's just not a well man. he's always been so alert, so easy to be with. maybe it's just a temporary thing. maybe it's a little something we don't know anything about. why don't we let mel avery talk to him, just to make sure. you think i'm crazy, don't you? mel avery is a psychiatrist. he's a head shrinker. you don't have to tell me, i know. grandpa, mel's been a friend of ours for years. he and doug went to college together. you've met him. i've met lots of people. but i don't let them tinker with my head. sam, no one's going to tinker with your head. all we're suggesting is that you see mel and talk to him. well, why do i need to see a psychiatrist? well, your preoccupation with the clock, for instance. i'm fond of my clock and that makes me crazy. my, what a strange world we live in. you have to admit you spend a lot of time with it. sometimes half the night. aha! just because i have insomnia and working on the clock relaxes me, that makes me a candidate for the loony bin. i've had insomnia all my life. so did my father. he died at 90. 90 years without slumbering- just like the song says. grandpa, doug only has your best interest at heart. yeah, my best interests. all right, son. i'll see your friend the psychiatrist tomorrow. you may be surprised when you find out who the crazy one really is. that clock was completed exactly 76 years ago. and it was presented to me the day of my birth. you see, doctor, my father was very much in love with my mother. and in those days, it was very fashionable for husbands and wives to be in love with each other. and it's no longer fashionable, huh? if it were, the woods wouldn't be full of psychiatrists. so you and the clock were ""born"" on the same day so to speak. oh, now, you're trying to get me to say that i think that the clock is a real, living person. well, i don't. it's a mechanism. nothing more, nothing less. then why be so extraordinarily concerned with it? well, that clock's worth hundreds of dollars. it also is a family heirloom. wouldn't you want to keep a thing like that in perfect condition? well, yes, but, uh... you're not sure, huh? yes, i'm sure. but we're not talking about my clock, we're talking about your clock. oh, so you have a grandfather's clock, too, doctor, huh? as a matter of fact, my wife bought one recently. she collects antiques. tell me about it. well, it's eight feet tall, hand-carved, built in germany in 1874 by, uh... uh... mr. forstmann, we were talking about you. oh, i thought we were talking about your clock. yes, we were, but we somehow got off the track. track? are we going to talk about trains now? mr. forstmann, if you don't care to talk about anything else... oh, i could talk about clocks for hours, doctor. but your time's expensive. mine's free. oh, there, uh, there is one thing, doctor. yes? when my clock stops ticking, i'll die. you really believe that? oh, there's no doubt about it. does that make me crazy? well, crazy is a big word. but it is a rather strange idea. if i had a clock like that i'd get rid of it. oh, either the clock goes or i go. that's what you're telling me. i didn't say that. i think you did. good day, doctor. be careful, boy. be careful. don't worry, pops, we got it. right there. well, what do you think? i don't know, pops. i'm not an interior decorator. hey, wait. what happened? my clock! now, look, pops. take it easy. oh, i'm all right. boy... you had us worried for a minute. not yet, i guess. not yet. doug, look. oh, no, honey... he's trying to make some compromise with us, doug. well, children. hello, grandpa. i thought we'd give it a try there. to see how it looks. what do you think? i don't know. sam, take a look for yourself. it sticks out like a sore thumb. yeah, i guess it does. sam, we might as well be honest. the doctor says the clock should go. the doctor said that? he says you're being obsessed by the clock. he says it's bad for you. senile- that's what he really said, isn't it? no, grandpa. and he wants you to put me away. no, grandpa, he didn't say that. well, i'm not going to any loony bin. i'll tell you what i am going to do. i'm going to sell the clock. i love this clock and your nursery is beautiful. marnie, it's just perfect. thank you. do you want some more coffee? we can talk a little bit. love it. you know, i refuse to get pregnant until i have my nursery all planned. george didn't think that was logical. i have to agree with him, carol. mr. forstmann, where will you be living after the baby comes? carol, he'll be staying right here in his own room. oh, well, of course, i didn't mean anything. i'll be needing his help. you going to keep the clock here? just temporarily. carol, do you know anyone who might like to buy it? sure, me. i wish i could afford it. do you mean that? do i? you know what i think about antiques and that clock will just make our hallway. oh, well, i think that we can work out something. i mean, you could pay me later. it doesn't matter. are you serious, mr. forstmann? yes. it would be perfect. you living next door to us i could visit the clock every day. i mean, i could take care of it. keep it in good condition. and we'd appreciate it. it's not one of your eight-day clocks. it's special. you have to wind it every other day. grandpa... i don't think carol would like you tinkering with it. it'll be her clock. but it would only take a few minutes every other day. oh, i wouldn't mind, marnie, and he could take good care of it. i'd appreciate it, really. it's up to you two, anyway. i can't wait to see what it looks like. george doesn't think i'm a bargain hunter. wait till he hears about this. good morning, marnie. good morning, grandpa. you're up early this morning. well, early to bed, early to rise- you know, ben franklin? or was it george washington? i'm off to wind the clock. george and carol are out of town. didn't you know that? out of town? just for the weekend. you'll hardly miss a visit to your clock. don't you realize that the clock winds down after 48 hours? grandpa, are you going to start that again? we've all been so happy for the past two weeks. all of us. yes, yes, we've been happy. two weeks of borrowed time. i should be grateful. it's running out. it's dying. hold it right there. look, officer, i have to wind the clock, you know, it's running down. it must be wound, it must be. oh, sure, sure, mister. where do you live? i live next door there. but you don't understand- i have to wind the clock. come on, come on. you'll wake the whole neighborhood. look, please, just let me wind the clock, and then i'll go home. that's private property. i can't let you go in there. you have to! now, look, mister, i can't let you go in there. don't you see? don't you see, i'm running down. and if that stops, i'll die. i'll really die. oh, i don't think so. you mustn't do this, you mustn't. just let me wind the clock, please. can i get something for you, grandpa? i won't need anything. don't worry, marnie, it's, it's better this way. better? good night, grandpa. good night, sweetheart. it is... it is better this way. it has to come sometime. and i want it to come for me here. sam, old friend... it's been a good life. but now it's time to go. well, don't let me detain you. how the heck did you get in my bedroom? i don't believe we've been introduced. your face is familiar. i'm your spirit. your time has come, sam. after all, you are 76. don't give me that spirit of 76 stuff. and who says it's my time to go? have you forgotten what your father told you? and your grandfather? about what? didn't they always tell you that when the clock winds down you'll die? yes, and you know something? i used to believe that stuff. you should have. they told you often enough. but that's silly. don't you know that? i do. i've been to a psychiatrist. so what? so he told me he didn't think i needed the clock. and he didn't think i was crazy. and you know what? he was right and we're wrong. you know, personally, i never trust the psychiatrists. well, you're from another generation. see, i live in the present. live, i said. look at me. you're just a figment of my imagination. why, i can see right through you. i've got a great-grandchild coming. and i plan to stay around a while to play with him to, uh, watch him grow, take him to school. maybe even to college. i repeat, i don't believe in you, therefore you don't exist, right? right. marnie. what are you doing up this time of the night? i was worried about you, grandpa. the thing to worry about is that great-grandchild of mine. now, you let me up, let me out of this bed. my goodness, you shouldn't worry about me. come on downstairs and i'll get you a good cup of hot chocolate. be careful of the steps. must be careful. it's my great-grandchild. look out. marnie? i think i cheated your friend. that old clock hasn't been running right for the last 40 years. why, it's taken everything i ever learned in clockmaking just to keep it going. really, grandpa? uh, as a matter of fact, it stopped ticking for the last time just a few moments ago. how do you know that? don't ask me how i know but i know. and a strange thing happened, marnie. when that clock died, i was born again. clocks are made by men, god creates time. no man can prolong his allotted hours, he can only live them to the fullest- in this world or in the twilight zone. and now, mr. serling. next time we enlist the aid of a very talented scribe, earl hamner, jr. he's written a story called ""ring-a-ding girl"" and in the milieu of fantasy, this one is strictly a blue ribbon entry. it stars maggie mcnamara and it involves a movie actress, a publicity tour, a strange flight, an airplane, and some occult occurrences designed to send shivers through you like a fast subway train. next time out on the twilight zone, ""ring-a-ding girl."""

you could have saved a robot, but instead, you saved a human. do you think human life is more precious than robot life? no, no. well, yes, actually. that's it. i'm killing myself. oh, lord. don't try to talk me out of it! well? bender, you always say you're going to kill yourself, but you almost never do. yeah. last time you went to the suicide booth, you ended up dating it for six months. how is lynn, by the way? living in oregon with her crazy mother. see you at my funeral, suckers! kill me, please, and make it splatter! with pleasure, bender. lynn? huh. wow, you look great. fat, but great. i thought you were in oregon. my mom tried to commit suicide in me. i don't want to talk about it. well, tell your mom i said ""hello,"" and it's been nice catching up with you. let's get this show on the road. oh, no. you're going to die, all right, but it won't be suicide. it'ii be murder. missed me! he did it! he actually did it this time. no way, mon. he's faking it. he really is gone! everyone, put on your taking-off caps. our what? it's a sign of respect, you savage! poor, nasty, mean old bender. i can't believe we'll never hear his evil laugh again. i miss him so much. there, there, fry. he may be gone, but he'll always be with us as a trash can. look at that loser getting garbage dumped in him. glad i'm not him, whoever he is. fry, as his only friend, you should have first pick of body parts. just don't pick his nose! ha, ha, ha, ha. what's wrong with you guys? this is comedy gold. he always had my back. so i'll take his arm. as a back-scratcher. i love you, bender! somebody hand me a bolt cutter. hey, dip-schlitz, that's not me. i'm right here. hello? pay attention to me! why can't anybody hear my witty remarks? this is hell. you wish. robot devil? you can hear me? why is everyone else ignoring me? isn't it obvious, bender? yeah, i guess it is. you're dead! what? i thought i just had laryngitis and antigravity. come down to my office and i'll explain everything. so what's happening to me? and i'll take my answer in any form but a song. oh, you're no fun. you see, bender, it's simple. you're a ghost. a ghost? no, just the regular kind. because you killed yourself, you're in limbo. your software was exported to the computational cloud. adoy. wait. adoy? your disembodied program is now running on the wireless network shared by all machinery. cut to the chase, smokey. how do i get out of limbo? that's the laughy part. you can't! you're stuck in an infinite loop. an infinite loop? i don't have time for that! man, this is all fry's fault. fry? i hate that guy. we once traded hands. they still stink of candy corn. get this. that jerk said human life was more valuable than robot life. what? after all you've done for him? fry must die! i know, right? i'd murder him good, if only i was still alive. hmm... bender, would you like to make a deal? i'm not stupid. so, yes, absolutely. what have i agreed to? i'll return you to your body after you use your ghostly powers to scare fry to death. that sounds fair and also fun. i like that there's no catch this time. but, wait. there's a catch. crap! if you fail, you'll spend eternity here in robot hell. which, as luck would have it, is where i rehearse my band. hit it, boys! cigars are evil, you won't miss 'em... okay, i'll do it, i'll do it! just stop the damn music! scare fry to death? ha! i could do that in my sleep. whoo! whoo-oo-oo-oo! what are you? deaf? whoo! whoo! hmm. soap. i know fry's afraid of that. maybe he'll die if i rub him all over with it, real slow. whoa, sick! my software can control electronics! what the... no! not the armpits! winter's coming! as you can see, since bender's death, requests to bite one's shiny metal ass are down 98%. do you mind doing that later? bite my shiny metal ass. help! i was attacked in my bathroom! by my bathroom! i'm being haunted by a ghost! fry, you're just upset because you drove bender to suicide. here. take your mind off it with these soothing relaxation balls. all right. i got him all heebie-jeebied with my bathroom of horrors. one more good scare, and i'll be out of limbo. ooh. did someone say limbo? no. nothing. hold onto your dookie. it's about to get spooky! i'm telling you, something supernatural is happening. i'm scared to death! stop being ridiculous. there's no such thing as whatever you're saying. ow, ow, ow! whoa, maybe you're right. i only meant to slap you twice. all i know is i've got a ghost that needs busting. who you gonna call? gho... the number you have dialed has been lame since 1989. now do you believe me? oh, fuff, enough of your superstitious nonsense. i'm sure that whatever is happening can be explained by science. let the seance begin. i said science! the veil is lifting. i am gazing into the spirit world, and nothing. you said something about a buffet? i'm right here, you lazy shyster. wait, i'm sensing something. i'm rich. ow! is it a ghost? there's no such thing as ghosts, you donkey-monkey. it's a robot ghost. a robot ghost? what robot would want to haunt me? me, dumbass. bender, bender, bender, bender! ah, tell him, you baggy old crone. finally. any more ridiculous ideas? hallelujah. i'm here to conduct the exorcism and avail myself of the buffet. can i get an amen and a goodly helping of scruffy's famous corn biscuits? right away, reverend. oh, lord. i got the too-much-macaroni sweats. now, where is this alleged apparition? might be a problem with your circuit breaker. see you. please, i'm under constant attack by machinery. i can't sleep, i can't think, i can't even think. very well. this sacramental firewall scans for and removes ghostware in a 20 foot radius. bring it on, holy man. carry this at all times and the demon cannot harm you. it also keeps cats off the sofa by killing 'em. ah. so quiet, so peaceful. time to lower my guard even for a minute. ow! heart attack. yep, i was right. okay, beelzy, fry's dead. a ghost! oh, it's you. a deal's a deal, so give me my body back. fry's dead, you say? funny, that's not what it says on his wikipedia page. survived a heart attack? damn you, obama-care! i'm afraid your heart has suffered a lot of damage, mr. fry, and my cleavage isn't helping. not helping him. one more sudden shock will kill you. sudden? that's just the kind of one more shock i was planning. the machines, they're after me. you're suffering from machine phobia. your only hope is to go to the amish home world, where no machines are allowed. i guess it's for the best. whoo... the only machine i'll ever miss is bender. say what? now that he's gone, i realize how valuable a robot life can be, when it belongs to my best friend. that's the closest thing to ""bender is great"" that anyone besides me has ever said. final boarding call for flight 38 to the amish home world. as a reminder, passengers are limited to two carry-on butter churns. i'm sorry, fry, i'm sorry. wait for your ghost-buddy. brother fry, thou hast visltors. hi, fry. hello. hey, how have you been? well, yank my beard. this be a surprise. how are you, fry? thank you for asking, english. my life is simple but plain, and though bender be gone, somehow i feel he's still with me. i sure am, brother fry. yo, big bonnet, move your ugly but modest head covering. ah, right, you can't hear me. oh, i hear you loud and clear. you're not granny hester. what have you done with granny hester? she's naked but unharmed. and now, bender, it's time to fulfill your end of the deal. sorry, i'm not going to kill fry. take me to hell for all eternity, just as long as my little bearded meat bag gets to live. that he will not, for you see, it is your fate to kill him. says you. i would never kill fry, not even to save my own life. but, bender, isn't a robot life worth ever so much more than a human life? of course not. what idiot thinks that? you. you're using my own words against me. go to hell! soon enough, but first, the killing. have you noticed that animals are sometimes spooked by robot ghosts? so what? i hate animals. run for your life, fry! move your ham flaps! he can't hear you, bender. i'm afraid your friend is about to be fully buckminstered! oh, yeah? i'll just jump into a machine and get his attention that way. ah! but there aren't any machines on this planet. there's one, you rusty old dummy. hey, no fair. ocupado. got you. ow! ow! come here, devil. what are you doing? and scruffy's buffet, how's that going? fry, fry, look out for that bowling barn. bender, is that thou? i love you. oh, my god. did you see that? are you okay? what just happened? uh. well, i think the robot devil said he loved me in bender's voice wearing granny hester's clothes. i want to go home. you still lose, bender. you failed to kill fry, so you're banished to hell. i get a new body, and you get to be a translucent chump till the end of time. big deal. i saved my friend. as far as i'm concerned, i won. oh, really? you may find your victory pyrrhic when subjected to this lyric for a trillion years or so yeah. hey, where are you going? i don't know and i don't care. yay, i'm back. wait, this is my stop. oh. this guy. bender, for your selfless act in saving fry, i am pleased to welcome you to robot heaven. shut up, god! beg pardon? i want to go back to robot earth. i mean regular earth. hey, stop that. i command you, you jerk. just get out. whoa! whoo. i've been through the adventure of a lifetime. ow! i'm back, baby. you're back from the dead? i'm back from lots of stuff. oh, bender, bender, i missed you so much. hey, wait, did you haunt me? english - us - psdh"
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"good evening, ladies and gentlemen. i have only myself to blame for this embarrassment. i insisted that every phase of our organization should be run on a business-like basis. of course, one bright employee thought it would be appropriate to put the entire program in the dead file. we put him there, instead. but i see that we have something for you which is marked ""immediate attention."" so, i think we should show it to you now. please... please, please... all right, mrs. phillips, dr. tebaldi can make it on thursday next. you're very welcome. goodbye. good morning. may i help you? i'd like to see dr. tebaldi. did you have an appointment, mr... the name's cavender. yes, i've got an appointment. dr. steers called about me yesterday. oh, yes, mr. cavender. one moment, please. mr. charles cavender is here, doctor. yes, sir. you can go right in, mr. cavender. leave your coat here, if you like. thank you. my, we're certainly getting some cold weather, lately, aren't we? yes. come in, mr. cavender. please sit down. dr. steers and i went to school together, did he tell you that? only he elected to become a gp and i went on to psychiatry. is he your regular physician? i've only seen him a couple of times. he didn't tell me what your problem was. only that he thought i could help you more than he could. well, he meant by that, of course, that he doesn't feel your problem is organic. what is your problem, mr. cavender? insomnia. how's that? insomnia. i can't sleep. i haven't slept in months. well, lots of people claim that. say they never sleep. not for a minute. well, it's not really true, of course, you know. it only seems that way. well i... i know that i doze off from time to time. but it's... maybe an hour or two hours. it's certainly not enough. i can't think straight. i'm tired all the time. i've lost three jobs in the past eight months. i see. well, let's get some of the details out of the way first, shall we? and then we'll talk about it. your full name? charles morton cavender. age? thirty-five. occupation? well, i used to work in a steamship company, in the statistical department. i'm working for a mail order outfit now. are you married? single. uh... i should say widowed. your wife died young, mr. cavender? an accident. what sort of accident? does it matter? well, it might. it was a fire. i don't know how often i've had the dream. four, five times maybe... and it's always the same? always. everything's like it was a year ago. we're living in the old house on grassy heights, linda and me. i'm in the living room, sitting on the couch. not doing anything in particular, i'm just sitting there. i can see every stick of furniture in the room. the cherry mahogany breakfront, the white, fuzzy rug that always messed up my trouser cuffs. linda is upstairs in the bedroom. so, i get up and i go to the foot of the stairs, and i call her. she comes out in that kind of gypsy skirt of hers, stands there at the head of the stairs, smiling, with her hand on the banister. then from behind her, i see the flames. she doesn't seem to be aware of them, she just... they come at her from bedroom, she just stands there smiling. i yell at her, i scream until my throat's dry and i can't yell anymore. then the flames grab her, and pull her back. i can hear them roaring, crackling... is that the end of the dream? yes. that's the way the dream is. of course, that isn't the way it had really happened. well, how did it really happen? well, it was... it was in the middle of the night. and linda and i were both asleep. i don't know how the fire actually started. i had some paints and things in a workshop in the basement. and the fire inspector said something about combustion, but i don't know. all i know is that neither of us woke up until the whole room was blazing. it was so full of smoke that i couldn't see anything. i called linda's name, and she didn't answer. i went to the bedroom door, and i couldn't get it open. the knob was so hot. i couldn't get it open so i went to the bathroom door, it was half open. i went inside. i was hysterical, i guess, that's... that's the word for it. i... i started working on the window. it came open and i... i jumped out. it wasn't a very big drop. there were some bushes there that broke my fall. when i hit the ground, i got up, i started running. i didn't stop till i was about halfway to the road. i looked back, the whole house was just covered with flames. it was an old house, wood-framed. i've never seen anything burn so fast. your wife was killed? do you think you could have saved her? i mean, does it trouble you that you didn't try? do you feel guilty, mr. cavender? no. well, it wouldn't be unnatural if you did. even if you had done the only sensible thing. even if there wasn't a chance that you couldn't have saved your wife. it's inevitable that you should feel some guilt. after all, you're still alive. no, it's not that. i don't blame myself. i don't blame myself. well, perhaps not consciously. well, consciously or unconsciously. no matter what. no matter what? what do you mean by that, mr. cavender? well, this... this brother of hers. this jack fletcher... your wife's brother? yeah, now there's a guy you ought to see, doc. he needs a head-shrinker a lot more than i do. why do you say that? because he's crazy, that's why. he's got this nutty idea in his head and he can't get rid of it. what idea is that? does he hold you responsible for his sister's death? yeah. do you know why? now, why should i know? i don't even know the guy, never even met him. he was 500 miles away when it happened. the way he talks, you'd think he was right next door. well, where was he? he was in a veteran's hospital, over in maryland someplace. he heard about linda's death, naturally, and he got some newspaper clippings about the fire. and i suppose that's how he got this idea about me. what idea is that, mr. cavender? well, i saved my own skin. i let linda burn. that's what he thinks. that's what he wrote in the letter. it's a real psychotic letter, doc, you'd be interested in it. where is this man fletcher now, do you know? i don't know. said in his letter he was leaving the hospital. said he was getting out at the right time. the right time? what did he mean by that? how should i know? i supposed he wants to make trouble. look, the guy's half out of his head. he was very fond of his sister, they grew up together without parents. you know what i mean. well, i don't blame him for being upset, except he's wrong, he's absolutely wrong. i couldn't have saved linda, not in a million years. he wasn't in that room, doc, he doesn't know what it was like! it was a furnace in there, it was an absolute furnace! for all i know, linda was already dead when i woke up. there wasn't a chance in the world! you don't have to persuade me, mr. cavender. well, i... i know that it's... it's all connected up, somehow. i know that. the insomnia and the fire. except i slept all right after the fire, that's the thing that bothers me. i slept all right after the fire! well, just when did your insomnia begin, mr. cavender? when jack fletcher left the hospital? yeah. come to think of it, yeah. hello. charlie cavender? who is this? it's jack fletcher, charlie. i hope i didn't wake you up, buddy, but i just got into town. fletcher? couldn't wait to call you, charlie. you understand? i had to tell you i was here. you know why, don't you, buddy? now, listen, fletcher... you know why, charlie. can you hold it a minute, charlie? just a minute, mr. turney, i'm trying to get these... oh, don't bother. that can wait. well, you wouldn't want me to lose track... you've already lost track. this is what i got back from accounting this morning. you know how much it's worth? i'm sorry, mr. turney. i could have sworn they were all right. must be this sickness of mine. what kind of sickness is this, charlie? you don't hit the bottle, do you? no, no! it's nothing like that. it's insomnia. it's a bad case of insomnia. i'm being treated by a doctor. look, charlie, it's not like we didn't give you a chance. i mean, one or two mistakes, that we can afford. but you know what kind of a business this is. we've got a small profit margin here. mistakes cost too much. well, it won't happen again. no, you're right, charlie. i'm sorry, but the front office told me to give you notice. you have a check waiting at the cashier's. look, sir, you can't do that. you can't fire a person for being sick... look, charlie, this is no way to talk in a business office. no way at all. now you pick up your check from the cashier before noon. and leave your desk the way it is. we'll clear it all up later. hello, i'd like to call dover veteran's hospital, dover, maryland. uh... no, i don't know the number. my number? schuyler 4-9970. yes, yes, i'll speak to anyone. hello, uh... yes, i'm trying to find the forwarding address of a recently discharged patient. his name is jack... no, it would be john, i guess. john fletcher. well, i don't know for sure. i know that it's been within the past two months. yes. yes, i'll... it's very important that i find him. i'll hang on. yes? 3-3-1, stanton. manhattan. thank you. thank you very much. who is it? well? what do you want? are you jack fletcher? that's right, buddy. who are you? i'm charlie cavender. linda's husband. come on, let me in! i wanna talk to you. how did you find me? how did you know where i was? i thought we ought to talk this over. i called the veteran's hospital and got your address. clever boy, only you're wasting your time. now, look, jack... i got nothing to say to you! there's no sense in acting like a couple of kids. best thing for us to do is just to lay our cards on the table. flake off. i don't want any friendly chats with you. that's no way to talk. you sure sounded big on the telephone the other night. of course, i'm... i'm willing to forget all about that. i see you had it pretty bad in the war. linda never told me how bad. don't worry about me, buddy. you worry about yourself. you must have been pretty rough. i was in the air force, world war ii, myself. bully for you. any decorations for bravery? cut it out. i know what you feel about the fire. you never gave me a chance to tell you my side. i know your side. you were looking out for number one. i would have saved linda if i could! don't you think i loved her? your type doesn't love anybody. i did the only sensible thing! so, that's why you had to come here, huh? because you're so sensible! you thought you could explain yourself to me, never have another bad dream. that's not true. you thought i would forgive and forget, huh? makes everything okay again? well, you were wrong, buddy. you were dead wrong. because i'm gonna be your bad dream. from now on. you're crazy. i'm appointing myself to the job. you understand? your official nightmare! you'll never be rid of me, cavender, never! you'd like to kill me, wouldn't you? yeah! i'd like to kill you! you'd like to see me dead. i'd like to get my hands around your throat. only you can't. isn't that right, fletcher? a man like you. you think i need legs? you think i need legs to get you, you crumb? and to think how i sweated about you. how many sleepless nights you gave me. you're right, fletcher. you're nothing but a bad dream. that's all you can ever be, is a bad dream. cavender. here's my legs. i'll show you the kind of man i am. looks like everything is pretty well under control, frank. i don't think we'll need that extra crew. good. you call o'brien and tell him. how about the casualties? you get a report yet? only one fatality so far. everybody else got warned out in time. they're bringing him out now. name's cavender, apartment 2-b. the fire started in his place. we think it was a faulty heater. when are people gonna learn about these old heaters? you just can't leave 'em burning when you go to bed. you'd think all the noise would have woke him up. sure must have been a heavy sleeper, that one. you must have heard months ago, that certain things in our land were considered in and others out. it has taken me all this time to comprehend just what all this meant. now, to my dismay, i'm told that the whole subject is no longer in. in other words, if you understand in and out, you are now out. as for those of you who haven't the slightest idea what i'm talking about, you can find consolation in the fact that this makes you in. i think there's very little i can say at this juncture. but i must say that i am disturbed by the unabashed glee with which my assistants bruted me into this. next time we shall return with business very much as usual. until then, good night."
1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"good evening. tonight's play is entitled, ""nightmare in 4-d."" it will be presented in only two dimensions, however. we could present it in 3-d. in fact, we did in america, but the viewers kept getting involved and during one of the more violent scenes, we wouldn't want that to happen here. in this case, 4-d indicates the number of an apartment. and ""nightmare in 4-d"" concerns the goings-on the goings-on will begin going on in just a moment. oh, darn! hold it! hold it! i got it. all right. all right. oh, thank you. thank you, mr. parker. you're a lifesaver. give me that one. no, no, i can manage this one. oh, that's much too heavy for you. well, let me get the elevator. no, no, i'll get that, too. i don't know how you do it. oh, it's nothing for an old cliff dweller. say, miss elliott, i haven't seen you around lately. well, didn't i tell you? i got my first break, a broadway musical. no. yes. we started rehearsals last monday. that's wonderful. congratulations. well, i suppose you'll get to be a big star now and forget well, i won't forget about you, mr. parker. you're about the only friend i have. here, i'll get the button. well, you don't know how hard it is being oh, go on. i bet you have company all the time. you didn't buy all this stuff just for yourself. oh, a friend of mine is coming by this evening to help me rehearse my song. uh-huh. hey, you know... if i thought you'd go to opening night, well, you just try to keep me away! that's wonderful... i'll take them in for you. no, no, no, no. now, i can get them. you think you can handle them? mmm-hmm. well, all right. there you are. thanks so much. you're very welcome. bye. bye. how are you, mr. parker? never felt better, charlie. how is everything oh, you know, bottles and cans, that's the way it goes. that's the old fight, boy. you going up? yeah, going up, going down, you're late. i stopped to help a young lady with her packages. well, aren't we the boy scout. who was it? tenant in 3-d. oh, that one. she's got every man in the building what did you expect me to do, let the packages fall all over the floor? well, i thought you might stand on i was merely being neighborly. your dinner will be ready in a minute, lover-boy. you know what would be fun to have with dinner? no, what? champagne. are you kidding? i think there's some cooking sherry left. no, thanks. you're safe now, miss elliott. but it was a good thing i got here on time. you and your dirty gang. well, you'll get me. but, remember, there are still nine bullets in this luger and i intend to take a few of you with me. what happened? i think you took a few of them with you. oh... oh, i had a terrible nightmare. you always do when you read this stuff. this one was terrible, just terrible. what time is it? it's after midnight. i think i'll read a little. not in here you won't. i sat around all evening and listened to you snore well, i'm not. maybe i can get a good movie on the late show. keep the volume down or you'll have mrs. bolton all right. all right, all right. don't wake up the whole house. oh, miss elliott. mr. parker, i am awfully sorry to bother you... well, i saw your light on the fire escape. well, that's all right. is something wrong? yes. something's happened and i don't know what to do. i was hoping... listen, could you come down to my apartment? you mean, right now? it's 2:00 in the morning. can't it... can't it wait till tomorrow? no, tomorrow will be too late. there's nobody else i can turn to. nobody i can depend on. well, if it's an emergency. you just give me a minute no, no, no, no, please. there isn't time for that. but if anybody saw me going in your apartment, 2:00 a. m. in the morning dressed like this... mr. parker, everybody knows you're a perfect gentleman. please, i need your help. well, all right. well, i guess we really ought to have some light. now, what seems to be the trouble? that. who's that? bill neilson. oh, that piano player in 2-a. yes. he was just helping me rehearse my song and i can't move him. well, let's pour a little cold water on him. he hasn't been drinking. then why is he lying there? i think he's dead. dead! he just passed out or something. he was shot. you mean with a gun? from out there. he was just pouring his champagne when somebody shot him from right here. see? miss elliott, that's murder. i know it is. we'd better call the police right away. no, no, no! you've got to help me you mean, carry him? he's too heavy for me to lift and you're strong. miss elliott, we can't go moving a dead body, we'll get in trouble with the police. the police never even have to know nobody knows he was visiting me. we could put him down in the basement. miss elliott, i can't get involved in a murder. i'm a married man. if i did a thing like that people would think we were... what would people think of me if he was found here? my reputation would be ruined. now listen, harry, if this gets out, they'll take me out of the show. and i already wrote home and i told my family and now this. oh, please help me. well, maybe we could drag him out in the hall. it'll be so much safer in the basement. and nobody would ever know. and i won't lose my part. oh, couldn't we just see if we could lift him? you grab his hands. now pull as hard as you can. here we go. here we go. now, turn him. oh, gee. now hold him. i am. hold him. now let him go. i'll get the door. wait. okay, come on. the rug's all covered with blood. i'll think about that later. you can put him down now. put him down? i will never get him up again. where are the lights? over there. behind the trunk, would that be a good place? any place. okay, let's get out of here. okay. wait. what? we ought to make it look as if he's been robbed. then nobody would ever suspect us. what do you mean us? uh... i'll get his wallet. oh, please don't... oh, come on. miss elliott. what are you doing? well, just a minute. well, i... here, you can have... no, i don't want it. i'm involved enough in this... come on, let's get out of here. oh, harry, i'm so grateful. i don't know how to thank you. i just don't know what i would have done hey, sleeping beauty. come on, wake up. it's after 8:00. i didn't kill him! i didn't kill him! i only helped her hide the body. i hope you have it well hidden. it's down in the cellar. behind the trunks. you had a double-feature last night. oh. oh! oh, norma. this wasn't a dream. somebody shot him from the fire escape. there was blood all over the rug. in technicolor yet. i'll get you some coffee. listen. this really happened. at 2:00 this morning, i heard a knock at the door and i went to the door do you mean she was up here last night? yes. she came to the door. it was an emergency. so you went galloping off, like sir galahad, well, i wanted to change but there wasn't time. i thought a pipe had burst or something. so you went down to her apartment. what could i do? i didn't know there was a body there. a man? that piano player from 2-a. neilson. somebody shot him here. at 2:00 in the morning? and nobody even heard well, i had the tv playing pretty loudly. so she murdered her boyfriend and you helped her do it. no. she didn't kill him. the shot came from the fire escape. you believed that? well, of course, listen, norma, i'm an accessory to a murder. i'll go to jail. well, don't give yourself up just yet. don't you understand? i carried the body down to the cellar i lost the sash to my bathrobe and i had to go down there again did you find it? it's in the pocket of my bathrobe. you almost had me believing it for a minute. it was just another nightmare. oh, no. it wasn't. well, it isn't in the pocket. it's through the loops. i remember stuffing it in the pocket. maybe you put it back. i haven't touched your robe. it was just another nightmare. well, it was awfully real. well, remember the time you dreamed that somebody that was awfully real, too. yeah. it sure was. you're not just saying this to make me feel better? you really think it was a nightmare? why don't you go down there and find out? i don't want to go down there. oh, harry. good morning. oh, hi. going up? yeah. don't think i've met you yet. harry parker. how do you do, mr. parker? my name's orsatti. you just moved in? uh-huh. i think you'll like it. it's a nice apartment, plenty of storage space, too. you could hide a body yes, you could, if you wanted to, i guess somebody wanted to. we just found one over there. a dead body? yeah. behind that trunk over there. i'm investigating it. you're a detective? lieutenant orsatti, didn't i tell you? no, i don't think you mentioned it. yeah. fellow named neilson. bill neilson. do you know him? well, i've heard him playing the piano and all. kind of a lover-boy, we've been told. somebody shot him. here. here, eh? way we figured it, he was murdered upstairs and the body was brought probably took two people to handle it. going up, mr. parker? oh, yes. just a few questions, mr. parker. won't take long. i dare say, you two know each other. miss elliott, mr. parker. you live upstairs, don't you? yes, i do. so, this is the guy, huh? yes, sergeant. no, i'm not the guy. you mean, you don't live in 4-d? i do, but i certainly didn't kill him. neilson was shot between 1:10 and 1:30. where were you at that time? i was upstairs watching the late show. you can ask my wife. she knows i was there. the way we figure it, we got a jealousy angle here. neilson was romancing miss elliott and... he was only helping me rehearse. at 1:15 in the morning? yes. well, whatever it was, somebody didn't like it we found the revolver in the alley, one bullet fired. matches up. well, i didn't shoot him. i only carried him downstairs. oh, harry. that's very interesting, mr. parker. why? for her. i see. no, you don't. i scarcely know miss elliott. i have only carried her packages a few times. now let me get this straight. you mean you made yourself an accessory to murder that's not exactly the way it was. i didn't think so. miss elliott didn't kill him. you don't seriously think he was shot while in her apartment. anybody could have climbed up that fire escape. you've got a point there, mr. parker. and if she didn't kill him, i'm not an accessory you moved the body. that's tampering i guess i didn't think of that. if you don't mind my saying so, that was a pretty stupid thing to do. and the da is going to want to talk to you about that. you can go now. miss elliott, did you get a look at the person i told you, no. i didn't even know what had happened at first. then when i finally got over to the window, there was no sign of anybody. and you've no idea who it might be? no! and i've got to get to rehearsal. harry, what are you doing back? they found neilson's body. did you hear what i said? they found the body. i know. they've already talked to me about it. i told them everything. i told them i... i took the body down what did they say? i may be charged with tampering with evidence. it's all that girl's fault. the shot came from the fire escape. how do they know? it could have been and the window broken later. how did you know the window that's probably the police. shall i let them in? what else can you do? mrs. parker, i'm afraid you haven't told me the truth. you said, you scarcely knew neilson. now we find out that you were in the habit of seeing him regularly while your husband was at work. norma, you weren't... it wasn't what you think. he was nice to me. at least he didn't seem to find me dull. you don't even notice what i'm wearing anymore. seems miss elliott moved in and kind of busted things up isn't that what happened? i can't believe it. i can't believe you were... i wasn't. it was just because i was lonely. you haven't paid any attention to me since that blonde moved in. oh, i didn't kill neilson. i don't know anything about it! somebody must have come up the fire escape and shot him. i'm sorry, mrs. parker, but that's impossible. the killer couldn't have come up the fire escape because the retractable ladder hasn't been lowered. you know, there's only one way he or she could have gotten and that's through the window of your apartment. or the apartment upstairs. mrs. bolton's apartment? she's 74 years old and has arthritis. i'm sorry, mrs. parker. i'm going to have to take you downtown for questioning. don't say anything more, norma. i'll get you the best lawyer i can. no matter what you've done, you're still my wife. that's mighty decent of you, mr. parker. but you better get that lawyer for yourself. i'm arresting you for the murder me? you. you had the same motive and the same opportunity. you were jealous of neilson because you had a yen for miss elliott and he beat you out. there was never anything between us. because he got there first. and you had a wife. so you killed neilson and almost got your wife that's ridiculous. you thought you'd have a clear field. you're trying to frame me. i was sitting right in this chair watching television. she could have slipped past me. harry. she could have. but she didn't. she was in the bedroom. mrs. bolton had her on the phone complaining the murder was committed while they were talking. any other ideas, mr. parker? i didn't think so. you can call your lawyer now that was amusing. although i think norma was a poor sport about it all. and now the time has come for us to part. but, please. no long goodbyes. don't even look back. i want to remember you as you were. so, until next time, good night."
1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"captain's log, stardate 41309.5. we are orbiting persephone v, where i have been sent to confer with admiral mark jameson in regard to an extraordinary situation. starfleet received this subspace transmission two days ago, admiral. - let's see it, captain. - on viewer. i am karnas, governor of mordan iv. a dissident group of terrorists have taken federation ambassador hawkins and his staffhostage. they will not discuss terms with me. this is a crisis i cannot resolve. the terrorists are demanding a federation negotiator. i feel there is only one negotiator with the skills to resolve the situation. the lives of the hostages depends on starfleet bringing this man here. cmdr mark jameson. admiral jameson. the terrorists have given you six earth days to deliver him, or the hostages will die. starfleet cannot understand why this crisis has developed. mordan iv has finally gained peace after decades of civil war. - 40 years of civil war, captain. - yes, sir. karnas was largely responsible for the planet's unification and peace. why should he now be unable to deal with this rebellious faction? 45 years ago i negotiated a hostage situation on mordan, captain. karnas was a young man then,... but so was l. he seems to feel that i can handle things again. i'm to take you to mordan iv as soon as you're ready, admiral. my wife and i will beam aboard at 1500 hours, captain. - acknowledge. - received and acknowledged, sir. picard out. nearly 1 500 now, sir. well, number one, let's go and welcome the admiral aboard. welcome aboard, admiral. this is my executive officer, cmdr riker. my pleasure, sir. ma'am. my wife, anne. captain, there are certain details of this mission you should understand before we begin. - yes, sir. - i am not just an adviser. on any assignment i accompany, starfleet has designated me senior mission officer. i control the away team and all its actions. is that understood? of course, captain, you command the ship, but the mission is mine. i trust you are in full agreement? yes, sir. of course. space, the final frontier. these are the voyages of the starship enterprise. its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilisations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. message coming in from mordan, sir. put it on the screen, mr data. mordan iv to enterprise. this is karnas. i will speak to the captain. i am capt picard, commanding the enterprise. is admiral jameson on board? he's here, beside my first officer. do you wish to speak to him now? so, jameson, i see time has not been kind. it seldom is, karnas. but we could save a good deal of it, if you'll outline the terrorists' demands. they insist all discussions will take place here on mordan. they refuse to speak to me, only to a federation mediator. they say they will brook no excuses. if there are any offered, the hostages will die... unpleasantly. i believe them. so should you, admiral. tell them... i accept the conditions of negotiation. i will do so immediately. he doesn't seem to know much about the situation. wrong, number one. he told me that the terrorists are desperate enough to kill if crossed. they are willing to talk, one on one, but not to him. counsellor? from his body language, as well as his words and tone, i'd judge that what karnas said was honest. but i sensed a holding back. perhaps he knows more about them than he's prepared to admit. possible, but i suspect it's closer to the mark if we said he doesn't want to admit failure of his own efforts to negotiate. - he is a proud man. - that could be. karnas has established himself as a powerful man on mordan. suddenly, in this situation, his power is useless. sickbay to bridge. i'm ready for admiral jameson now. in a few moments, doctor. ready for what, captain? it's just a routine medical checkup. ship's regulations. i don't understand how karnas knew that you were still... available. - still alive, you mean? - you could've been dead. quite right, commander, but i am not, and i imagine ambassador hawkins has told him that. i briefed the ambassador about mordan before he took up residence. karnas has a problem he thinks you can resolve. what do the terrorists need that karnas can't, or won't, give them? mordan's had peace for five years. they're finally at a state of productivity which satisfies their planetary needs, but no more than that. perhaps the dissidents feel the federation could provide more. i have negotiated many treaties on many planets. peace, or the appearance of it, is often a prelude to war. admiral, are you suggesting the terrorists want arms and weapons? they may. i am suggesting that karnas is the last man to give them weapons. i see. you believe that karnas would not negotiate on that point, and so the terrorists demanded an outside negotiator. i know karnas. he is a warrior. he lives for challenge. these people have insulted his honour by taking the embassy staff hostage. i'll negotiate, but i'll have to be very careful in dealing with karnas. he'll want revenge for that insult. well, it's about time. couldn't get away from the bridge? didn't want to. feels good to be on one again. i'm glad, mark. you want me to help you up? you're stronger today. i'm fine. i feel like a kid again. this ship is magnificent. it even has family quarters. pity we didn't have them 20, 30 years ago. we could have been together almost all of your career. - mark? i'll get sickbay. - no. there's no need. it's... happened before. when? you haven't said anything. it'll pass. just give me a moment. see, i'm... better. it's going away. what is it? did the doctors know? just body changes. last checkup they said i'd have to expect it. you're sure? don't lie to me. i'm sure. all the medical information the admiral provided is satisfactory. - excellent, doctor. - except for one thing. the test results he gave aren't two days old, they're two months old. the medical records coder includes the date within the file number. he lied to me and i don't know why. he is 85 years old. for some, memory starts to fail. he suffers from lverson's disease. that affects the body, not the mind. no, i have a gut feeling he's hiding something. that is an observation i would expect from troi. doctor... i do respect your opinion,... ..and i'll want you on the bridge for a few days. the admiral must remain in the best of health for these negotiations, and he might require your services. admiral, we're approaching the ldini star cluster. would you like to take the conn as we make transit? thank you, captain. i would. well, admiral, quite a little surprise you've pulled on us. yes, quite. neglected to mention... i began some new therapy before l... ieft. seems to be working. i haven't felt this good since the last time i was in space. all i needed to get me up was the thought of commanding a ship again. admiral, you only have the conn temporarily. a figure of speech. she's your ship. i'll just keep an eye on her for a while. the admiral displayed a remarkable improvement. no one recovers from lverson's disease. there's no cure, and it's never gone into remission. i know of no therapy that would produce such results. - how do you account for it? - i can't. the admiral has been confined to his chair for four years now because of lverson's. by all the medical facts we know, he should never have walked again. - look into it, doctor, thoroughly. - yes, sir. the terrorists have given you six earth days to deliver him,... ..or the hostages will die. i don't know how much more you think you can get from that tape. - my god! what's happened? - it's the new therapy i'm taking. it's... working, annie. darling! i told you i just needed to get back in space again. - you really are looking much better. - it's the new treatment. no,... come here. i hope you're heading for the bedroom. you stop it. darling, you look like you looked 20 years ago. you flatter me. now, you tell me what the hell is going on. i don't know. sickbay, medical emergency in the admiral's quarters. i found chemical substances in his blood and tissue samples, but none of them are in our pharmacopoeia. i'm still working on alien references to such substances. but he's certainly ingested something that's strongly affecting his body. specifics, doctor. i can't give specifics until i do a lot more tests. - what do you have? - his red cell count's running riot. the cellular structure of his body is changing, but we don't know what it's changing to. his dna is skewed. don't ask me how, but he even looks younger. and, captain, there are absolutely no traces of lverson's disease. you said there was no cure. none that we know of. whatever these substances are doing, at least they've done that. but how or why? it's too early to say. get me some answers, doctor. as soon as possible. yes, sir. captain. mrs jameson, i have to ask the admiral some questions. ask away. there's nothing to hide now. sir, in addition to your rank, you are particularly valuable just now. starfleet has a right to some answers. i've planned this for a long time, ever since i learned i had lverson's. - since it put me in that chair. - what did you do? there's a planet in the cerebus system: cerebus ll. they have a process that rejuvenates the body, gives you your youth back. i've heard that story. it's a myth. it's true, picard. i'm living proof. it's dangerous. the mortality rate is high, and it's very painful. aliens are seldom allowed to obtain the process, but i managed it. i negotiated a treaty for cerebus il some years ago, and they felt obligated to honour my request for the process. obviously it works rapidly, but how does it work? the herb and drug combinations are self-administered slowly over a period of two years. every response is different depending on a being's dna. i got enough for both of us, but i had to test it. i couldn't risk you. if i died, well, i was half a man, so what did it matter? - it would matter to me. - i was starting to change. it... was almost undetectable, but the improvement was there. then when this hostage crisis came up, i knew i had to be at my peak. i couldn't wait for the drug to work naturally... - so you took the whole dose? - both of them. and look at me, annie. i'm strong. i'm alert. fit. i'm fitter than you are, picard. i'm getting younger. the only question i have is why you thought it necessary to be young to negotiate the hostages' release. even willing to put your life at risk for it. i'll be on the bridge, admiral, if you want to talk further. why didn't you tell me, mark? we've always been honest with each other until now. i did it for us. i'm sure you believed that, until you had a chance to lead a mission, and to command again. then you just upended the bottle, or whatever it was, and damn everything. did you think about me at all? i obtained enough of the dosage for both of us. but you never asked if i wanted it. it's just like you to assume that what you felt was right was the answer. it was the right answer for me. it was killing you, caring for an invalid. what good was l? we can be together again. let me go. i can get you another supply of the drug. cmdr data, i wish to open a communication frequency to karnas. - aye, sir. - one moment. admiral, this is picard. may i know the reason for this communication? karnas must have tried to negotiate before he was forced to call on me. i want all the information he has access to. you said karnas was proud, and probably sensitive to his failure. is it wise to press him? i am the negotiator. karnas will have to cooperate with me, and damn his sensitivities. then may i suggest a secured channel, admiral? a sensible precaution, picard. make it so. - make it so. - aye, sir. frequency open and secured. - karnas. - what is it, admiral? we're on a secured channel, karnas. you can talk freely. who's behind this thing? you said dissidents. yes, political opponents who feel the federation will disavow me if they stir up enough trouble here. then who is it? ardan? gilnor? they're dead, jameson. a long time now. a long time i thought you were dead, too. i almost died a few times on missions, but i always survived somehow. yes. now you're returning to mordan to negotiate for hostages again. it's almost as though the 45 years in between never happened. you've never forgiven me. of course i have. it was years ago. there are no dissidents, are there? no terrorists. you have the hostages. and ifl have... ? you're coming to mordan, and you're going to negotiate for their lives. and i'm going to ask a very, very high price. - what if i refuse? - then the hostages will die. you've seen how my executioners work. they are still as efficient as they were, perhaps even more skilled now. you'll come,... even ifyou don't have much honour left. conn, are we still on schedule to arrive at mordan in 38 hours? aye, sir, we're at warp four. i want to jump to warp eight, so we arrive ahead of our announced eta. it'll throw karnas off balance, and we can catch him before he's ready. ready for what exactly? i believe karnas has the hostages and there never were any dissidents. why have you come to that conclusion? i'm not at liberty to say, but negotiations are no longer the answer. isn't the most important thing the hostages' lives? and you agree, riker? - i do. - good. because i plan to lead the away team on an armed mission to get them out of there. cmdr data, bring up the plans i requested on the viewscreen, please. aye, sir. most of mordan's principal city was devastated during the war. what was left consisted largely of a network of underground tunnels. a rats' maze. when they rebuilt the city, they built over the tunnels. i have it, sir. sir, where do these tunnels come into the picture? it's where karnas held his hostages before, and where i believe he has them now. wouldn't that be too obvious? karnas is a dogged strategist, not a brilliant one. he sticks to what works. he will kill the hostages if we do not get them out. therefore this armed raid is the only option? you don't agree? with respect, i would point out that no one else has heard karnas's demands. the federation might view them differently if they knew of them. starfleet has given me command of the away team, picard, and i intend to use them as i see fit. our anniversary is next week. our 50th. in his heart, he's still the same man you married. that's true. he still cares for you, despite the physical changes he's undergoing. but he's getting younger, and i'm... well, look at me. why did he do this? because there are lives at stake, mrs jameson. well, what about our lives, his and mine? i was looking forward to time together, finally. our retirement. now he's young again, and has his life to live over. - doctor, she has to know. - know what? - your husband... - what is it? he's not stabilising. he may not have that life to live over. we'll be at mordan in three hours. i couldn't sleep, either. i never could before a mission. i always wound up in the observation lounge, staring out, thinking. perhaps in this case,... rethinking. why is this so important? why did you risk your life to lead it? i want to save lives, captain. noble sentiments, but that's too easy an answer. you've been here before. you negotiated a release of the hostages with karnas before. why is it now your answer is an armed raid? it's my away team you're sending in there. there's something you're not saying. i have a right to know. do you know the background? the mordanites had some sophistication, but were still ruled by family tribal units. karnas's father was the ruling chief of one of the families. another tribe had him assassinated. karnas seized the passengers of a starliner and held them hostage, demanding that starfleet provide him with weapons that would enable him to defeat his rivals. that's the official record. officially, the story is that after two other mediators were murdered, i went in and negotiated with karnas to bring out the hostages. are you saying that's not the truth? it wasn't my... golden oratory that saved them, captain. i gave karnas the weapons he wanted. you did what? i gave the same weapons to his rivals. my interpretation of the prime directive. let them solve their problems with those arms on an equal basis. and that decision plunged them into 40 years of civil war. i didn't know that would happen. i thought it'd be over in a year. how would i know it would take four decades? but l... falsified the records to starfleet. i lived with that on my soul. 63 people came away safe, but millions died on mordan because i delivered those weapons. karnas could have worked for peace instead of fighting. - it's not all on your head. - but i started it. i lit the match. now finally i can vindicate myself, if only in a small way. i came to negotiate, but that isn't what karnas wants. revenge. that's why he demanded you when he knew you were still alive. i'm not going to give it to him. i will do what i should have done last time. we're taking the hostages out by force, if necessary. no deals. - prepare to energise, chief. - belay that. admiral, your proper place is on the bridge. i will remind you one more time, picard. i am the senior mission commander and i am leading this team. sir? the admiral is correct, number one. he has that right. but i am the captain of this ship, and i have a right to accompany him. riker, you're in command of the enterprise. energise. yes. perfect. we are in the m-4 tunnel, directly under the governor's residence. m-4 is a subsidiary tunnel, but it links with several main ones. sorry, sir. that does not correspond with the information in my tricoder. it is incorrect. i know the tunnels like the back of my hand. keep scanning for signs of human life forms. karnas held the hostages in these tunnels before. he'll do it again. captain, the admiral is definitely incorrect. our tunnel schematics show this was sealed off two years ago. no doubt you're right. but 45 years ago, i'm sure it joined the tunnels the admiral remembers. damn. this is steelplast, sir. fairly recent installation. this is the most direct route. set phasers to cut through it. if you have the coordinates where the hostages are, we could beam there. karnas may not have them together. there's no substitute, lieutenant, for a personal reconnoitre. admiral, there's an infrared light signal ahead. steady beam, across the tunnel, chest-high. another at waist level. - an alarm trigger or... - reset phasers to stun. take cover! look out! their phasers are set on kill. thank you, mr data. i have heard the sound before. - is he hit? - no sign of a wound. enterprise, this is picard. six to beam up, now! the admiral? sickbay. ""not good"" is a galactic understatement. sir? karnas again. on screen. there has been an armed intrusion in the tunnels beneath the city. that smells ofjameson. where is he? this is picard. i'm sorry to inform you, the admiral is critically ill. that is not my concern. sick or well, you have ten minutes to beam him down. - sickbay to bridge. - picard. dr crusher requests your presence immediately, sir. i'm on my way. sickbay. what is it, doctor? i think you'd better see for yourself. - i have to get to karnas. - i can't allow it. it's my last option. the raid failed. all i have to bargain with is myself. - bridge to picard. - picard here. a new message from karnas, sir. we deliver jameson in five minutes, or a hostage dies. 15 minutes after that, another. he promises the method of execution will be most painful. let me go. if i give myself over to him, he'll let the hostages go. it's me he wants. it means almost certain death for you. my life for how many hostages? 20? let me go. inform karnas we'll be beaming down in under five minutes. - did you say ""we"", sir? - you have your orders. aye, sir. who are you? i want jameson. karnas,... this is admiral mark jameson. this... charade will accomplish nothing, picard. beam down jameson and the hostages will be freed. continue this and they will die. and you with them. peretor karnas, you always were stubborn. i thought you wanted me. i'm here. release the hostages now. peretor was my old title. why do you call me that? i warn you, picard. this trick is going on too far. he has been coached for some devious reason. if this farce does not stop immediately, you and the hostages will be put to death. doctor! i am waiting for an explanation, captain. he is the admiral! he took an overdose of an alien de-ageing drug. he... wanted to face you with strength again, on even terms. - this is what the drug has done. - this story is unbelievable! jameson is a man of more than 80 years, not this! i want that old man, picard. i want to show him this world he helped to make. the scars on old soldiers' bodies. the graveyards of our young dead. the wasted cities that we are still rebuilding. and all of it caused by him. it was you who demanded the weapons to avenge your father's death. but jameson didn't give weapons to only us. if he had, we would have quickly beaten our enemies and there would have been peace long ago. i want him to pay for that, picard. i think mrs jameson should beam down now. enterprise, this is picard. have mrs jameson prepare to beam down. we have brought visual records we made of the admiral's deterioration. - look at them. - don't waste my time. just a few moments. - you saw the admiral en route here? - yes. - and recognised him? - yes. is this who you saw? - this is the man i want! - he's here, karnas. look. once he took the compound, there was no way to stop it. you'll have to deal with me, karnas. whatever you wanted from jameson isn't possible now. and you wanted revenge. you blamed your war on him. no doubt he had a lot to do with it, but you used the weapons. you could've tried for negotiations for peace on your planet long ago. instead, you chose to fight. how many of those 40 years of war are on your head? jameson must pay. i've sworn it to my people. 45 years ago he made the wrong decision. he wanted to right it, to atone for what he did. now all he can do is give himself up to you. he brought this retribution on himself. no. i don't believe you. you're shielding jameson on the ship. this tale is to save his life. peretor karnas,... there were only two of us in the meeting. you didn't even trust your lieutenants there. you told me that old peretor sain had ordered your father's assassination. you told me that you wanted arms to destroy him. peace... wasn't on your mind. all you wanted was revenge. and i gave you the weapons to do it. jameson told you this. if it is you, show me the scar. there! the blood cut you gave me to seal our bargain. it is you. somehow... it is you. then die by your own weapon! no. no, my revenge will be in seeing you live like this. such pain. his cells are being forced to go younger. they can't take the stress. it's like they're imploding. i can't give him anything to stop it. can you ease the pain? mark, can you hear me? yes. i will always love you. annie with the golden hair. flatterer. it's grey now. i see only the gold. rest, jameson. your long night,... and mine,... are over. the hostages will be freed immediately, captain. i'm... prepared to be... cooperative. the hostages have been freed by karnas, unharmed. the body of admiral mark jameson has been buried on mordan, at the request of his widow, and by the permission of karnas. the quest for youth, number one... so futile. age and wisdom have their graces too. i wonder if one doesn't have to have age and wisdom to appreciate that. i hope not, number one. mr la forge, prepare to take us out of orbit. - set course for lsis ill. - aye, sir. leaving orbit."

he's marrying me. you think he's going to spend the rest of his life walking around with these things on? she's right, pa. if'n he's willing to marry her, it's the least you can do. well, i guess. no. i ain't gonna. i'll marry him to you, but that's as far as it goes. but... pa. it's just the way it is, wynona. i'm still going to have to shoot him. he's a salesman. he can't be trusted. damn you, pa! it's my first chance of happiness i got. and you ain't gonna kill that. no! prin-princess. wynona! what are you doing, wynona?

""not yet."" grady, you were sedated. you were under tremendous stress. i know what i heard. well, you wanna believe in guardian angels, fine... but as far as the state's concerned... it was a faulty air pump on the injection device. i'm very sorry for all the confusion earlier... but i think we've finally got the situation under control. what does that mean for my client? it means we're ready to try again. wait a minute. what about what's-his-name, jones vs. f/or/da? i was just about to file a new motion to stay execution. i'm sorry, but we've got to get this done by midnight. otherwise the governor has to issue a new court order... and that could take days. my client's willing to wait. yeah. well, the governor isn't. he wants us to proceed as planned. now, we brought in a brand-new device... one that's been thoroughly tested. mr. finch, you have our sincere apologies... for what you've gone through. i give you my word we'll have no more mishaps. onto the gurney, please. don't let this happen. please. it's time, grady. not yet. help him to his feet. damn it, now what? well, where is it? well, i don't think we have a choice. all right. there's an electrical fire somewhere in the building. we're gonna have to go through with evacuation procedures. i'm telling you, he's innocent! and i believe god has shown us a sign. twice in one day, he has spared grady finch from death. we appeal to the governor to accept god's judgment... and allow grady finch to live. save grady finch! save grady finch! save grady finch! save grady finch! save grady finch! save grady finch! save grady finch! save grady finch! hi. hey. have you seen the headlines? hope you're not starting to believe your own press. have you ever had death stare you right in the face? you mean have i ever thought i was about to die? no. well, i have, twice in one day... and let me tell you something, it's pretty intense. i mean, i've been up all night thinking... why me? i don't know, maybe because you're innocent? you really think i'm the only innocent guy on death row? well, whatever answer you're looking for, grady... i don't have it. there's gotta be a reason this would be happening to me... a reason for keeping me alive. ""not yet,"" that's what she keeps saying. well, i hate to remind you of this... but the state has decided that ""not yet"" means 4 p.m. tomorrow. well, i got a weird feeling it's not the state's decision. are you comfortable, mr. finch? no complaints. as you know, you're allowed a final statement. let's get on with it. not yet. the entire system's shorting out! how the hell is that possible? the power! shut it down! shut it down right now! anybody ever tell you cigarettes are bad for your health?

grady, i need you to focus. now with all of the press you've been getting... the state's star witness is willing to recant his testimony. we're not just talking about a stay of execution anymore. we're talking about a retrial. it's about time that junkie son-of-a-bitch... told the truth. i need you to present yourself as an innocent man... who's been brutalized by the state's incompetence... that you have already suffered the tortures of the damned... that you've become the victim here. hey. hey. no worries. i got it covered. good. now i don't wanna hear any talk about visions... or voices or guardian angels. no, i don't know her name, but she definitely had wings. - mr. finch? - yes? there are hundreds of inmates on death row. what makes you so special? well, at first i thought it was just 'cause i'm innocent... but now i believe i have been spared... because i have a destiny to fulfill. all right. no more questions. wait. i wanna hear more about mr. finch's destiny. well, it's simple, really. i am living proof that there is a higher justice... and when i win my freedom... it will be my duty to spread the word... to all of those who have lost hope. the righteous will be rewarded. the innocent will be set free. ok. that's it for today. thank you. i thought we agreed... you weren't gonna say anything about visions. i'm sorry, liz. the people need to know there's a higher justice, right? you want higher justice? not yet. gun! get down! no! no! how'd he get in here? come on! out of the way! move! did you see that? anybody else wanna take a shot? go ahead. you can't kill me! no one can! good morning. morning. grady, what do you think your chances are today?

you said you were never in that store. hmm? yeah. yeah. yeah. i didn't wanna kill him. he wouldn't give me the money. all this time you've been lying. you know, you're not seeing the bigger picture here. what bigger picture? i had no choice. mr. park had to die. how else could i realize my destiny? you killed a man! you destroyed his family... and his son was begging you to confess... begging you to tell the truth. what's the point? he wants revenge, and i can't be killed. not yet. that's right. not yet. grady! i got a way with life i got a way with livin' i got a way with gettin' away with anything that i'm given i got a way with women i got a way with words i got a way to get away i got away with murder i'm alive skin deep, a quantum leap from a death sleep i'm alive free at last, beyond the past beyond the past i'm alive i'm alive not guilty. i got a way to get away i got away with murder, murder - murder - i'm alive now. oh, my god. it's said that truth and justice go hand in hand. just ask grady finch who thought he could cheat them both. consider grady's fate nothing more than a sentence deferred... in the twilight zone."

he's gonna eat us! don't be such a finch. we galapagos tortoises have no natural predators. that's so fascinating ! i never thought i'd live to see this tree again. thank you for staying with me, fry. i'm not fry. i'm his great-great-grandson, you are? my beak is different, see? lt evolved a slightly bigger hook to help me eat the cactus on this part of the island. watch ! i'm stuck! oops. so where's your lady tortoise, hubert? lady what? wait, there she is! after all these years, i've found her! oh, my darling ! you haven't aged a day! should we say something? nah. let him have his fun. all right. let's just do i'll get things started with a little then a couple of these. . . and here we go! what the tropical hell are you doing? what? i've been saving myself for 1 00 years, who is that hard-shelled skank? wait, i can explain. . . shut up! i'm going to crack that hussy open this volcanic archipelago isn't big enough yeah, you'd better topple. you always were a hot-blooded latina. like all reptiles, the galapagos tortoise okay, neck, tap, tap, climb, climb, and we're back in business. should we be watching this? lt seems kind of personal. that's not an issue for us. we're wildlife. what about the moaning? ls it okay to listen? sure, but act like it's no big deal. just pretend you're eating seeds. ls it weird if i talk about his crazy turtle penis? no. well, okay then. yes, it's been lovely. hang on a second. the galapagos tortoise lays a clutch what do you want? i'm 1 50 years old. wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! aren't you going to watch over your young? tortoises don't do that, do we? i sure as hell don't. anyway, i've done my part. the species is saved ! and so, the survival of the pinta island mama! and so, the extinction of the pinta island two hundred million years of evolution, snuffed out. for, in the end, nature is horrific, coming up next, the hilarious antics the clown of the sea. of all the spectacles in nature, few can match the mating ritual certainly not the salmon. and the tortoise? yeah, right. the huge, lumbering males defend patches of beach to deny their rivals access to the breeding grounds. just as in human society, only the biggest, most obnoxious males aw, yeah ! survival of the fattest! the dominant male, or ""beachmaster,"" maintains a harem of up to 50 females. okay, harem, let's get to it. form an orderly i like mating with beachmaster 'cause while the beachmaster enjoys the spoils of victory... whoo! i'm doin' it in my sleep! the lesser males languish at the edge of the colony, unable to attract their own harem due to age... harem? i can barely immaturity... i'm scared. or other reasons. hmm. i don't know, does this kelp scarf it's so unfair. that bloated casanova even that one with the exquisite fat rolls. back off, losers! stay away from my beaches! you big bully! bite my freshly molted, blubber-filled ass. you're just a giant lump of fat! do you even have an ass under there? i'm 40%  ass! arf, arf! now beat it! with no hope of defeating the beachmaster, some so-called ""sneaky"" males adopt a risky strategy, attempting to mate with one of his harem while he is asleep or distracted. so, any of you guys thinking of being this season? walrus don't need no chicanery. once a lady goes walrus, she never. . . she. . . no one ever goes walrus. i'm a little old for it now, but in my prime, how did you do it? well, while the beachmaster was off behind loudly fornicating with my beloved mother, i snuck past and surprised my sweetie a romantic meal? the search for food takes the elephant seal to depths few other mammals can reach. in this pitch-black abyss, life takes on bizarre so, welcome to the abyss. road trip! kill all penguins. . . kill all penguins. what's the matter with you? you just crushed yeah, we can always make more. come on, floozies, let's repopulate! with the beachmaster occupied, the sneaky male i can't believe you came!  the beachmaster'll kill you if he finds out! also, who are you? i'm in love with you ! and i don't care here, i brought you something. hurray! we're three friends at the beach ! wait, what's happening, friend? the female conveys her receptivity wanna do it? so soon? oh, well. . . - sneaky male, eh? - i thought i told you. . . oh, my! well, nice try. better luck next season. you gave it a shot! pathetic. sorry you didn't get to mate. but, hey, we can still play some beach games. who's up for some twister? no! we beta males deserve better. when we're in charge, we'll treat females keeping sensible harems of no more than five. and it begins with me. sir, i challenge you to a duel for control aw... hang on. . . okay, let's fight. that's it. no more mr. nice-jerk. the battle will rage for hours, until both males are exhausted or dead. beachmaster, stop fighting ! he's been dead since yesterday! what? he's dead? whoo! i'm killin' dudes in my sleep! yo! clean up! and so, with the threat to the beachmaster's order is restored for another year. another year, another generation of pups i'm the greatest, baby! you go, beachmaster! and so concludes our exploration for a holographic brain injection send $5 to this station, care of me, the narrator. good night. mutual of omicron. have you insured your planet?"
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"you unlock this door with the key of imagination. beyond it is another dimension- a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. you're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. you've just crossed over into the twilight zone. oh, i'm sorry, dear. you keep forgetting i'm no longer a varsity end. oh, it was fun though, huh? my doctor should have witnessed that little activity. if you persist in telling me about your ailments, i may just have to run out and get sick. it gets dull, you know. terribly dull. i just, uh... mentioned it in passing, my dear. what did you do today? you, uh... did you go shopping? oh, i had a ball. an absolute wild ball, an earthshaking ball. want to know what i did? what? well... first of all, i had breakfast. then i had lunch, and then i fired the stupid maid. and then i waited for you, harmon, dear. so, all in all, i'd say it was one of those days that made you simply want to go jump off a bridge. am i getting through to you at all? why, it's smoky the bear. flora, dear, you could start a serious fire. big daddy, one of these long, late nights, that's exactly what i'm going to do. while you're at it, why don't you pick up the remnants of that aged eyesore that i so happily knocked over a this came from my mother. it's a very old piece, flora. oh? worth what? 89 cents? i'll tell you what, big daddy. on our anniversary, i'll go out and buy you six of them. i'll take them to the dime store and have them gift-wrapped. then i'll find you some of your and play it on your old victrola. something like, uh, ""come to the wildwood church""? and other such red-hot toe-tapping numbers? it's worth very little except... except for sentimental value. that's a word you may not understand, ""sentiment."" it means ""the capacity to love."" big daddy, if i don't fill the bill, why don't you just say so right out? should you fail to know it there are 14 flights a day to reno, and i would just adore to be on any one of them. flora, i'm, uh, i'm not angry, i just wish that you would, you would... you would try to be more careful. somebody should have wished that five years ago when we took out our papers. oh, i knew you were old, harmon. i just didn't know how old. you better be careful, big daddy, because if you ever take me to a swinging weekend in egypt, i just may run away with a mummy. i'll, uh, i'll just wash up and we'll go to dinner. yeah. you do just that. we'll make it your night. we'll do something really wild like go to a band concert in the park. a picture of an aging man who leads his life as thoreau said: in quiet desperation. because harmon gordon is enslaved by a love affair with a wife 40 years his junior. because of this, he runs when he should walk, he surrenders when simple pride dictates a stand. he pines away for the lost morning of his life when he should be enjoying the evening. in short, mr. harmon gordon seeks a fountain of youth. and who's to say he won't find it? this happens to be the twilight zone. oh, great. i didn't ask you to run the mile, just to go dancing or the movies or something. don't start telling me about how you took me and introduced me to the finer things. your idea of the finer things is to hold hands in a mausoleum and listen well, get yourself a nice, tall glass of warm milk, big daddy, and curl up with an almanac, 'cause we want you happy, don't we? uh, could i talk to dr. gordon, please? yes, thank you. uh, raymond? it's harmon. raymond, i've got to talk to you tonight. would you please come over? uh, drink all right? uh, yeah, it's fine. you look a little tired, harmon. well, i've been, uh... a little rushed this past week, so... flora in bed? uh, yes, yes, she went to bed. she asked to be remembered. oh, she'll be remembered. you ought to get to know her better, raymond. she's really... she's really a very fine girl. did i say otherwise? well, i know you two haven't been exactly close, certainly not as close as a brother- and sister-in-law could be. harmon... will you do me a favor? certainly. as a matter of fact, two favors. first, don't try to sell me flora. you know what i think of her, i've told her myself to her face so i have no compunctions about saying it aloud. she's a brassy, conniving, little broad. let me finish. i could forgive her her hungers, harmon, or the fact that she's made out of asbestos and hasn't got a heart in her body. but i can't forgive her for what she's done to you. you know that she's turned you into a frightened, quaking fool. you dote on her, you give in to her, you run after her like a poodle. that's item number one. now the second favor is that from now on, after you've had your battles, don't call me at odd hours of the night. i don't do that very often. once is often and twice is endless. we're very close as brothers go. you know there isn't anything i wouldn't do for you. but i can't run over here like a saint bernard every time you get frozen halfway up the mountainside. now, she's a predatory little alley cat. and she's always been that way. i can just give you so much solace, so much sympathy, and after that, it begins to craw. now, what is it tonight? just someone to while away the hours with or is there something quite specific? um... um... this thing you, uh... been working on. go on. the cellular serum... you've been successful with it. you must be out of your mind. i'm desperate, yes, but i'm not out of my mind. you've made animals younger, i've seen it myself. you inject them with your fluid and they're young again. animals, yes. guinea pigs, white mice, hamsters. i've rejuvenated glands, organs, sometimes a complete cellular structure. but we haven't scratched the surface, harmon. we're stumbling in the dark. i want you to inject me. you don't know what's involved. we're 20 years away from trying this on a human being. why? we're dealing in basic life form. we have no idea of how much damage might result. we don't know how it will affect the metabolism of the body or the mind, or the effect on the brain. we're winging this, we've killed as many as we've saved. you said you'd do anything for me. anything within reason. oh, but this is within reason, raymond. i've come close to the end of my rope. i'm at the point where it matters very little to me whether i live or die. i want you to test this serum on me, make me young again. i don't want to get any older. aside from this pronounced death wish of yours, how would you like to spend the rest of your life as a mutated freak? or a gibbering idiot? or a mindless shell? that's not only possible, it's highly probable. we can't control an experiment on a human being. it would be catch as catch can. i'd not only take the risk, i'd welcome it. the answer is no! i wouldn't experiment on a strange bum i found on the street... raymond. ...to say nothing of my own brother. raymond, please, wait, wait. raymond, please. the answer is no. good night, raymond. thank you for coming. harmon. as a doctor, i can tell you what the effects on the human body are landing on concrete at the end of a 500-foot fall. as a man, can you tell me what the effects are on the human brain when a man is deeply, totally and dedicatedly love with a woman who can't stand the sight of him? have you even the remotest idea what kind of life this is for me? i can tell you what it could be... should be. you're a bright, charming, wealthy, discerning guy, and you've been hammered out of shape by a flashy piece of baggage not fit to wait on your table. well, whatever she is or isn't, she is the only thing on god's earth that i care about. i beg you, give me a chance. give me a chance to save myself. and if i don't? then we'll see who reaches the sidewalk first: the man in the elevator or the free-falling body. oh, my dear god. i feel sorry for you. let me think it over for an hour or two. i'll come back. is that it? that's it. what can i expect? you can expect a miracle, but you're not very likely to get it. go to bed now, don't go to work tomorrow. i'll be here early in the morning. i want to be very close to you for the next few days. well, when can i expect some change? within six hours. that's when the first physical change is noted. as for the mental change, none of the rats or guinea pigs have told me what the feeling was. i'll be the first. you'll be the first... assuming that you survive. you want to know something, raymond? i'm not only going to survive, i'm going to be young again, i can feel it. i wonder if she has any idea what she's done. even one slight little suspicion. but i promise you that if you don't survive or if you're damaged in any way, i'm going to take it out of her skin, piece by piece. she's going to donate a pint of blood for every pint that she's bled out of you. that's not a medical hypothesis, go to bed now. i'll see you in the morning. well, well, if it isn't the poor man's kildare. what brings you out into the where's harmon? when last seen, he was pounding a pillow. is he all right? what is this, e.s.p. or something? i asked you a question- is he all right? i presume he is, but if you don't think so just go in there and blow a bugle. no, i'll wait for him to get up. yeah, you do that. take off your stethoscope and make yourself at home. haven't you talked to him this morning? i haven't talked to anybody. until you pounded at the door at this ungodly hour. did you talk to him last night? he said something when he went to bed. i hardly heard him. he sounded lucid to you? look, pally, i'm not the night nurse. i think you're in the wrong ward. besides that, you bore me. how do you feel, harmon? how do you feel, harmon? i ask for vince edwards and look what they send me. ah, it's incredible what a good night's sleep will do for a man, isn't it? harmon? what have you... are you wearing makeup or something? makeup... no, no. no makeup, just a good night's sleep. well... you look so different. oh, do i? yes, you... well, you look wonderful you, you look so young. what's happened to you? ask my brother over there. no, his brother doesn't know. howdoyou feel, harmon? i feel like a million dollars that's how i feel. know what i'll do for you, ray? i'll let you take me on tour. they'll write you up in all the medical journals. but first you've got to give me four weeks. flora and i are going to go on a little ocean trip. an ocean trip? mm-hmm. well... well, that's wonderful. when do we go? i've been thinking. we ought to see if there's anything sailing tonight. unless of course you'd rather fly. oh, fly, sail, who cares? ooh, big daddy, i don't know what you've done to yourself but let me clue you in about something: i don't care, 'cause i like this fine. oh, yes, i like it fine. i don't want you to plan any trips for quite a while. oh, blow it. i'll just go and change for you, all right? where would you like to go? paris? rome? tokyo? hmm? anywhere you say. i'm your passenger. oh... mmm, ahh... why, this is incredible. you haven't looked that way since you were 30 years old. that's fantastic, it's absolutely fantastic. i keep getting younger. if i keep going at this rate, i'll be drafted. if you don't stop, we may be in trouble. oh! what do you mean, trouble? what kind of trouble? i wish i knew... how much longer it would go on or how long before it stops. oh, it's still going on. i can feel it. harmon? it's still going on, what... what is... oh... harmon? harmon, what's going on with you? what's happening? harmon? leave him go. i want him to go to bed. go to bed, harmon. raymond, you tell me what's happening to him. quiet, leave him alone! what's going on? leave him alone. what is it? sit down, flora. but i want to see him. you will. but i don't want you to wake him. he's in shock now, and sleep is precisely what he needs. i want to see him right now. no, not now. right now, flora, as of this moment, you've got to readjust your life. what are you talking about? look, is this some kind of a trick? i want to see harmon, i want to see my husband. your husband is sleeping. when he wakes up, he's going to need help. help? what kind of help? i want to see him. you will. but i think you'd best get oriented. flora, the ground rules change now. now you stay in your own yard. the world doesn't begin and end with flora anymore. it isn't just flora's wishes and flora's temperament, and flora's capacity for anger. now it's something else. it's very different. you have a responsibility now. and you're going to honor it. you're going to take care of harmon. he's going to need you. flora! if you're leaving, make note of the fact that what you're wearing is all that you take with you. if you think that i'm going to stay and take care of a grubby, thumb-sucking little kid... that's precisely what you're going to do. and short of that you leave here exactly as you arrived: unadorned. all the furs and the jewelry and anything else that my brother gave you remain here. he can't make me stay here. you can't make me stay here, either. there are other fish in this ocean, mister. indeed there are, but you're not married to them. you happen to be married to my brother. that's crazy. crazy? no. it's bizarre. and it's a fact. and if i ever hear that he's left alone with nurses, maids and governesses, you're going to find yourself right back on the chorus line do you understand? he's going to get some attention now. and i don't mean just intimate and sporadic visits between nightclubs and beauty parlors. i mean from morning till night. won't he ever grow? oh, yes. as of right now, he'll grow a little bit older each day, like any little boy. and you'll perform the process together. as he grows older, you'll be growing old. there's a little poetic justice, flora: that you should be forced to drink from the same cup. and then when tomorrow comes, there'll be someone younger outside waiting to come in. always waiting to come in. but it isn't fair, raymond. it just isn't fair. everything... everything is on his side. well, you see, flora, as you get older, see how wise you get. it happens to be a fact. as one gets older, one does get wiser. if you don't believe it, ask flora. ask her any day of the ensuing weeks of her life as she takes notes during the coming years and realizes that the worm has turned. youth has taken over. it's simply the way the calendar crumbles... in the twilight zone. and now, mr. serling. next time a new author joins the ranks of the elves and gremlins who supply the imaginative material onthe twilight zone. his name is richard deroy and his story is in the best tradition of the program. it stars one of the gentlest, and certainly the most able of america's actors, a beloved little fixture on the american scene named ed wynn. next time out onthe twilight zone, ed wynn stars in ""90 years without slumbering."""

i thought we were going to a movie. oh, no, i've got a headache. aw. bad day at the office, ollie? yeah, yeah, they're all bad. you know that pete radcliff? well, he's after my job. he didn't impress me as that kind of fella at all. please, why do you have to disagree with everything i say? oh, now, ollie, you're just tired and cross. you've got a headache, and you just take this and you'll feel better. what are you doing? seeing if you've got a fever. you might have caught that flu bug that's been going around. i'm all right. i'm all right. please just leave me alone. stop fussing over me. ollie... ollie, somebody's fooling around out in the garage. in the... i'll go take a look. who's out there? what was it? uh, nobody there. what was that light i saw? well, it was the car itself. a faulty connection or something. the lights kept going on and off by themselves. a car shouldn't act like that. i just paid the repair shop $35 to have it put into shape. didn't see the paper while you were out there, did you? no. boy's late. i guess it's the rain. there was an accident this evening at the corner of third and park. could you... uh, well, i'm a friend of the family's. could you tell me, how is the boy? yes. uh... terrible. ollie, what on earth is that? must be some jerk waking people up in the middle of the night. ollie, that'syourhorn. isn't it terrible about that little boy? only 12 years old, and they don't expect him to live. i hope they find the man who did it so they can give him what's coming to him. how do you know it was a man? didn't you get that far? there was a witness. how do you expect to do a day's work on one little piece of toast? well... i'm not going to go to the office today, lil, i... i don't feel very well. okay, lie down then. i thought you fixed that. i did. you're sure there wasn't somebody in the garage last night? i told you, it's that car- it's old car, nothing about it works right. we've had a lot of old cars that didn't go honking their heads off in the middle of the night. i'm going to get rid of it. well, i'm going down and have it looked at. yes, yes, third and park. well, i don't know what's the matter. it just stopped and it won't start again. could you please send a tow truck right away? i'm in the middle of the street. lil, what took you so long? i never... i never had such a morning in my life- that car... well, what about the car? well, it's in the repair shop. i had to take a cab home. what happened? the strangest thing i've ever seen. it all started down here at the corner. i wanted to turn right. i could not make that wheel turn the way i wanted to go. and then finally, the car stalls at the intersection of third and park. stalled? yes, the motor died. there i was right in the middle of the street, blocking traffic. why, even the police couldn't get it started. what were the police doing there? oh, they weren't after me. it's the same corner where that little child was run down last night. police said to keep a look out in case the criminal returns to the scene of the crime. did they say if they had any leads? well, yes, they're getting close to an arrest. i hope they get him. nobody's safe with a madman like that around. i thought you said the... the car was in the repair shop. well, it is. what are you trying to do? what are you talking about? you said the car was in the repair shop. well, it was. what's it doing here? wait a minute. i'll get it. hello? yes, yes, speaking. no, i didn't pick it up. yes. yes, i know where it is. it's right here. didn't one of your men deliver it? no, no, no, i don't understand it either, but i'd like you to understand one thing. don't bother to send me a bill. you didn't have the car down there long enough to even look it over. what do you think about that? was that the mechanic? they said they lost the car. the nerve of that guy. it's not lost, it's right here. will you explain to me how it got here? they didn't deliver it. well, it didn't drive itself home. wait a minute, don't answer that. well, why not? well, uh, all right, but if it's for me, just say that i'm not home. ollie, what on earth is frightening you? nothing, nothing. i just don't feel like seeing anybody, that's all. i don't know what it is, but if you don't get over these heebie-jeebies, i'm calling a doctor. morning, mrs. pope. well, what a nice surprise. ollie here? yes, he's in the living room. can i see him? yes, just for a minute. he's kind of under the weather today. it's nothing serious. i think he's just got a touch of the flu. guess who's here. ollie, boy. oh. i hear the flu bug got you down. well, no, no, not quite. i'll be back in the morning. well, i hope so. gets kind of dull down there without you. oh? what brings you out here, pete? when you didn't show up at the office, i thought i'd clear up your ""in"" basket. keep your hands off of my desk. i've got some very important correspondence in that basket. not anymore, i took care of it. your letters, sir, all answered and waiting for your signature. all answered... ollie! i'm sorry, ollie, i... only wanted to do you a favor. you can do me a favor. quit bucking for my job, huh? i take one morning off and you start making noises likeyou're the head of the department. you got it wrong, ollie. i was only trying to help you. i didn't want things to pile up on you. don't try. you listen to me. you think i enjoyed sitting in that office dictating your lousy letters? i got better things to do, buddy boy. nobody's holding you here. go do them. you bet i will. pete... i'm sorry, i... shouldn't have blown up at him like that. last night, a kid on our block was run down. i knew him. he used to come over and play with my kids. there was one nice, decent, fun-loving, ambitious little kid and some maniac smashed into him and left him lying there in the rain. i know. we've been reading about it in the papers. terrible shame. well, they're watching the corner. he'll show up, they always do. you don't happen to know how the little boy's getting on, do you? he died, mrs. pope. about an hour ago. oh... well... i'll see you to the door. i think that's him. that won't do, you have to be sure. that's him, i'm sure. wait here. could i see your driver's license please? sure. mind if i ask why? where were you last night at 6:15? home with my wife and kids. i got a witness says you're wrong. ollie, what on earth's the matter? oliver? they arrested that hit-and-run driver, lil. well, i'm glad to hear it but is that any reason for you to look white as a ghost? the man they arrested was pete radcliff. oh, i don't believe that. here, read for yourself. positively identified by an eyewitness at the scene of the accident. i still can't believe it. you can tell if a man would do a thing like that. pete just isn't the type. you don't know him as well as i do. well, i suppose not. you always have said he was sneaky- after your job and all. i don't have to worry about that anymore. well, how can you take satisfaction out of somebody else's misfortune? i don't mean i got any pleasure out of it. i mean, i don't have to worry about things down at the office anymore. now, thereissomebody out in that garage. i am not imagining it this time. there's nobody out there. are you going to look? that noise could have come from anywhere. it came from the garage. if you're afraid, i'll call the police. no- no. i'll go. who's in here? ) no... no... ollie? ollie! what? some nut's got his radio on as high as it'll go. it seems to me like it's coming from the cassidys'. oh?

0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"""the city of b'hala"", painted nearly 20,000 years ago. jadzia... you're looking at the most important bajoran icon ever painted, the only known proof that b'hala ever existed, and all you have to say is, ""hmm""? no. it's just that you both gave it such a build-up i thought it would be a lot... bigger. we've tried to force its return from the cardassians since the end of the occupation. it's good to have it back. i thought it's being returned to the ilvia state museum? tomorrow. but i couldn't let it pass without stealing a look. sometimes, being the emissary isn't such a bad thing. you see this? it's a bantaca spire. ancient bajoran cities were built around them. they were 11 metres high, made from stones fitted so tightly together they didn't need mortar. they marked the city's place in the cosmos. beautiful markings. supposedly, they're the coordinates of the lost city. but we can't see the other markings so they're impossible to decipher. which is why b'hala is likely to remain lost. before you pack it up, have it scanned into the computer. you're going to study it? try and find the lost city? i was just thinking about zocal's third prophecy. it said only someone who had been touched by the prophets could find the ruins of b'hala. no pressure. computer, magnify grid c-4. it's a reflection. magnify d-2. computer, process sisko image file 3-7-6. reduce in size 75%. ah, yes. superimpose grid d-2. reverse image and enhance. - sorry to disturb you, captain, but... - but what? - it's after 3:00 in the morning. - 3:00? already? time flies when you're having fun. i want you to save this program for me. - what is it? - an ancient puzzle. captain, if you like puzzles, i have a wide assortment of pleasure mazes. they all have a surprise in the centre. never mind, quark. i'll save the program myself. computer, quark to infirmary. medical emergency in holosuite 4. - you said the captain's all right. - lucky for you. then why am i being arrested? i already told you it was an accident, a minor technical difficulty. you can't arrest someone for that. but i can arrest you for negligence. your holosuites are in desperate need of maintenance. i've been telling chief o'brien that for the past week. i begged him to have rom fix them, but he said, ""rom's busy upgrading the sensor array."" anyone can fix the sensor array, but no one can fix the holosuites like my brother. so, you see... if anyone should be arrested, it's chief o'brien. tell it to the magistrate. no sign of permanent neural damage. although, i am reading some odd synaptic potentials. let me ask you something. does my uniform look brighter to you? yes. everything does. colours seem more intense and shapes more focused. post-neural shock syndrome. your neural pathways were overloaded. all external stimuli will seem more pronounced. it will take time to settle down so i'll put you on restricted duty for three days. if you experience other side effects - headaches, dizziness, even nausea - let me know immediately. in the meantime, enjoy the show. did dinner meet with the sisko stamp of approval? grandpa would be so proud of you. i was worried i overcooked the lingta roast but i'm glad you liked it anyway. - can i get you anything else? - no, i'm fine. i guess you'll be cooking tomorrow night. why is that? to welcome back kasidy yates to the station. maybe cook some of that jambalaya that she likes so much. we'll see. dad, kasidy spent six months in prison for helping the maquis. - she's paid the price for what she did. - i suppose so. i just hope you give her a chance, that's all. you two had something together. dad. - dad, what is it? - these shapes... i know what they are. - 'ops to captain sisko.' - go ahead. 'i have admiral whatley calling from starfleet headquarters.' i'll take it in here. - hello, ben. how have you been? - never better. glad to hear it. i know you've been waiting for this news. i'm glad to be able to tell you. bajor's petition to join the federation has been approved. - it's about time. - congratulations, ben. you've done a hell of a job. we're not the only ones who think so. the bajorans want the signing ceremony to happen on your station. spruce up that floating bicycle wheel of yours. count on a lot of brass showing up for this one. sh! shh! computer, spotlight. drum roll! ""welcome klingons."" not that one. - i see you're prepared for anything. - never hurts. you think federation membership will be good for business? of course. this station will be busier than an alvanian beehive. i expect to do five times the volume in root beer alone. you see... it's all about foot traffic. the more people come in, the more they drink and talk. the more they talk the more they let slip things i shouldn't know and that... that always leads to latinum. - there is one problem. - what's that? an ancient klingon proverb says, ""you cannot loosen a man's tongue with root beer."" it is wonderful news, vedek mera. i'll see you at the signing ceremony. enjoying the celebration? starfleet should accept a new member every week. are you celebrating, major? five years ago, i wouldn't have been. i didn't think federation membership was right for bajor. it hadn't been long since the occupation and i thought we had to stand on our own two feet. - what changed your mind? - a lot of things. my time on the station, my dealings with starfleet... but mostly the captain. - he can be very persuasive. - no doubt about it. - he made me a believer. - i'll drink to that. where is the captain? i'd like to congratulate him. he was here for a little while but i think he went back to the holosuite. don't worry. i fixed it. captain. sir? is something wrong? captain! benjamin. - major. - are you all right? i was there. sir? b'hala. it was the eve of the peldor festival. i could hear them ringing the temple chimes. - you were dreaming. - no! i was there. i could smell the burning bateret leaves... ...taste the incense on the wind. i was standing in front of the obelisk and as i looked up i understood it all - b'hala, the orbs, the occupation, the discovery of the wormhole. - the coming war with the dominion. - you could see the future and past? for one moment i could see the pattern that held it all together. you were having a pagh'tem'far, a sacred vision. hell, i don't know what i had, but it felt wonderful. the prophets chose well when they made you their emissary. how does it all fit together? i wish i knew. someone woke me up. i was worried about you. i understand. if i found you in the middle of a pagh'tem'far i'd be worried about you, too. - 'o'brien to captain sisko.' - go ahead. 'sir, kai winn is on her way to the station. 'she should arrive in less than two hours.' major kira will greet her at the airlock. make my apologies. tell the kai that i am busy today but i'll meet with her tomorrow. tell... - make something up. - where are you going to be? right here. the answer is in this spire. i know it. - kai winn. - greetings, my child. - you look very sweet. - looks can be deceiving. - but you know that. - why isn't the emissary here? i'm afraid captain sisko's busy. still basking in starfleet command adulation? something like that. i'm sure the federation is very pleased with him. - i thought everyone was. - well, not everyone. our culture has had only five short years to recover from the occupation. only five years of freedom. it hardly seems enough time. bajor is still going to be free. i see working beside captain sisko all these years has had quite an influence on you. i have to give you credit. you never give up. the emissary will consider everything you have to say. then bajor's admittance can go forward. unobstructed. i await the will of the prophets. hello, ben. - kasidy. - jake said i could find you here. - something wrong? - ah, no. not at all. i'm just surprised. i didn't know you'd be happy to see me. what are you doing for the next few hours? i don't know. i just got here. - why don't you come to bajor with me? - now? i know where to find b'hala, the sacred lost city of bajor. you see these markings here? they're a coordinate system keyed to mark the position of stars at a certain time of night. you don't know what i'm talking about, do you? - not a clue. - come to bajor and i will show you. - i'm not sure where i'm staying yet. - you can have your old quarters. if you want them. they're still available? everything is as you left it. i have some pull with the c.o. ben... - i've missed you. - i'm glad you're back. let's go find b'hala. i don't think you'll take no for an answer. this way. oh! we must be 200 metres underground. i don't want to be negative but this doesn't look like a lost city. you're looking at 20,000 years of sediment here. - stay close. we're not far from... - what's the matter? it's nothing. i'll be all right in a second. julian said that headaches might be a side effect of the accident. or obsessing over an ancient bajoran city - is that a side effect, too? you're being negative again. come on. it's just around the bend. - what is it? - b'hala. ben, it's a wall of stone. but what's behind the wall? admiral colti's quarters are not appropriate. she outranks admiral veta. then we'll put her in h-2, veta in d-9, and rifkin in k-4. that will not do. rifkin commands a starship. protocol requires he be given equal quarters. - he's only a captain. - it is naval tradition. so is keelhauling, but right now we should focus on accommodations. don't you agree, major? major? i'm sorry. i didn't mean to interrupt your reverie. i was thinking about captain sisko finding b'hala. bajoran archaeologists have searched for the sacred city for 10,000 years. he found it in a few days. your gods granted the captain a powerful vision. or he made a very lucky guess. it's a sign. a sign from the prophets. i wonder if the prophets can help us find quarters for captain rifkin. i hope i'm not interrupting. could i have a word with you, major? of course. - good luck. - i was about to say the same to you. child, you and the emissary are close, are you not? i consider captain sisko a friend. so you know his mind, how he thinks, how he reacts in certain situations. i'm not really sure what you're asking. i'm asking if you think the emissary will forgive me. - forgive you? - for doubting him. he must have been aware that i never believed he was the emissary. - i'm sure it crossed his mind. - i was wrong. only someone touched by the prophets could have found b'hala. so you're not going to try to block bajor's admittance into the federation? i'm going to follow the path the emissary has laid out for us. i must admit... i'm surprised to hear that. it takes courage to admit you're wrong. - and you think i lack courage? - i didn't say that. but it is what you think. those of you in the resistance are all the same. you think you're the only ones who fought the cardassians, that you saved bajor single-handedly. perhaps you forget, the cardassians arrested anyone teaching the word of the prophets. i was in a cardassian prison camp for five years, and i can remember each and every beating i suffered. and while you had your weapons to protect you, all i had was my faith and my courage. walk with the prophets, child. i know i will. - hello, admiral. - ben. - so this is the ancient city of balla. - b'hala. missing for 20,000 years, and you found it. pretty impressive. sure as hell impressed the bajorans. - how did you know where to look? - a vision. i know that's what the bajorans think. but just between me and you, what really happened? i know it's hard to understand but it really was a vision. for the past few days i've had these moments of insights, flashes of understanding. and they started after that accident. i don't know. this is a little strange. you didn't come here to see b'hala, did you? no, i came to see you. i was surprised you weren't on the station when i arrived. i'm sorry about that. not sorry enough to return my com signals. all three of them. that could get an officer in a lot of trouble. look, ben... i need to know that i can count on you. bajor's admission is only the beginning. now comes the hard part. federation council members have to be chosen. the bajoran militia has to be absorbed into starfleet. thousands of details have to be overseen, and you're our point man here. we need to depend on you more than ever. don't worry. i won't let you down. good. now let's get back to the station. i can't go back to the station. not yet. the bajorans can take it from here. or were you thinking of digging up this city by yourself? charlie, i just need a little more time. - for what? - for answers. there's clarity here. i wish i could explain it better but i can't! - you're scaring me with this, ben. - i'm a little scared, too, admiral. all right. i'll give you some time. but i want you back on the station by 0700 hours tomorrow. report to dr bashir for a complete physical. - i'll be there. - good. it's 0715. where the hell is he? his runabout only docked 25 minutes ago, sir. give him a full workup. before he left he didn't complain of any new symptoms but my scan still showed odd synaptic potentials. i hoped the problem would cure itself. it hasn't. isn't there something you can do? i could try neuro-polaric induction. but that's a very serious operation and i'd rather not do that unless it were absolutely necessary. so in the meantime, he's going to keep having visions. i knew there would be trouble when he let them call him ""emissary”. he didn't have much choice. the bajorans are deeply committed to their spirituality, not to mention incredibly stubborn. they believe he is the emissary. nothing will change their minds. i told you he'd be here, sir. there's no need to worry. the katterpod harvest will be much better this year. you don't belong here. go home. - what's wrong? - i'm fine. - admiral. - what is it, ben? your son. you can stop worrying about him. he forgives you. how the hell did he know that kevin and i weren't getting along? he's the emissary. that should do it. i'll have the test results in a few minutes. well. that wasn't so bad, was it? captain? - cardassia. - sir? that's where it was going. the cloud. - what cloud? - i was on bajor. b'hala was rebuilt. the people were in the streets celebrating. but then a shadow covered the sun. we looked up and saw a cloud filling the sky. a swarm of locusts, billions of them. they hovered above the city. the noise was deafening. but just as quickly as they came, they moved on. now i know where they were going. cardassia. - what do you think it means? - i don't know. at least the swarm was moving away from bajor. that's a good sign, isn't it? but what do the locusts represent? and why cardassia? - dreams don't always make sense. - this was no dream. why didn't you tell me about the headaches? i guess i was too busy. if you'd stayed busy much longer, you could have died. the area of unusual neural activity has increased another 8%. your basal ganglia are depolarising. i'll have to operate, try to repolarise your neural sheaths. - how will that affect my visions? - that's not really the issue here. - it is to me. doctor? - there's no way to tell for sure. but i assume if i can complete the procedure, your brain activity will return to normal and the visions will stop. - then you can't do it. - ben, that's ridiculous. if i don't operate, sir... ...you could die. i understand that. but something is happening to me. something extraordinary. i have to see it through. you have to let dr bashir operate on you. don't you see? these visions are gifts. i can't refuse them. i cannot believe what i'm hearing. listen to yourself, sitting there telling us that this journey is more important than watching your son grow up. dad, please think about what you're doing. these visions... they're not worth dying for. i remember the first time i held you in my hands. you were only a few minutes old. and i looked down at your face, and it was almost as if i could see your whole life stretched out in front of you. all the joys it would bring, and the bruises... it was all there, hidden in that scrunched-up little face. the baby that i'm holding in my hands now... is the universe itself. and i need time to study its face. look at the face of your son now and then tell me you're doing the right thing. come in. it's time, emissary, if you're ready. - i am. - ready for what? the emissary has asked for help in his journey. i'm providing it. and you trust her? since when? jake... it'll be all right. i love you. both of you. the temple is so crowded. every bajoran on the station was praying for the emissary. glad to hear it. he will need all the help he can get. the captain is not going to die. the prophets will take care of him. i'd rather see julian take care of him. chief, i know you're worried. but the prophets are leading the emissary for a reason. do not attempt to convince them. they cannot understand. since when did you believe in the prophets? what i believe in... is faith. without it there can be no victory. with strong faith, he will prevail. that's not much to bet his life on. you're wrong. it's everything. i hope you're right, major. i hope you're right. he asks for your guidance. let him see you with your eyes. lift the veil of darkness that obscures his path. emissary? i'm ready. the orb of prophecy is very powerful. it taxes even the healthy. are you sure you want to go through with this? i have to. i need to bring the visions into focus... tie them together. i can't do it alone. but you're very weak. perhaps it would be better to wait till after the signing. i may not have time. i need to do it now. as you wish. may the prophets reveal their wisdom to you, emissary. he's already an hour late. he's still consulting the orb of prophecy. how long do these orb experiences last? minutes. hours. sometimes days. maybe we shouldn't wait for him. do you object to proceeding without captain sisko? i'm sure the emissary would want to be here. but under the circumstances... may i have your attention? i've been looking forward to this day for many years, i'm sure all of you have. welcoming a new planet is the happiest assignment an admiral can hope for. the federation is not just a union of planets. it's much more. emissary! - get him to the infirmary. - no! - i have to tell them. - what is it? have the prophets revealed something to you? locusts... they'll destroy bajor unless it stands alone. - what are you talking about? - it's too soon! bajor must not join the federation. if it does, it will be destroyed. the central nervous system is depolarising. - we have to operate immediately. - then do it. captain sisko said he didn't want surgery. what are you suggesting? we let him die? it isn't about what you or i want. it's about the captain. he doesn't want anything interfering with his visions. these visions may be important, but i think we all agree that they are not as important as captain sisko's life. - start the procedures. - it's not that simple. captain sisko refused surgery and i can't go against his decision. not without the express consent of his closest relative. i guess that means it's up to me. dad... i know you want to see this thing to the end... but... i need you. i'm sorry. do what you have to do. prepare for surgery. i have to ask you all to leave. nurse. - any news about the emissary? - he's still in surgery. i hope the prophets will forgive us. we shouldn't have allowed the federation to interfere. it was his son and he had every right to make that decision. it was a selfish act. he's a boy who doesn't want to lose his father. what would you have done? i would trust the prophets. maybe we're the ones who need to trust the prophets. this may be part of their plan. maybe they've told captain sisko everything they want him to know. perhaps. i suppose you heard that bajor won't join the federation today. the council of ministers will delay acceptance of federation membership. - you must be very pleased. - i wish i were. but things are not that simple. not anymore. before captain sisko found b'hala, my path was clear. i knew who my enemies were. but now, nothing is certain. makes life interesting, doesn't it? no. - no! you took them away. - we had no choice. you were dying. i almost had it. almost understood it all. now it's gone. yes? - how are you feeling? - i'm fine, admiral. look, it's not too late. contact the chamber of ministers, tell them you were wrong. convince them to accept federation membership. i can't do that. the visions may have faded. but everything i said, everything i did, still feels right. when i said bajor should wait before it joins the federation, i have never felt so certain about anything in my life. i was afraid you would say that. - i could have your commission for this. - i know. but considering how the bajorans feel about you, if i pulled you from this post, we'd probably lose bajor forever. admiral, for what it's worth, i wish things had turned out differently. - so do i. - but it's not over. one day bajor will join the federation. that i am sure of. are you speaking as a starfleet captain or as the emissary of the prophets? both. in that case, i'll keep the champagne on ice. just in time, dad. - what's this all about? - it's about jambalaya. we never had that welcome back dinner for kasidy. welcome back... to both of us. i can't say i understand what you've gone through. you feel you've lost something important, and maybe you have. but believe me... you've held on to something important as well. english"
0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"doomed. doomed to a violent end, that clara nash was. i'm telling you, sergeant. doomed to a violent end. i know, mrs. slocum, you told me. three times, already. and i'm trying to find out, with your help, who murdered her. the horror of it all. and that wonderful mr. nash. and that poor little boy. whatever is gonna become of him. mom, please, mom. try to control yourself. and to think that i was practically the last one to see her alive. me. mrs. slocum, if you could just give me a few minutes of your valuable time, l- my valuable time. well, thank you very much, sergeant. you hear that, janie? the sergeant wants a few minutes of my valuable time. just goes to show how a person's whole life can be changed... just by somebody getting murdered. first, there was the flowers from the women's club... with a very kind note of sympathy. plus an invitation... to tell about my experiences on the fatal night. and now the sergeant wants a few minutes of my valuable time. well, let's face it, janie. how much was my valuable time worth, yesterday? 85 cents an hour, plus carfare. i was just a plain, simple baby-sitter. but look at me now. mom, lie down for a while. the sergeant will come back later. i just remembered something. that's more like it, mrs. slocum. i sent my black taffeta to the cleaners... and it's never gonna be back in time for that meeting at the women's club. i'll be back. really, sergeant. my mother's a wonderful woman. she just suffers from overacting. that's the understatement of the year. oh, mercy. you must be that detective. say, i got a few ideas about that murder. i'll bet you have. well. where's your mother, honey? mrs. armstedder, take it easy. she's really had a rough day. there you are, lottie. boy, do you look a mess. well, come on, honey, refreshments. we got a lot of talking to do. now. oh. move over. isn't this exciting? look at that. ""baby-sitter questioned in murder."" it's in every paper. your name, your picture, everything. gee, makes a person afraid to go out on a job. you know, i was supposed to sit for the thompsons tonight. but now... i bet you never wanna baby-sit again. well, you'd always be imagining a killer was sneaking around or something. come on, lottie, i bet you're just dying to tell me all about it. move over, will you? well, if that's your attitude. it's cherry chocolate with tutti-frutti. there. come on now, tell me. what was she really like? it's a long, long story, blanche. well, don't worry. i've got refills. well, go on. you know, how i've often said... that sometimes a pretty face will do you more harm than good. well, that clara nash was doomed to a violent end. way she was carrying on, she deserved what she got. shame on you, lottie. go on. you know how particular i am about who i sit for. well, i never would've sat for her. except i had a soft spot in my heart for the boy. and that wonderful mr. nash. what a gentleman he was. and the way she treated him, he deserved something better. did you see the flowers the women's club sent? potted plant would be less trouble. the way she's been carrying on. since the separation, not even divorced, mind you. running around with lounge lizards like that mr. de mario. he was the one that took her out last night, before she was killed. listen... do you think that de mario did it? who knows? gives me the creeps. he's the slippery type, you know. well, why not him? listen, he brings her home, see. they've been drinking maybe. then she asks him to drive you home to get rid of him. but he fools her, he comes back. did act kind of peculiar in the car, coming home. never opened his mouth once, except to say good night. that was kind of funny, wasn't it? yeah. well, as i say, anybody could've done it. they say when they found her strangled- i don't even wanna think about that. she was never any good. even right from the beginning, when i first started sitting for the nashes. long before they were separated. i remember one night. they were supposed to go to his boss's house for dinner. so i got there at 7.:00 like i was supposed to. mrs. nash was picking on mr. nash something awful. it wasn't as if i was snooping or anything. she must've known i was standing there, but that didn't stop her. not for one minute. yakety, yakety yak. mad as a wet hen she was. poor mr. nash, you could see he was suffering... but didn't have a chance with big mouth. and what was she blowing her top about this time? well, i'll tell you. because she didn't want to go to the boss's house for dinner. just because mr. nash asked her to change her dress. you should've seen her, decked out like a showgirl or something. but she refused to get into something respectable. she'd rather go out someplace fancy the way she was... than keep her husband on good terms with his boss. i won't even repeat some of the things she had to say. and that poor man, what he must have been going through. she even had the nerve to make him call his boss... to say they couldn't come. and do you know what she was doing while he was calling? she just laughed. well, she could afford to. she won. i couldn't keep my mouth shut any longer and i let her have it. i simply told her that she didn't deserve a man like mr. nash. and she had the nerve to get sore about it, even though i was right. it might've ended up in a real hair-pulling contest... if it hadn't been for mr. nash. but... such a gentleman. he just couldn't stand by and let her abuse me. he had to tear us apart practically. but i guess he didn't really mind. i guess he was flattered that i stuck up for him... because, right then and there, he asked me... how such a wonderful, understanding woman like me... had stayed a widow so long. blanche, he was divine. so what? so what, what? so you don't think he meant anything personal? i mean about your being so wonderful and still single and everything. who knows what he meant. well, what's so funny? lottie, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, and at your age. my age. his age. same age. give a little, take a little. besides, who'd have him even if he asked me? that i'd like to see. well, don't kill yourself laughing, blanche. i may be a size 14, but i could get to be a size 10 for him. for a man like that, i could even get to be beautiful. for a man like that, a woman would do anything. just anything. lottie, you didn't... didn't what? you didn't kill her? what? have some more cake, mom. no, not for me. i'm gonna start cutting down. you know, janie, you wouldn't believe it. but when your father and me was married, i weighed only 98 pounds. he used to call me ""peanut."" used to brag about my figure to everybody. in a nice way, of course. funny how a woman lets herself go when there's no man around. well, those afternoon teas that you and mrs. armstedder indulge in... don't help either, mom. you know, janie, sometimes i think blanche armstedder isn't all there. only sometimes? i'll do the dishes, honey. you run down to the drugstore and get me tonight's papers. i wanna see what they say about me. okay, i'll be right back. all right. get all the papers. 98 pounds. for goodness' sake. a person has no privacy around here. mr. de mario. mind if i come in? no, of course not. my daughter- i just saw her going down the street, so i know you're alone. yes. as a matter of fact, i am. to what do i owe the pleasure of this visit, mr. de mario? pleasure? i just dropped in to give you a little piece of advice. what about? about the murder of clara nash. i don't know anything about that. yeah, i know. but you've got an overworked imagination. clara used to tell me how you liked to dream things up. she thought it was very funny. only it might not be so funny now. i've already told them everything i know... and i didn't tell them anything but the truth. that's what i'm worried about. when you run out of the truth, what are you gonna say then? nothing, nothing at all. you just keep repeating that, mrs. slocum. it could mean a whole lot to your future. thanks, honey, i don't mind if i do. say, where's your mother anyway, it's almost dinner time. well, she can't be out much longer. as soon as the stores close, she's got to come home. what a good girl you are. always waiting for your mother. like the other night, for instance. it was real nice of you to wait till she got home. what time was it, anyway? she got in around 2:00 a.m. you're sure 'cause you were up? no, i'm not sure. then how can you be sure? i'm not. it's just that she said she got in then. then you wouldn't know if she went out again. really, mrs. armstedder. why don't you stick to solitaire? janie, what do you think? a lady at the hairdresser's asked me for my autograph... and the man at the corner said i ought to sell my story to the chronicle. are you still here, blanche? well, jane asked me to dinner. say, you've got a new hairdo. well, looks pretty nice. gives you height. say, what all did you buy, lottie? nothing really. jane, it's for you. on second thought, it's too young for you. size 10? i don't get it. well, you will. with this, i'm gonna lose pounds like water. wait, i'll show you. all this wouldn't have anything to do with a certain gentleman... whose initials are ""charles nash""? where do you get your ideas? now, look, this is what you're supposed to do. you're supposed to kind of, like, lasso your feet. lasso your feet. like that, see. and then you pull yourself up. you're bending your knees. shut up. well, i'm glad to see you're feeling better, mrs. slocum. how do you do? may i help you up? well, i'm not feeling better, i'm not well at all. i just keep trying. that's why i'm here, mrs. slocum. i'm gonna ask you to try to remember if there are any details that you overlooked. like what, for instance? well, supposing we go through the whole thing again. right from the start. read me what i said yesterday. that's not exactly the idea, mrs. slocum. it's a cross-examination. that's where they catch you if you're lying. shh. fire away. i'll answer your questions. thank you, ma'am. let's start with de mario. de mario? yes. he says that he brought mrs. nash home at approximately 1:45 a.m. now, does that check with you? check. do you have anything further to say about this? no. and he left immediately after with you in the car, right? right. what did he talk about on the way home? nothing. nothing? nothing. well, didn't he say anything when he dropped you off? nothing. nothing? nothing! well, he must've said something when he dropped you off, mrs. slocum. he said, ""good night."" now, look. de mario has been unable to account for his time... from then until 4:00 a.m. now, exactly what time did you get home? they can't prove it, lottie. now, don't say another word until you see a lawyer. i don't need a lawyer. i answered all the questions. i think i've got a headache. i wish you'd go away. mom. i don't know what got into that police officer... but don't be upset. everybody knows you had nothing to do with it. do you still want me to sit for you at the blakes tonight? are you sure you're gonna be all right here alone? i'll be back as early as i can, mom. dear mr. nash... the time has come when i need you. i'm all mixed up... especially after what happened the night of the murder. i like to keep myself busy when i'm baby-sitting. makes the time go by quicker. it was a good book, very romantic. i couldn't wait to find out what happened. so after i finished the book i looked around for something else to do. you've no idea how empty the life of a baby-sitter is. and how quiet. it's not as if i were a teenager... with lots of friends to keep me company. bobby was sound asleep. such an angel. and with a mother like that. but again, you're his father. i guess it takes two to tango, if you get what i mean. that woman sure was some housekeeper. never saw such a mess. but then, i guess she didn't have time for such things. dust, just like i expected. it was funny seeing the two of us hanging there. her and me. i remember when your coat used to be there, too, mr. nash. i always used to hang mine next to it. i guess you can tell by now i'm romantic. you always bought her such pretty things. maybe it's not nice of me to talk about the dead. you gave me quite a turn coming in like that, mr. nash. but you had your key, and why not? you pay the rent. i could smell you'd been drinking... but who could blame you, with all your troubles. you weren't even sore at me for trying on the coat. i guess you never thought i could look so good. it's that blonde beaver. it does something for a woman. even me. such a good father. it was so cozy, just the two of us. just as if it had always been that way. and then she came back. we heard them out there. her and that mr. de mario, laughing. it was shameful the way those two were carrying on. it really hurt me to see the look on your face. it was nice of you not to want to be present... when she came in with that boyfriend of hers. you knew you could trust me not to tell her you were in the bedroom. of course, i don't believe that you had anything to do... with what happened later. but you see, it's the police i'm worried about, mr. nash. maybe tomorrow they'll ask me about you. so i thought if we could get together... you know... dinner for two, tête-à-tête. mr. nash, come in, come in. what a wonderful surprise. i wasn't expecting anybody but you're very welcome, i'm sure. you won't believe this, but i was just writing a letter to you. wait a minute and i'll go and get it for you. now, isn't that a coincidence. if you'd given me a little warning... i might've fixed up a tiny bit. i never was so surprised to see anybody in my life. well, here it is. by special messenger. i was beginning to get worried. but i didn't tell them anything, like i promised. not a word. they never asked me if you were there the night of the murder... so i didn't think it was wrong not to tell them anything. well, mr. nash, whatever are you doing? mr. nash! and now, i suppose you babies who have just put the sitter to bed... are wondering about mr. nash. he escaped in his automobile, but not for long. he was soon arrested... for failing to yield the right of way. well, he wasn't exactly arrested. you see, it was a train that he failed to yield to. and now, children, if you aren't naughty... and if the rabbit doesn't get drunk... drinking too much carrot tea... and fall on the elephant's trunk... next week i'll tell you another story. good night."

'on our way, chief. ' so where's the straw? i assume you want gold spun from straw. what are you? surely you must know. you told the little one all about me. i know what you look like, but you're not... don't say it! i don't like the sound of it, you know. rumpelstiltskin. you didn't think that would make me disappear, did you? not this time. i learned my lesson back in the kingdom. i don't make deals like that anymore. the local constabularies. show me a bit of courtesy and i'll be very pleasant, but touch me and you'll regret it. besides, i'm much too fast for you. and now, my good host, if gold is not your pleasure, tell me your needs and i'll tell you my price. - o'brien to sisko. - go ahead, chief. - 'i need you in my quarters. ' - i'm on my way. - dad, i've got to talk to you. - i don't have time. i'm... hello, ben. he followed me home from the holosuite. - jadzia! - hello, julian. - what are you doing? - waiting for you to wake up. - i'm awake. - is something wrong? funny, i was about to ask you the same question. it must be this larosian virus that's been going around. - how do you feel? - wonderful. no fever. must be me! must be me. must be an allergic reaction to the replicated antipasto i had at lunch. perhaps... i must be hallucinating. - why are you fighting this? - why am i fighting this? why... am i fighting this? i have no good answer to that question. 'all senior officers report to ops immediately. ' ok. i get it. very funny. did o'brien put you up to this? i don't know what you're talking about. ""senior officers to ops. "" everybody has a good laugh at my expense. - this is not a joke, julian. - we'll see. ah, good. we have a small mystery on our hands. lieutenant jadzia dax and dr julian bashir, meet harmon bokai, a baseball player who's been dead for 200 years. i can't figure it out either. and a medieval fairy-tale character named rumpelstiltskin. fine. now everyone knows my name. until today, he only existed in storybooks. a pleasure, i'm sure. could this be related to increased thoron emissions in the plasma field? thoron emissions? i think you'd better ask me, benjamin. i was hitting a few to the boy. he's been moving well onto the ball. we would have worked on some base running except he was hungry and i was, too. - a hologram with an appetite? - hologram? on the contrary, major. he's quite real. they all seem to be. what the hell are they talking about, ben? you. you're not actually buck bokai. so how come i'm wearing his uniform? you're a hologram that i created so we could play ball with you. but i remember. i remember all the games. all the opening days. the homer that won the '42 world series. the squeaker that went under eddie newson's glove. the day i broke dimaggio's consecutive streak. i programmed it into the computer. all of it. every statistic. what foreign tongue are they speaking? this one didn't come out of any holosuite. he came out of your imagination, like buck came out of jake's. his imagination? then i must have come out of your imagination, julian. not necessarily. well... maybe. how could this sort of thing possibly happen? a subspace disruption. maybe some kind of dimensional shift. i didn't see an anomaly on the plasma field but the sensors could have missed it. julian, let's go to your quarters. please. i haven't got time for this. - 'odo to sisko. ' - go ahead. - 'do you have something to tell me? ' - constable, what do you need? are the environmental controls broken down? - it's snowing on the promenade. - 'snowing? ' we're looking at five or six centimetres. - we're going to yellow alert. - 'what's going on? ' it seems we're letting our imaginations run wild. when i have an explanation, i'll give you one. sisko out. yellow alert? against our own imaginations? you have a better idea? i think i've got something. look at the wave patterns. the wave fronts are converging. the particle density rises closer to the centre but then it just drops off completely. i'm reading no particulates at the core. - what does that mean? - whatever falls in there is just gone. you were right. it is some kind of subspace disruption. i want a full analysis. chief, get a class-4 probe ready. aye, sir. is there anything i can do to help? - 'odo to ops. ' - go ahead. the snow's disappeared but now there's a gunji jackdaw running loose around here. just try to keep things under control. we're working on it. understood. come along now. come along. there we go. ladies and gentlemen, may i have your attention, please? ladies and gentlemen, and all androgynous creatures, your attention. as you may have noticed, we're experiencing some difficulties. i have to ask you to refrain from using your imaginations. just because you don't have an imagination, don't ruin it for the rest of us. let me guess. another clever federation experiment has gone awry and you've turned the whole station into one vast holosuite. the phenomenon is being investigated as we speak. well, tell them to take their time. i haven't had a chance to show the ladies my collection of tartaras landscapes yet. i'm surprised by your attitude, quark. you simply don't have the same appreciation for... art as i do. dabo! i'm surprised because every one of your customers is winning. - what? - they're taking you to the poorhouse. dabo! another winner! no, that's not possible. let me through! lose. lose! one cross... two cross. no! no! you're outnumbered, quark. pardon me. pardon me. i was afraid of this. the proximity of the wormhole is amplifying the rupture. the proton counts are going through the roof. dax to o'brien. how's that probe, chief? 'i'll have the scanners programmed soon. ' keep me informed. dax out. i have the wave intensity analysis. computer, scan all data files - for comparable wave intensity patterns. - 'stand by. ' jadzia... i find this difficult to say but i want you to know, i would... julian, there's really no need to apologise. in a way i feel as if we've invaded your privacy. we all have fantasies and dreams we keep to ourselves, thoughts that should remain private. - i'm glad you understand. - of course i do. i was a young man... once. so we can put all this behind us? - of course. - good. the computer seems to be having trouble finding a match. she really is submissive, isn't she? is that how you want me to be, julian? so submissive? i am not submissive. am i? er... no. well, i don't think so. i'm just not the cold fish you are. cold fish? now i never said that. if you'd get down off your high horse you'd start to appreciate julian. she has a sense of humour, as i imagine you do. i could use one about now. come on, lieutenant. stop denying all those yearnings you feel. yearnings? if you don't you'll never know what you missed. - 'pattern match found. ' - just in the nick of time. a similar subspace rupture was reported in the hanoli system in the 23rd century. - i don't know where that is. - there's no reason you should. when the rupture expanded, the system was destroyed. station log, stardate 46853.2. we launched a probe to study the anomaly. more than half the people aboard ds9 have reported manifestations of their imagined thoughts. 'all probe systems are reading normal. ' calibrating sensors for subspace. three minutes to coordinates. wave patterns should begin fluctuating any time now. there. the probe is penetrating the thoron field. two and a half minutes to coordinates. for simpler times, eh? - go away. - i only want to help. you're in the way. a farmer from derry once tried to chase me off... until i saved his crops... from locusts. two minutes to coordinates. thoron emissions are stable. you know what i find intriguing about you, my good host? you're afraid. of me. look, figment, i'm not afraid of anybody, least of all you. 90 seconds to coordinates. - figment, am i? - a figment of my imagination. and yet you can't deny how this imagination of yours empowers me. empowers me in a way that somehow terrifies you. you should be getting primary data, commander. 'they're coming in now, chief. ' she is your firstborn, isn't she? 30 seconds to coordinates. thoron emission patterns unstable. - probe hull temperature dropping rapidly. - ten seconds. the probe's at the anomaly perimeter. - that's strange. - what is it? negative readings on all sensors. we may be looking at some sort of folded space. what does the scanner on the probe give us? it's drawing in all the matter from the surrounding space. benjamin, it's getting larger. feel like taking some groundballs? you're on a space station. the only ball field around is a holographic simulation. - it's not real, and neither are you. - i don't get it. i pinch myself and it hurts and i am here. you are, but in a minute, who knows? - when we get this figured out, you'll... - disappear for good? - i hope so. - you do? let's just say i don't. what should i do? you got room for a switch-hitting third baseman with good power? - good power from the left side. - left side? ben! hey! hey, ben! what are you talking about? i hit over 20 homers right-handed every year for three years. never more than ten after that. old crow moved me to second. i wish i had time for this. well, that was baseball's epitaph, wasn't it? nobody seemed to have time for us anymore. i could have played five more years if they hadn't killed the game. you were the best that ever played. i know. i've played with them all. - i've got work to do. - hey, ben. it really meant a lot to me - how much you cared. that day we won the world series there were only 300 people in the stands. 301 in my version. i heard you cheering. meant a lot to me. i just thought you should know, you know, in case i do finally disappear. ops. we don't know any more than when we started. why would mine create a woman, then reject her? why would mine create a dwarf that could terrify him? we should abandon the whole thing. not yet. i made a connection with mine. i sense a feeling from him, affection for a ballplayer who died 200 years before he was born. how long do you suggest we devote to this? as long as it takes. it ain't over till it's over. station log, supplemental. the subspace anomaly continues to expand. we've been unable to find a way to contain it. as a precaution we have diverted all incoming ships away from the station. a vulcan mission to the hanoli rift detonated a pulse wave torpedo at the coordinates of the tear. five minutes later, the rupture expanded radically. they were wiped out, along with the entire hanoli system. what happened to the rupture after that? it's not still there? it reached a critical mass point and imploded and then disappeared from normal space. did the vulcans report about hallucinations? anything similar to what we're experiencing? no, but they were only near the anomaly for 12 hours. and vulcans don't have the most active imaginations. were there any explanations offered for the initial cause of the rupture? nothing confirmed. but we know there were no wormholes and little activity in the area before it formed. we've looked for some common ground, a way to attack this thing. frankly, sir, as funny as it sounds, pulse wave torpedoes may still be the best approach. if it didn't work very well last time, why... the vulcans were using a primitive device. we've developed far better ways of controlling the flux density. we should be able to contain the reaction this time. if we can't, we destroy the whole bajoran system. major, the rupture is already expanding. we seal it or it destroys the system anyway. if it's small we have a better chance. - how long will it take to make a torpedo? - until 22:00 hours. if the rift expands before imploding we have to be prepared. route auxiliary power to shields. major, coordinate evacuation of the pylons. odo can help you. dismissed. - kira to odo. - what is it? do a security sweep of the pylons. we're going to evacuate. i've got my hands full now. clear the way! let them through. clear the way now! kira to ops. lower pylon one is gone. i need emergency... 'sisko to kira. report. kira, can you read me? ' 'major kira, report. ' disregard, commander. false alarm. kira out. all personnel in lower pylon one, report to outer ring airlock. prepare for evacuation. clear the way. clear the way. stay inside. this isn't a show. odo! odo! odo! odo! thank goodness. i want to report two missing persons. i'm busy! don't scare them! they're whispering sweet nothings then they're gone. will you get off the street, before... girls! i've been looking everywhere for you. don't ever do that to me again. so, odo, what have you conjured up during all this? - me? - i should have guessed. nothing. i've spent all my time chasing incarnations of the prophets, long-dead lovers, gunji jackdaws, blizzards, trollops... ah. as i always said, a man without any imagination. come along, my dears. i'll show you what a fertile imagination can do. imagination! computer, run a level-1 personnel sweep of all pylons. 'requested function will take approximately three minutes. ' let me out of here! let me out of here...! get the nagus on subspace. i want to talk to him, and i mean now! i'm not spending another minute in this cell. - how did you get in there? - how did i get in here? you put me in here. i guess i did, didn't i? yeah. no imagination indeed. ha! heads up, jake. - what are you doing here? - i've got homework. but you'd rather be at the ball park. if i go to the holosuite, dad will kill me. - kill you? - yeah. - you really believe he'd kill you? - i know he would. if that's true, why you still thinking about going? i'm trying not to. but you're wondering if you can get away with it. well? i couldn't understand the directions. the computer accidentally erased the instruction page. you really expect me to believe that? no, i guess not. i've really got homework to do. i need to see you, benjamin. what do you have? in the last hour, the rupture's expanded 27%. the rate of expansion is increasing. can we gain time by moving the station? if the rift collapses the implosion would overtake us. how soon can you be ready? i'm installing pulse wave devices in the torpedoes now. six, seven minutes. the rift's large enough to pick up on visual scanners. on screen. magnify. all pylons are secured. everyone's been moved to the habitat ring. - you're worried. - you bet. if this doesn't work nothing real or imagined is going to survive. hold me. please. - torpedo's ready. - status of shields? all available power's been transferred. reading shield strength at 158% above normal. let's hope it's enough. red alert. fire! all systems functioning properly. torpedo guidance is on nominal track. 30 seconds to coordinates. impulse sustainer throttling down. arming pulse wave initiator. torpedo hull temperature dropping. - activating pulse waves. - compression level at 1,400 and rising. - 20 seconds. - compression at 2,900. - 3,000. - terminal targeting spread confirmed. 3,500. holding compression. ten seconds. - ready to detonate? - ready, sir. five seconds. now. wave intensity from the rift is dropping. the thoron field boundary is shrinking. particle energy is rising. - what? - wave emissions are fluctuating. - we're not getting a controlled collapse. - chief? we're picking up an exothermic reaction pattern. it may be neutralising the pulse waves. perimeter sensors are picking up a subspace oscillation. proton counts have tripled. pulse wave activity from our torpedoes is down to 14%. the flux density readings inside the rupture are off the scale. odo to ops! ops! ops! com circuits are down. i'll try to reroute pathways. - life support is normal. - shields. a generator's down. - 'odo to ops. ' - constable, check for casualties. move everybody out of section four. we have shield damage. - what are we getting from the rift? - sensors aren't operating. stand by, sir. i can't feel my hands. lie still, lie still. there's an emergency medical kit in the cabinet there. get it. - i'm sorry... - shh. - i never meant to bother you. - no, no. you didn't bother me. i can't keep my eyes open. don't close your eyes. you have a nasty concussion. i can't help it. dax. dax! sensors are back. the rupture is continuing to widen - 340 times larger than before. - is it showing signs of collapsing? - wave emissions are fluctuating. i can't make sense of these readings. proton counts are lower than before. and now they're rising again. the pulse waves from our torpedoes have been neutralised. the rift will expand again any time now. - how much time? - minutes. suggestions? run out of ideas, friend? i have a suggestion. - maybe i can help. - you? you created me with powers beyond those of mortal men and i would be happy to use them to assist you. for a price. i've always wanted a daughter. miles? sensors picking up subspace oscillations again. you can seal that rupture out there? i can spin straw into gold, my friend. this seems no more difficult. do it, damn it! will you meet my price? this is crazy. you're out of a storybook, a fairy tale. are you willing to give her up to save so many others? no. he doesn't have to. dax, when did our sensors first pick up traces of the rupture? you were there when we first tried to work this out. you said that your previous scans hadn't picked up any anomalies. i thought whatever was out there was too small to be scanned. you imagined that we had a subspace rupture and that's what it turned out to be. that is what i imagined. once you'd learned about the rift that destroyed the hanoli system, we all imagined we might have another just like it. - mr o'brien, drop the shields. - sir? there is no rupture. there is no threat to this station. end red alert and drop the shields. aye, sir. and believe it, mr o'brien. it's important that you believe it. aye, sir. are your sensors picking up magnetic shock waves? - yes, perimeter readings still show... - no shock waves at all. none at all. - lieutenant, proton counts. - normal. it's gone. you're going to be fine. of course i am. i have the best doctor in the galaxy. none of this makes any sense. why did they appear at all? it might be related to the elevated thoron emissions. the readings haven't returned to normal. continue your analysis, dax, but this time, no speculations, just facts. yes, benjamin. major, keep us on yellow alert for 26 hours, till we see that everything is back to normal. chief, take your family home. that's an order. aye, sir. this imagination of yours - it's a tough concept for us to get a handle on. you're not a figment of my imagination? we're on an extended mission exploring the galaxy. we followed one of your ships through that hole in space. we've been trying to figure out the rules of your game. why didn't you just talk to us like this? you can never tell how someone will treat the visiting team. i understand. that's what this has been all about - learning to understand. was it really necessary to put the whole station in jeopardy? but we didn't, ben. it was you. your imaginations created everything. we were just watching to see where it took you. this imagination of yours. we have never seen anything like it. it's very real to all of you but yet it's not. at first, it seemed to us to be a curse, an irritation. that odo fellow called it a waste of time. i disagree with him. i knew you would. i learned that about you. you can have an affection for someone you never met. i wonder if you appreciate how unique that imagination of yours really is. - not always. - we got to go. but you haven't told us anything about your species. i'd like to. maybe next year."
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"'a plague is devastating a planet 'in the quadrant where the enterprise is operating at present. 'it threatens to destroy the vegetation on the planet, 'leaving it uninhabitable.' we are proceeding at top warp speed to the planet ardana, where the only known source of zenite exists. it is the one substance that can halt the plague. captain, the high adviser of ardana is ready to receive you on stratos, sir. stratos? that's their cloud city, isn't it? - it is. - there must be some mistake. have you the coordinates to the mine entrance? they've been provided to the transport officer, along with those of the council chamber of the high adviser. - kirk to transporter room. - ready to transport. are you locked in on the mine entrance or on their cloud city? 'the mine entrance is what you ordered.' right. uhura, tell the high adviser to dispense with the welcoming ceremonies due to the emergency and we're beaming to the mine entrance in order to ensure the fastest possible delivery of the zenite. mr spock, come with me. tell them that we appreciate the honor and that we look forward to some visit in the future. stratos, captain, a city actually floating in the sky. looks as tranquil as its reputation. it is a most interesting metropolis. have you ever visited? once. i didn't have time to look around. i haven't. however, i hear its art forms are incomparable. art is the chief occupation. it is a totally intellectual society. all forms of violence have been eliminated. there's the mine entrance. the zenite should have been there. the miners were supposed to have made delivery when we beamed down. perhaps there is another entrance, captain. it would seem the troglytes have changed their minds about delivery. 'space - the final frontier. 'these are the voyages of the starship enterprise. 'its five-year mission, to explore strange new worlds, 'to seek out new life and new civilizations, 'to boldly go where no man has gone before.' - what's the meaning of this attack? - interference breeds attack. come on. we're here by permission on an emergency mission. move on, captain. troglytes, halt! surrender or we'll fire! - are you harmed? - no, just a little shaken up. i am plasus, high advisor of the council. - captain kirk, enterprise. mr spock. - greetings, mr advisor. my regrets for the unpleasant welcome. it was rather warm. violence is habitual with the troglytes. i assure you, this insult will not go unpunished. i'm more concerned with the zenite. why wasn't it in its location? the disrupters have confiscated it. i knew they would. the disruptors? who are they? a small group of troglyte malcontents. other troglytes are dominated by them. the disruptors have refused to continue mining for zenite. they agreed to deliver. you assured us. they agreed, as a ruse, to get valuable hostages. hostages? for what purpose? to force the council to meet their demands. organize a search party immediately and find the zenite consignment. meanwhile, i suggest that you and first officer spock be our guests on stratos. very well. i do hope the search will be brief, mr advisor. we'll do everything possible to make it so. come, gentlemen. remarkable. the finest example of sustained anti-gravity elevation i've seen. the sentinel told me of our guests. i came to extend greetings. a most gracious act. one of our planet's most incomparable works of art. my daughter droxine. captain james kirk. - a pleasure. - indeed, yes, captain. and first officer spock. i have never before met a vulcan, sir. nor i a work of art, madam. come, there is much to see in our city. this is our council gallery. it is open to all city dwellers. we have some of the finest of our art forms assembled here for the viewing and contemplation of... - disruptors again! - they're despoiling the whole city. despoil? for what purpose? by keeping us in turmoil, they hope to force us to accede to their demands. - what are they? - completely unreasonable. nothing to concern you. it can't interfere with the delivery of zenite to merak ll. mr advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that planet. if all plant life is destroyed, the humanoid life will follow. i assure you you will get what you came for. i hope so. ardana is a federation member. it is your responsibility that nothing interferes with your obligation to the federation. we accept the responsibility. but why do they destroy art forms? that is a loss to everyone. art means nothing to the disruptors. this is the only form they understand. the disturbances accompanying your arrival have been wearying. - no doubt you would like to rest. - that would be most welcome. chambers have been prepared. a sentinel will guide you to them. i'm sorry they were so poorly treated on their first visit to our planet. it's fortunate they were not seriously hurt. that would have been dreadful. further violence could create difficulties between ardana and the federation. the disruptors must be mad to attack two such charming strangers. they grow more daring and determined every day. now they seek to find allies in the galaxy. do you think that captain kirk and his very attractive officer will feel we're responsible for their injuries? and i thought you were worried about our diplomatic relations. apologies, but this troglyte was apprehended leaving the city. we thought you would want to question him. remove his shields. what is your business in stratos? - speak! i command you. - my business is to repair. - repair what? - there are damaged entrance panels. indeed. then you must have a repair permit. where is it? - it was forgotten. - and you forgot your transport card? it was lost when your sentinels attacked. and where was your cavern implement lost? - could this perhaps be it? - i came to make repairs. you shall make them, by giving us the names of the disruptors. - i know nothing. - i advise you increase your knowledge. that is not possible for a troglyte. the stratos city dwellers have said it. secure him to the rostrum. how unfortunate. how unfortunate. 'this troubled planet is a place of violent contrasts. 'those who receive the rewards are separated 'from those who shoulder the burdens. 'it is not a wise leadership. 'here on stratos, everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant. 'the high advisor's charming daughter, droxine, particularly so. 'the name droxine seems appropriate for her. 'i wonder, can she retain such purity and sweetness of mind 'and be aware of the life of the people on the surface of the planet? 'there, the harsh life in the mines, is instilling the people with a bitter hatred. 'the young girl who led the attack against us when we beamed down 'was filled with the violence of desperation. 'if the lovely droxine knew of the young miners' misery, 'l wonder how the knowledge would affect her.' mr spock, i thought you accompanied captain kirk to the rest chamber. - your movements awakened me. - my apologies. i did not realize they would disturb you. only vulcan ears would find the noise discernible. it seems that vulcans are fascinatingly different, in many ways. the same may be said of stratos' inhabitants. vulcan eyes are very discerning, too. i hear that, intellectually, vulcans are as highly evolved as stratos city dwellers. we do pride ourselves on our logic. you again! you sleep lightly, captain. yes, duty is a good teacher. i see you've changed your dressmaker. release me. so you can attack me again? that would be foolish. call the guards if you're afraid, captain. i'm not afraid. in fact, i find this rather enjoyable. i do not! all right, i'll make a deal with you. you answer some questions and i'll let you up. what questions? your word first. i will answer. you only take a mate once every seven years? the seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all vulcans. at that time, the mating drive outweighs all other motivations. and is there nothing that can disturb that cycle, mr spock? extreme feminine beauty... ...is always disturbing, madam. spock? - i did not come here to kill you. - then why this? to take you hostage. am i intruding, captain? vanna. why have you come here? to welcome our guests, as i was taught to do when i served in your father's household. - has she injured you? - not at all. in fact, her visit was quite enlightening. the troglytes are under the impression the enterprise is here to intimidate them. - send a sentinel to the rest chamber. - it is not impression. it is the truth. we're here to get zenite and that's it. starships do not transport cargo. in emergencies, they do anything and this plague is an emergency. lies will not keep the troglytes in caverns and neither will a starship. you talk like a disruptor, vanna. i speak for my people. they have as much right to the clouds as you. the stratos is for advisors and studiers. what would troglytes do here? live. in the sunlight and warmth, as everyone should. the caverns are warm and your eyes are not accustomed to light. just as your minds are not accustomed to logic. unaccustomed to light and warmth? that's necessary to all humanoids. surely you don't deny it to troglytes. the troglytes are workers, captain. surely you must be aware of that. they mine zenite for shipment, till the soil. those things cannot be done here. they perform the physical toil to maintain stratos. - that is their function in our society. - but they don't share its advantages. how can they share what they do not understand? they can be taught, especially in a society that is enlightened. the separation of toil and leisure has given ardana this perfectly balanced social system. why should we change it? the surface of the planet is almost unendurable. to restrict a segment of the population to such hardship is unthinkable. the surface is marred by violence. like the troglytes. here on stratos, we have completely eliminated violence. you refuse to disclose the names of other disruptors? there are no disruptors. very well. if you prefer the rays... troglyte is an abbreviation of an ancient earth term, captain. its technical translation is cave dweller. yes. i should have realized. mr advisor! you were going to question vanna, not torture her. she is stubborn, and as you pointed out, the search for your zenite must be short. surely there are better methods. physical discomfort is persuasive. yes, but i won't stand by while someone is tortured. is it preferable to spare vanna and allow an entire planet to be destroyed? violence in reality is different from theory, is it not? but what else can they understand, mr spock? all the little things you and i understand and expect from life, such as equality, kindness, justice. they are not stratos dwellers. they're a conglomerate of inferior species. abstract concepts of an intellectual society are beyond their comprehension. abstract concepts of loyalty and leadership seem clear to vanna. a few troglytes are retainers. vanna was one, as are the sentinels. - they receive more training. - but no more consideration. i fail to see the purpose of this continued criticism. the only way you'll use that device again is on one of us. an imposing display of primitive gallantry. you realize the sentinels could remove you? of course, but starfleet command won't take kindly to having either rays or physical force used against one of its personnel. why are you so concerned with this disruptor's well-being? beyond humanitarianism, my orders are to get that zenite. - stop interfering and i'll get it. - you won't get it through torture! we will get it for you in our own way. remove the prisoner to confinement quarters. you will return to your ship at once or i shall contact starfleet command and report your interference with this planet's government. - kirk to enterprise. - 'enterprise.' - mr scott, we're ready to beam up. - 'aye, sir.' if captain kirk appears again, kill him. 'captain's log, stardate 5819.0. 'eight hours have passed since the zenite disappeared 'and we've found no trace of it. 'we received word from merak ll that the plague is spreading rapidly. 'delivery of the zenite is imperative within 12 hours or life will be annihilated.' advise starfleet command that the zenite has not been delivered. plasus' method of accomplishing delivery will not succeed. if it is not delivered, i shall violate plasus' order of non-interference and win the confidence of the troglyte leader with reason. not easy. medical analysis indicates troglytes are mentally inferior. impossible. troglytes have accepted personal sacrifice, a common cause. inferior beings aren't capable of that. i checked my findings thoroughly. their intellect readings are 20% below average. they're the same species. those on stratos and those below all originated on the planet. their evolution must be similar. that is basic biological law. that's true, but the ancestors of those who live on stratos removed themselves from the mines. they avoided the effects of natural growths. - natural growths? what kind? - i had this zenite sample sent up. unsealed, it would have had detrimental effects here. incredible. zenite is shipped wherever there is danger of plant bacteria. - no side effects have been reported. - there are none after it's refined. but in its raw state, it emits an odourless, invisible gas that retards the functioning of the mind and heightens the emotion. therefore, it releases a violent reaction. and the mines are full of that gas. right. and troglytes are constantly exposed to it. bones, the disruptors, vanna. it seems impossible. they've outwitted a scientific culture for months. as part of stratos, vanna was removed from exposure for a long period. it is likely that without exposure, the effect wears off. right. the disruptors were probably removed from the exposure. - does the brain return to normal? - it should. can you neutralize the gas? - no, but a filter mask works. - find one. go to the transporter room. this mask automatically eliminates all substance injurious to human life. we've used filter masks frequently. 'do you expect me to believe a mask can achieve equality for the troglytes?' the effect of the gas is temporary, even after repeated exposure. 'how can a filter accomplish what centuries of evolution have failed to do?' dr mccoy has analyzed the zenite. we've checked his findings through the computer. 'do your computers explain how my ancestors, who also dwelt in caverns, 'evolved sufficiently to erect stratos, while the troglytes did not?' unequal evolution did not begin until after your ancestors removed themselves from exposure to the gas. 'preposterous.' there's no time to argue. i propose to tell vanna. 'i doubt even vanna will believe such nonsense.' this nonsense means a great deal to the troglytes. i would like to offer them the filter masks in exchange for the zenite. 'i'm sorry. such an offer could only cause more unrest among them. 'i cannot allow it until we check the findings.' - that could take days. - are you afraid the masks will work? 'you are here to complete an emergency mission, not conduct tests.' i'm here to get zenite. if these help, i'll use them. i forbid it. your federation orders do not entitle you to defy local governments. this communication has ended. my diplomacy is somewhat inadequate. - hard to overcome prejudice. - it doesn't give us much choice. nor time. we have ten hours and 40 minutes to deliver that consignment. beam me down to vanna's quarters. you're going against government orders? if vanna has nothing to gain for her people, she'll die rather than turn over that zenite consignment. if you are apprehended violating the high advisor's orders, he will be within his rights to execute you. if you suggest that you contact vanna, the answer's no. that goes for you too. a first officer is more expendable than either a doctor or a captain. yes, but this is unofficial. nobody's to have any part in it, but myself. that's an order. you have the conn. stand by till i contact you. vanna... i've brought you a gift. there's a dangerous gas in the mines that affects the development of troglytes exposed to it for a period of time. this mask will prevent any further damage. - gas from zenite? - yes. it's hard to believe that something neither seen nor felt can do harm. true, but an idea can't be seen or felt. that's kept the troglytes in the mines for centuries. a mistaken idea. would all the troglytes wear these masks? yes. i'll see to it that federation engineers construct them. - suppose plasus does not agree? - he is not the whole government. that is true, but the city council will not listen to troglytes. as soon as the zenite is delivered to merak ii, i'll come back. i'll request permission to mediate for the troglytes. vanna. you must trust me. i give you my word. centuries ago stratos was built by leaders that said that all inhabitants would live there. - the troglytes are still waiting. - the zenite can be delivered in hours. - you won't have long to wait. - hours can be centuries. just as words can be lies. vanna... you must trust me. if you don't, millions of people will die. zenite is all that can save them. the filter mask is all that can save the troglytes. trust me. please. very well, captain. i will trust you. the consignment lies deep in the mines in a place known only to troglytes. i cannot direct you. i must take you there. you asked for my trust, captain. are you unwilling to give yours? it's the sentinel with my refreshment. wait. we'll need a transport pass to leave the city. - midro. - vanna. - anka. - you have returned. and i've brought with me a hostage. seize him! - why did you break our bargain? - did you really think i would trust you? - i'm not such a fool. - i trusted you. you thought you would trick me with talk of your filter and unseen gas. i don't believe you any more than plasus. then you are a fool. these masks will free you, as i said. our weapons are our freedom and you've just furnished me with two very valuable ones. yourself and this. holding me won't help. my men will come for the zenite. without your communicator, you will be hard to locate. - they'll still come. - perhaps. in the meantime, a taste of our existence, captain. dig as the troglytes do. without that mask, i haven't... with your bare hands, captain. 'captain's log supplemental, stardate 5819.3. 'first officer spock reporting. 'captain kirk beamed down to stratos to win the confidence of the troglytes. 'unless he has made his escape from stratos to the mines, 'his life is in danger from the high advisor. 'the captain has not informed us of his progress. 'for our part, we must maintain silence. 'we can be of no help without jeopardizing his life.' you dig well, captain. the unseen gas doesn't seem to be harming you. - its effects take a while. - nevertheless, you won't need this. anka, deposit this on the transport platform, so plasus will know we have something more valuable to bargain with than our mortaes and thongs. you are clever, vanna, very clever. searchers will be coming soon. go to other mines and tell them to post watchers. - what of him? - i will see that he doesn't escape. - if we kill him, there will be no need to. - a dead hostage is of no value, midro. - only the troglytes will know. - i brought him here. i will say what is to be done. you are not the only disruptor. i, too, can say. can you do nothing but argue? the searchers will be here soon. when anka returns, we will all say. is that what you're bargaining for? the right to kill everyone? - midro is a child. - the masks can change that. return to the digging, captain. how long do you plan to keep me here, providing midro doesn't kill me? until we have help in the mines and our homes are in the clouds. that's quite a while. longer than i expected. - we're sealed in. - completely. but soon the atmosphere will go. we'll die. die from something that can't be seen? you astound me, vanna. kirk to enterprise. enterprise, come in. kirk to enterprise. enterprise, come in. kirk to enterprise. 'spock here. we've been trying to make contact. anything wrong?' nothing. are you locked in on me? - yes. ready to beam up consignment. - circumstances dictate a variation. standing by for instructions. hold on these coordinates. locate the high advisor and beam him here immediately. without advance communication. repeat. without advance communication. got that? instructions clear. i shall carry them out immediately. spock out. you would seal plasus here also? for what purpose? i'm preparing a demonstration. on the effects of unbelieved gas. beam the high advisor down without warning? that's not an exact quote. however, it does express the thought. - i'd like to see the advisor's face. - you will have that opportunity. the captain did say immediately, did he not? that is an exact quote and i suggest you handle the transporter yourself. this could be a delicate problem in transporting for us and in diplomacy for the captain. - something's upsetting you. - no, father. - what is it? tell me. - really, i'm not upset. i was just looking into space and wondering whether he would return. he will never return. i have seen to it. but the zenite is so important to him. he must have it. it will be delivered if we have to kill every troglyte below. by that time, it may be too late. perhaps he does have a method... he knows nothing, except how to destroy our power and our society. i forbid you ever to speak of captain kirk, or to think of him. - transporter room to mr spock. - spock here. i've locked into the coordinates. ready to transport the high advisor. - you'll have to delay. - what's wrong? picking up two life-forms in the gallery. they're inseparably close. 'we cannot transport one without the other.' 'did you say the word ""immediately"" was an exact quote of the order?' - precisely, mr scott. - 'are we going to do anything about it?' until the high advisor is alone or can be isolated, the captain will have to wait. unless you have an alternative. 'i'll give it further thought.' i wasn't thinking of captain kirk. it's the one with those exquisitely-shaped ears. his name is spock. he's the one i was thinking about. did you know that he has the most incredibly sensitive hearing? why, i almost believe that if i stood here and called out to him, he would hear my invitation to come and visit with us for a little while longer. he's no better than his friend. shall we try? - what is it? - vanna has disappeared. her guard was found unconscious. - he'd been attacked by kirk. - where is kirk? he did not know. he just regained his senses. this is the reason they use to persuade us. - they are desperate. - i will hear no more defense of them. i'm sure mr spock would not behave so. leave here at once. go to your music. father, are we so sure of our methods that we never question what we do? spock to transporter room. lock in on council gallery coordinates. - 'locked in, sir.' - energise. energising. - how are you doing, mr scott? - fine. the high advisor's materializing on the platform. - beam him down to captain kirk. - 'energising, sir. - 'he's on his way to the captain.' - good work, mr scott. 'the advisor looked angry. i hope he doesn't give the captain trouble.' the captain will employ his usual diplomatic balm. abduction of a planet official is a serious crime. you will pay for this. not until you're convinced of the effects of zenite gas. what effects? i've been here nearly an hour! you and vanna even longer! i see no changes in any of us! perhaps you need closer exposure. fill that container. are you suggesting that i dig zenite? - i insist. - you will indeed pay for this. you, too, vanna. you, too! dig! kirk here. what is it? contact check. it has been an hour since you communicated. your orders are to stand by. now, carry them out. kirk out. standing by. however, let me remind you we have only five hours left. - that is very unlike the captain. - can the zenite be affecting him? i grow faint. the oxygen is going. she's right. kirk, transport us out of here. we'll leave when the gas has effect. it will never take effect. transport us out of here! - dig! - imbecile. we'll die! i said dig! i am high advisor of all the planet. i will take no more orders! - one more step and i'll kill you. - the gas. captain, you were right. it's taking effect. captain, you were right. are you as brave with mortae as you are with a phaser? both will kill. enterprise! enterprise, help! - enterprise! - enterprise. spock here. they'll kill each other. help us. help us! enterprise! enterprise! the zenite gas has affected you. captain! the zenite gas! zenite gas. - look out, jim! - captain! well... it seems my little demonstration was... quite a success. i don't like filters, or even masks. i like the word ""protector"" much better, don't you? it is less technical, therefore less accurate. but perhaps more descriptive of the function. it appears you have what you came for after all. the captain will have his zenite just as i agreed. there's no such word in the troglyte vocabulary. the captain will have his zenite. no thanks to an agreement by you. it had to be obtained by force. it is the only way we can obtain what is due us. and your education? was that by force? it served your purpose at the time. for all the good those filters will do you. they will be very effective, sir. troglytes will no longer suffer from retardation and emotional difficulties. they will all be like her - ungrateful, vindictive. yes. our demands have just begun. here is the zenite, captain. - just as i promised. - thank you, vanna. stratos is so pleasant and so beautiful. i think i'm afraid to leave it. there is great beauty in the knowledge that lies below. and only one way to really experience it. i shall go to the mines. i no longer wish to be limited to the clouds. is... your planet like this one? no. no, vulcan is quite different. some day i should like to visit it. perhaps a form of mediation can be helpful in your difficulties. the federation bureau of industrialization may be of aid to you. i will tolerate no interference! you will not set foot here as long as i rule! believe me, i have neither the time nor the desire to return. only answering your charges will force me back. i shall press them. you are guilty of abduction! you're guilty of attacking a starship commander! captain, perhaps both incidents are best forgotten. yes, vanna. they never happened, mr advisor. let's get that zenite delivered. i believe we only have three hours left. two hours, 59 minutes to be exact, captain. kirk to enterprise. kirk to enterprise. mr scott, beam us up."

as a matter of fact, i am rather busy at the moment. and you're always busy with something or other. never the right thing, though. my daughter tells me that we're, um, picking up someone interesting here. yes, the leading scientist from kaelon il, and... oh, kaelon ii! i've never heard of that. well, lwaxana, it is something of a rather delicate... oh... ...situation. it's the first real contact with a rather reclusive race and... this is in the nature of an official greeting, so... oh, diplomacy. oh, i adore diplomacy. everyone dresses so well. mr. o'brien, energize. dr. timicin, i'm jean-luc picard captain of the enterprise. this is lieutenant commander la forge. i beg your pardon, captain. this is my first time aboard a federation starship. oh, yes, they told me. the shaking of hands... a form of greeting. i beg your pardon. dr. timicin, allow me to present lwaxana troi of betazed. she is also a guest on board... and daughter of the fifth house holder of the sacred chalice of rixx heir to the holy rings of betazed and what are you doing for dinner? well, i don't know really. lwaxana, we have quite a bit of work planned. well, the man's never been on board a starship before, jean-luc. certainly somebody ought to make him comfortable before you get started. well, it seems that mrs. troi is our acting ambassador of goodwill for today. you just think of me as your entertainment director. that man's in a lot of trouble. **captain's log, stardate 44805.7. for generations, the people of kaelon ii have been working to revitalize their dying sun. the federation has offered to assist in testing what may be a solution to this problem. of course, the basic theories of helium fusion enhancement have been discussed for over a century but there's been no practical method of application until now. the modifications you have made in the torpedoes guidance systems are remarkable, doctor. well, we'll see. they still have to be proved. but now at least it's possible. i'd never dared to hope for such a perfect match with our own sun. my only regret is that it took us three years to find a suitable sun after you had first contacted us. we're not used to dealing with other worlds. we're not used to asking for anything from others. your offer of help has given us a possible means of survival. it has taken 40 years of my life to develop the programming that will control your photon torpedoes. it has been my life. thank you for this opportunity. my only wish has been to find a way to revive our sun... before i die. mrs. troi, i must protest your unauthorized presence on the bridge. what does that little one do, mr. woof? please, madam! that is a torpedo launch initiator, and... and it is ""worf,"" madam, not ""woof."" oh... ah! there you are, my dear. where have you been? i've been waiting for you. so nice to see you again so soon. mrs. troi. mother, what did you want? what? you were waiting for me. oh, yes, dear, of course i was. you really must let me do something to relieve the tedium of all this work, work, work. i'm afraid i'm expected in engineering. i'm really terribly sorry. oh. mrs. troi i have to ask you to clear the bridge, please. i don't see why. there are lots of other people here. mother, please. well, don't you worry. we'll just have our little chat later. i'd never have thought her old enough to be your mother. she is so... vibrant. if you look at the next simulation, you'll see that we need the temperature to stabilize at 220 million. otherwise there's a secondary then a tertiary reaction to the... ah, ah, ah! enough is enough. rescue is at hand. ah, dr. timicin. oh, would you clear all this mess off the table, please? this mess, mrs. troi... now, now, now. you boys have been shut up in here for hours. now, if you don't eat something, you're going to get sick and who's that going to help? i've made some perfectly marvelous mantickian pate. mr. homn will lay it out for us. oh, mr. homn is my valet. he doesn't say much. how can he? it is true that the intellectual efficiency of high-order beings does diminish proportionately with the deprivation of nutritious fuel... all right, all right. don't you start. mrs. troi, you're a wise woman. i'm sure we could use a respite. these two call me mrs. troi. you call me lwaxana. mr. homn spread it. so, knowing my daughter's starship would be passing fairly close to betazed again i maneuvered a ride and, um, here i am. deck eight. i also have a grown daughter. she has a small son of her own. oh. then, you're married. my wife died quite some years ago. you know, one thing i don't understand. if your people have known for generations that their sun is dying why not simply evacuate the planet? it is our home. it defines who we are as a people. if kaelon ii ceases to exist so do we. well, then you definitely should fix it. with the federation's help, i... i hope we will. and the federation will be pleased to offer whatever help it can. would you come in for a nightcap? well, that's extremely kind of you, but... my valet sleeps elsewhere. you're delightful. you make me laugh. i mean, l-i don't mean that your invitation makes me laugh. i mean, i take that quite seriously. l-i mean... oh, but... don't... just say yes. i'll make you laugh some more. i wish i could... but i must say no. good night, lwaxana. captain's log, stardate 44807.5. the enterprise has arrived at the praxillus system where we will conduct dr. timicin's helium ignition test. mother, how much...? little one, why do you refuse to use telepathy even when we're alone? we're not alone, mother. now, how much longer is this going to take? you've been selecting for 20 minutes. i am a woman dressing for a man. something you might try now and then, dear. i wonder if timicin likes green. that's not very telepathic of you. oh, i tried telepathy on him. he's the wrong species. right species for everything else, though. you might try that once in a while, too. you know, you're not just incorrigible you're insatiable. i have completed long-range scans. there are no other life-forms present in this system. spacecraft? none within sensor range. picard to engineering. mr. la forge, the system is clear. final pre-launch diagnostic, level-5. all systems verified. we're ready here when you are, captain. very well. mr. worf? photon torpedoes armed... and targeted. fire in sequence. first volley released. tracking torpedoes. entry program confirmed. second volley released. torpedoes now entering the stellar core. their shields are holding. guidance systems normal. ignition sequence, six seconds... five seconds... four... three seconds... now. shock wave patterns within predicted range. 1700 percent rise in gamma radiation levels. helium fusion rate... increasing. what about heat and pressure levels? steady so far. density at 1100 grams per cubic centimeter. density at 1100 grams per cubic centimeter. temperature approaching 60 million degrees kelvin. we want it to stabilize at 220 million. pressure wave harmonics dispersing. temperature in target zone increasing to 81 million degrees, sir. still rising. temperature at 90 million degrees kelvin. and now 110 million. looking good. one hundred thirty-seven... radiation and pressure levels still stable. temperature is 170 million degrees kelvin. one ninety... and now, 200 million. it's happening. 207... and rising. two nineteen... and twenty. two twenty... and holding. looks like congratulations may be in order. mr. data? turbulence patterns are within predicted parameters. two twenty-two. temperature is rising in the core again, captain. 230 million degrees kelvin. still rising, captain. two fifty-one. rate exceeding critical level. core density is becoming unstable. let's get the hell out of here. ensign, warp two, now! i'm sorry. captain picard? doctor. permit me to express my appreciation to you and your crew. i am most grateful. most grateful. ensign, lay in a course for kaelon ii. warp factor five. aye, sir. i'm so sorry, timicin. i had one of those named after me once. brilliant, young astronomer from rigel iv. of course, l, um, i sparkled a bit myself in those days. you see, that's called fishing for a compliment. you're supposed to tell me i still sparkle. i'm sorry. i'm not helping, am i? you're very kind. i'm just not adequate company right now. oh, that's all right. i can make enough conversation for both of us. i'll leave you alone. no. please stay. i wanted to tell you how much i wish we had met years ago. what difference do a few years make? unfortunately, a great deal. you see, lwaxana, i'm on my way home now... to... die. captain's log, stardate 44812.6. we have returned to kaelon ii and established contact with science minister b'tardat. the experiment achieved a stable core temperature for a short time, minister. that's a significant step forward. we've been studying the sensor logs and the torpedo telemetry to determine if there was any malfunction. if there was and we are able to isolate the problem another test might be successful. and in the meantime, all of our facilities would be made available to dr. timicin. a most thoughtful and generous offer but timicin has obligations at home and it would take us some time to select a replacement. we would be more than willing to extend our visit, sir. that will not be necessary. we'll contact you as soon as we're ready. we expect timicin to return home as soon as possible and again, gentlemen, many thanks. come. are you aware these people you are so graciously helping are murderers? i beg your pardon? well, the next thing to it. when a person on this benighted little planet reaches the age of 60... which timicin is about to do... they're expected to simply kill themselves. did you know that? mr. data? the people of kaelon ii are isolationists almost to the point of being xenophobes. regrettably, we know very little about their customs. well, i know. timicin himself just told me. he is supposed to go down there to his loving friends be wined, dined, honored for his achievements and then kill himself. it's a barbaric ritual. the, um...""the resolution,"" it's called. obviously, you can't let him go, jean-luc. i'm afraid i have no choice. i don't think you've been listening to me. the man is supposed to kill himself. now, you don't just let that happen. you don't just turn your back. what's the matter with you? lwaxana, i'm sorry, but whatever my personal feelings i have no jurisdiction here. i simply cannot interfere. but you have to. in a situation like this, you absolutely have to interfere. you've got to go down there. talk to those people, jean-luc. open their eyes... educate them. the prime directive forbids us to interfere with the social order of any planet. well, it's your prime directive not mine. computer, locate counselor troi. what do you mean i can't go down there? are you telling me that i'm a prisoner on this ship? mother, what's going on? what are you doing? i'm sorry, counselor. i'm not sure what to do here. well, i am sure. i am a betazoid ambassador. i'm a daughter of the fifth house and those people are going to answer to me. so, y-you just energize this damn thing and get me down there! he can't, mother. he has his orders. his orders don't apply to me. no, they apply to him. and don't you try your professional patronizing on me, young lady. they expect timicin to die, don't you realize that? just because he's 60. what's 60? it's nothing. i'll go check the pattern buffers. come on, mother,  let's sit down. l- i'm sorry, little one. l- i don't know what's wrong with me. i'm... i'm sorry. there's no need to be. but i'm crying. i don't cry. you cried when father died. you remember that? of course i remember. we both cried. but... but this isn't the same. is it? what do you think? oh... l-i don't know. i... i just can't accept that... that fate would allow me to meet him like this and then take him away. i mean, he's not ill. he hasn't had a tragic accident. he's just going to die and for no good reason. because his society has decided that's he's too old so they just dispose of him. as... as though his life no longer had any value or meaning. you can't possibly understand at your age, but, well, at mine... well, sometimes you feel tired and-and afraid. you're feeling very vulnerable. very mortal, if i may say so. but i know you, mother, and believe me you will never be one of those who dies before they die. come in. i've been studying the preliminary reports of the test. l-i don't understand where it went wrong. i thought i had taken into account all of the variables... deep convection patterns, proton reactions neutrino count. oh. i will say it again... you are a kind woman. no, no, i'm a hateful woman. i hate what you're going to do and i hate you for doing it. it is the way of my world. i wish you could accept that. i never will. never. how long have you been sitting there? oh, i don't know... a minute, an hour. lwaxana... do you want anything? some tea? i want to explain. i want... very much for you to understand. 15 to 20 centuries ago, we had no resolution. we had no such concern for our elders. as people aged, they... their health failed. they became invalids and those whose families could no longer care for them were put away into deathwatch facilities where they waited in loneliness for the end to come sometimes... for years. they had meant something and they were forced to live beyond that into a time of meaning nothing... of knowing that they could now only be the beneficiaries of younger people's patience. we are no longer that cruel, lwaxana. no, no, you're not cruel to them, you just kill them. the resolution is a celebration of life. it allows us to end our lives with dignity. ""celebration of life."" sounds very noble, very caring. what you're really saying is you got rid of the problem by getting rid of the people. it may sound that way but it is a time of transition... one generation passing on the responsibilities of life to the next. what about the responsibility of caring for the elderly? that would place a dreadful burden on the children. we raise them, we care for them, we suffer for them we keep them from harm their whole lives. now, eventually, it's their turn to take care of us. no parent should expect to be paid back for the love they've given their children. well, why the hell not? oskoids. what's that? oskoids... a betazed delicacy. looks very interesting. you should have tried it while you were still alive. no reason to bother now. why 60? why not 62? 58? a reasonable age had to be set. but it's not reasonable, certainly not in your case. you're as vital and healthy a man as i've ever known. that is why i wish to say good-bye to my family and colleagues while i am this way... in full command of my faculties knowing that they will always remember me as a strong and vigorous man. but it makes no sense. some of your people could still be active at 70 or 80 and others might be seriously ill at 50. how cruel of you to make them wait so long to commit suicide. setting a standard age for the resolution makes it uniform for everybody. to ask individual families to decide when their elders are to die... that would be heartless. i agree. why not let everybody die when they die? lwaxana... you have a grandson, you said. yes, almost seven. well, wouldn't it be better for him to know his grandfather? i mean, not some vague memory of someone who once loved him but a real, living person who does love him. don't you really think that would be better? i attended the resolution of my parents when it was their time. it was beautiful. lwaxana, this is a custom that i have known and accepted all my life. the women of betazed used to wear these enormous wigs with large holes in the center for tiny, caged creatures. yes? first, it was a fashion then it went on long enough to become a custom... a tradition... but it was uncomfortable for the woman and cruel to the animal. so then one day, one very formidable woman finally said so... refused to ever wear another of those wigs. fairly soon, the custom stopped. she had the courage to stand up and fight for change. she must have been a lot like you. timicin, there is no one more qualified more experienced, or more likely to save their planet than you and they would have you kill yourself. younger scientists will take my place. my work... the work will continue. your planet has what, 30, 40 years left? what if your scientists can't find the answer without you? what then? what chance do you think your grandson has of reaching the age of 60? enough, please! it is my time, lwaxana and that is the way it is. well, if that's the way it is, i don't know why anyone's bothering to try to save your planet at all. if it's time has come, let it die. where is the difference, timicin? where? convection boundary uncoupling. the reaction... caused gas turbulence of a totally unexpected magnitude. why? there was evidence of a delayed surface shock. no, i'd anticipated that. i thought i'd anticipated all possible variables but stars, you know, they're like living entities in a way... quite unpredictable. you know... i wouldn't be at all surprised if this were a result of... look here. 42 seconds into the test, there is a sudden rise in the level of hydrogen-alpha emissions. and here is another. i'm right, aren't i? there had to be neutron migration within the star's inner core as the reaction grew. perhaps, doctor, but there is no known method for controlling a neutron migration. yes, yes, but theoretically, it is possible. using these test results, we could construct a new computer model of the energy dynamic of a star that can test a new detonation program. i'm certain it can be accomplished, certain. it's just a matter of time. a matter of time. come. timicin. time for you to leave us then. captain... i have come to officially request... asylum aboard the enterprise. timicin, i cannot believe this. why asylum? asylum from what? i turn 60 in four days, minister. yes, and your family and colleagues are already gathering for your resolution. i believe that it is time for us to reexamine as a people, the wisdom of the resolution. are they forcing you into this? are you being coerced? influenced, perhaps. coerced? no. our only influence, minister, is by example. timicin's decision is his own free will, i assure you. i cannot believe that a man of timicin's stature would freely choose to reject his own culture. no one on kaelon ii understands this project as i do. there are new theories that would take others a decade to test and confirm. with my guidance, it could be done in half that time. i must finish my work. others started your work, others will finish it. it has always been this way. it always will. captain, scanners indicate two kaelon warships rising on an intercept course. acknowledged, commander. minister, we are here in friendship hoping to be of assistance. you have helped quite enough, captain. i suggest you return timicin and depart. if you attempt to leave orbit with timicin on board our ships have been ordered to open fire. b'tardat, there's no purpose at all in letting this become... it shouldn't have happened. i've handled this poorly. you acted in good conscience, doctor. i don't see what else you could have done. i could have let well enough alone. i could have returned home. what do you think, captain? have i done... the right thing? i'm afraid you're the only one who can answer that. lwaxana would... would have me lead a revolt. i'm only a scientist. i wish i had her strength. she is a woman of extraordinary conviction, isn't she? isn't she. any communications, number one? no, sir. we have an open channel. the warships are taking a standard attack posture. staggered approach vectors, within weapons range. shields up. red alert. captain... doctor, i suggest that you return to your quarters. i don't want there to be any bloodshed because of my decision. they will do everything they can to avoid it. i think we should get out of their way now. yes, yes, of course. i understand. mr. worf, ascertain their offensive potential. aye, sir. we must transmit the new analysis of neutron migration, immediately. if i can make them see the direction that i've taken... we've already tried. they refuse to accept further reports from you, doctor. they have to accept it. if i can reestablish a computer interface with the science ministry... they've disengaged the linkup, doctor. why don't they answer?! even if i find the solution, you will not accept it?! because i do not terminate my life they terminate my work. alive, i am a greater threat to my world than a dying sun. but jean-luc will find a way to settle this. no. he always does. no, my decision will only lead to more distrust of other worlds. nothing will change. now, don't be foolish. i am not being foolish! lwaxana, i want to live because i see in you how much i have to live for. you make me realize that my life still has value. i can be an example to my people. i can finish my work. but discovering these new desires and not being able to do anything about them... not being able to finish my work not even being able to reach my people... you are making a statement about the sanctity of life and it will be heard, timicin. who will hear it from light years away? where will i go now, lwaxana? i'm a man without a world. i can't go home. oh, timicin... bridge to dr. timicin. you have a visitor coming aboard. b'tardat? no, sir, it's your daughter. dara. father. this is lwaxana troi. she has been host and friend. i've been looking forward to meeting you, dara. whatever you have to say to me can be said in front of her. i see. father, come home. this is wrong. dara, if i could show you the work i have begun. there's still so much for me to do. there is nothing for me to look at. it is irrelevant. your father's work may save your world, my dear. i would hardly consider that irrelevant. all i'm concerned with now is you, not your work. your work is over. it is your time to rest. perhaps you will feel differently as you get a little older... say, approaching 60. my father taught me to cherish the resolution. i don't know how you have poisoned him to reject it. it's an obscene ritual. how dare you? how dare you criticize my way of life and my beliefs? please, please. dara. please. where will you go? hmm. i don't know. and where will you die? i cannot bear the thought of you being laid to rest on some other world. that you will not lie beside my mother. that i will not be able to lie beside you when my resolution comes. i'm sorry. i don't know how you can go on with your life knowing that each day is an insult to everything we believe in. father, i love you... but i am ashamed. i would like to be alone now, please. well, i'm suddenly not sure of myself. it's a feeling l-i'm not at all used to. i... i don't think i like it very much, little one. not sure of yourself? my life has been full. oh... now and then, perhaps it's overflowed a little, but... but l-i enjoy living. and now i'm asking myself is it possible i was wrong to encourage timicin to choose life? you were honest with him, mother. you had to be. maybe i want him to live just to keep me company. of course, you do but you didn't do this for yourself. you did it for him. did i? then look what i've done to him. he's like a... he's like a man who has lost his faith. i never considered how deeply ingrained this resolution liturgy is. ritual provides structure in society... good rituals and bad rituals alike. well, this is a bad one. your point of view. well, it should be the point of view of any reasonably intelligent, middle-aged person. unfortunately, it is not. i'll, uh... see you later, mother. excuse me. thank you. you're going back. do you believe that i love you? i do, you know. but, finally, if that is my only reason to stay alive... it's not enough. almost. almost, but not quite. i can't be that selfish, lwaxana. i am not the person to lead the revolt. i do apologize for all the turmoil that i've created. doctor, i would deeply regret it if you were returning only to ease diplomatic tensions. it is more... much more. then i wish you and your people well. when it is time for another test i will encourage my people to seek your assistance again. if for any reason you would like to wait for a few minutes... no, we have already said our good-byes. lwaxana. it is the custom for your loved ones to join you at this resolution, is it not? you do not have to do this. yes, i do. permission to disembark, captain? i promise i won't cause any problems down there. permission granted. we are ready, mr. o'brien."

no. open up the transporters on cargo bay two. divert everyone from deck seven to put it on track. all engineering personnel are requested to report to...  captain! the arkaria base does not have the units i requested. i have living tissue samples that won't survive the baryon sweep. i've tried to reason with them. have la forge transport a stasis unit from astrophysics. you can convert it to store samples. thank you, captain. all science personnel.  please check in with your section chief for duty assignment.  i'm heading to deck seven. the auto-shutdown is on hold until we're back on schedule. resume the sequence. troi has taken care of the situation. - captain. - bridge. it has been quite a day. has it not? yes, it has. however, a change of routine is often invigorating and a welcome diversion after a long assignment. exactly. i understand that arkaria has very interesting weather patterns. - mr data, are you alright? - yes, sir. i am filling a silent moment with non-relevant conversation. - small talk. - yes, sir. i find that humans often use small talk during awkward moments. therefore, i have written a new subroutine for that purpose. how did i do? perhaps it was a little too non-relevant. but if you really are interested in small talk, keep your eye on cmdr hutchinson at the reception this afternoon. he's a master. thank you, sir. i will. - captain. - captain. - after you. - no, after you. - i believe you spoke first. - gentlemen! mr worf? the computer needs your authorisation to disable command functions. - are we ready? - almost. i requested two field diverters for the core and the bridge. - they haven't been installed. - additional units? yes, sir. we've logged so many warp hours that our baryon levels are high. i'm concerned that when the remmler array sweeps the ship, it will have to use a stronger beam than normal. it might overload the field converters protecting our systems. how long till new ones are in place? - about 20 minutes. - very well. computer, disable all command functions in 30 minutes. authorisation, picard, gamma 6073. authorisation acknowledged.  captain, incoming message. it's the station administrator, mr orton. - in my ready room. - captain. request permission to be excused from cmdr hutchinson's reception. permission granted. i wish i could excuse myself as well. permission to... mr la forge, i cannot excuse my entire senior staff! mr worf beat you to it. go ahead. if you're on schedule,  i'd like to confirm that we'll begin the baryon sweep at 1500 hours, one hour from now.  confirmed. cmdr hutchinson also wanted me to make sure that you will attend his reception this afternoon.  tell him... i'm looking forward to it. he'll be delighted to hear that.  arkaria base out.  tell arkaria we're almost finished. we need two more conduits. - i need to run a diagnostic. - get the diverter aligned. where's the odn interface?

- good to see you again. - it's been too long. four years! now, i want to hear about everything after starfleet medical. and i have so much to tell you! that must be cmdr riker! - excuse me. - of course. pardon me. - you must be will riker. - i must be. calvin hutchinson. call me hutch. calvin, awful name. i've never forgiven my parents. soon as i saw you, i knew you were the first officer. of course. your reputation precedes you! flashing blue eyes, square jaw. quite the ladies' man. don't be modest, will. - may i call you will? - sure. i also hear that you're a musician. i hope you'll play something. it's not often we entertain the command crew of the flagship. and speaking of command! - hello, capt picard. - commander. i was just saying what a pleasure it is to have you here. - how are you? - very well, thank you. it is very good to see you both again! beverly! may i call you beverly? have you noticed that the mean temperature here on arkaria is slightly higher than normal for human comfort-levels? i have found that humans prefer a body temperature of 21 °c in order to operate most efficiently. however, there are several cultures who actually prefer that their temperature is identical to the room in which they are standing. the sheliak. i am telling you, you have never seen anything like this. there were thousands of them. the northern sky turned dark. geordi, deanna. i don't think you have met our host. this is lt cmdr geordi la forge. counsellor deanna troi. - this is cmdr hutchinson. - call me hutch. i was just telling your captain about the sights on arkaria. are you interested in ornithology? well... the mating habits of the arkarian horn fowl are interesting. if the weather were better, we could take horses to their nests. - horses? - yes. we have trails through the plains. unfortunately, it's not pleasant now. cold, muddy. - not a soul for kilometres. - perfect. mr la forge, how long before the baryon sweep? about 25 minutes. - i have time to get my saddle. - your saddle? yes. a saddle is a very personal thing. it has to be broken in, used, cared for. you keep a saddle on board the enterprise? yes, for when i have the opportunity to ride. - i see. - it's normal. most serious riders do have their own saddles. - of course. - absolutely! well, if you will excuse me... amazing man. he reminds me of another officer i knew years ago. a capt edwell. he was fascinating. born on gaspar vll, but you wouldn't know it. auto-shutdown in progress.  defensive systems off line.  baryon sweep begins in eight minutes.  what are you doing? someone left this odn junction box open. i thought you were supposed to be off the ship. the diverters have to be synchronised. i was laser-bonding a backup. i see. i'd better let you finish up so that you can get off. excuse me a minute. auto-shutdown sequence in progress.  primary power off line in one minute.  - we need to bypass the conduit. - that's on deck 30. get pomet started on it right away. primary power off line in 30 seconds.  final warning. primary power off line in ten seconds.  yes. i find it fascinating that your family dropped the prefix pel from your surname. it was my understanding that pel orton is a more noble appellation than orton. yes. perhaps the recent trend toward an egalitarian society is responsible. perhaps. the crew of the magellan put on a talent show here. capt conklin did a poetry reading. imagine that. - i'm trying to. - did i tell you how i came here? i was serving on admiral mitchell's staff on starbase 97. - awful place. - have you met our cmdr data? as a matter of fact, i find it oddly amusing! - no, i don't think so. - come on. i'll introduce you. several cultures have extremely similar etymological histories. mr data, have you had a chance to meet cmdr hutchinson? - call me hutch. - our second officer. - a pleasure. - the pleasure is mine, hutch. i want to compliment you on your choice of colours. you really think so? it wasn't easy, making a final decision. i can imagine. the light would make colour selection problematic. precisely! - thank you. - you're welcome. - i'm not sure who to feel sorry for. - mr orton? you'll excuse me, commander? - geordi, where's the captain? - he went back to get his saddle. his saddle? any serious rider would have his own saddle. he's probably ten kilometres from here already. lucky him! thank you. kelsey to devor.  kelsey to devor devor, this is kelsey. reply.  devor, do you read me?  - kelsey to kiros.  - this is kiros.  devor isn't responding there must be too much interference.  go find him.  see if he's finished on deck seven.  - meet us in main engineering.  - understood.  who are you? what are you doing on my ship? the baryon sweep uses a high-frequency plasma field. your phaser won't work. you're probably right. but i'd like to bet this will. a laser welder can be deadly. now, what's going on in main engineering? i suggest that you cooperate. you're starfleet. you won't kill me. you sure? seems you're right. tyrellian laser art is very similar in form and composition. of course! i used to be stationed on tyrellia. really? there are five tyrellians serving aboard the enterprise. fascinating. not many people know this. tyrellia is only one of three known inhabited planets - without a magnetic pole. - i was aware of that. are you aware that tyrellia is one of seven known planets with no atmosphere? really? - they're still at it! - non-stop. it has a strange fascination. how long can two people talk about nothing? is something wrong? i don't know. i got strange energy readings from your table. i'm sure it's not serious. perhaps the heating is malfunctioning. maybe i should look. i'm sure we can handle this, commander. there's no need to concern yourself. maybe i should look at the element. it's alright. please, don't worry. what was that all about? i assure you it's alright. we'll look into it. you don't have to concern yourself. orton, now! what is going on? stay right where you are. reduce the plasma pressure to 0.6 percent nominal. 0.6. - how does the conduit look? - it's clear. alright. the plasma flow has been shunted to the aft conduit. we're ready here. ok, that should do it, i think. be sure, neil. yes. yeah, that does it. alright! transfer 500 milligrams from the reserve system to the core. - perfect! - adequate. disable the overrides. get the interlocks off the seal. pomet! prepare the transport assembly. keep watching that power flow. it might... keep working! - where did he come from? - deck seven. - who are you? - my name is mot. - i'm the barber. - barber? what are you doing here? everyone was evacuated to the surface. yes, i know. but i wanted to ride. i didn't have my saddle... - your saddle? - that's right. it's on deck seven. the power went out and i got lost... alright! shut up. just shut up! - any sign of devor? - no. satler. get down here and keep an eye on our barber. go see if you can find devor. make sure nothing's wrong. sit down. alright. just don't point that thing at me. do what i tell you. you won't have to worry. - how long until you're ready? - 40, maybe 50 minutes. the baryon sweep hits in 30 minutes. - the diverter will protect us. - i'm worried about that unit. i want the trilithium resin in there before the sweep gets here. - i don't want to take chances. - understood. they haven't tried to communicate with the outside. no demands, no political statements, no theft. they must want something. orton is not as calm as he looks. he's agitated and nervous. as if something's gone wrong. maybe geordi upset their timetable when he saw the hidden weapons. orton may be improvising. maybe he didn't plan on hostages and doesn't know what to do. if they do not have a plan, we may have the initiative. maybe, but we need to figure out how to use it. how is he? there's no permanent damage. i've adjusted the optical transducer in his visor to block out some of the pain. it's only partially effective. i need to get him to a medical facility. i doubt if they'll agree to that. but maybe if we tell them geordi's dying, they would give us access to a medical kit. we might be able to use the tools to make a weapon. perhaps we can use the visor as a weapon. if the optical transducer were modified, we might be able to generate a hypersonic pulse. a hypersonic pulse would overload the audio receptors of everyone. it would cause immediate unconsciousness. can you adjust the visor yourself? it will look suspicious if you both work on it. i'll try. i might need geordi to help me through. alright. be as casual as you can. let me know when you're ready. ready. begin draining the trilithium at 100 milligrams per minute. neil, what's going on? neil, get over here. put that down. don't worry. i've got it. i'll be right there. the primary inducer is fused. there's no way to fix it. with no diverter, we have no protection from the baryon sweep. i know that. how long before the baryon sweep gets here? about 12 minutes. we should go to ten-forward. that's the last place that will be swept by the baryon field. alright, we're leaving. we're taking the trilithium with us. what? do you know how volatile trilithium is? we can't just start hauling it through the ship! i'll... i'll try to make some modifications. satler's dead. he ran into the baryon sweep. - what about mot? - i don't know. i don't think he's a barber. i found this in the jefferies tube. kelsey to kiros.  this is kiros.  we have a problem.  there's a starfleet officer still aboard.  he's killed satler and maybe devor.  he destroyed the diverter in engineering.  we have to leave before the baryon sweep enters.  - what about the trilithium resin?  - we're taking it to ten-forward.  kelsey, don't be a fool. you know better than to move trilithium resin.  mr mot! or should i call you lieutenant? lieutenant commander, perhaps? call me what you wish.  moving trilithium requires specific equipment. you can't just improvise. i wouldn't need to improvise if you hadn't damaged our diverter. if you're so concerned, i suggest you stop interfering with us, before you set off an explosion that destroys the enterprise. and you. i would rather destroy the ship than give the resin to terrorists. what makes you think i am a terrorist? trilithium resin is a toxic waste- product produced by our engines. its only use is as a weapon.  you might be right, but we have been planning for this for a long time. i doubt you'll be able to stop us. find him! or even slow us down. there. 300 milligrams of trilithium. i'm using a dynamic stabiliser to act as a control rod. that should keep the resin stable enough for transport. come on! don't be so tense. if something goes wrong, you won't have time to worry about it. three more decks, then we take corridor 15b to ten-forward. - what's wrong? - we have to find another way up. the rungs are cut. that wasn't very clever, mr mot.  if you knew where we were, you should have attacked. now we'll take a route, one you might not be able to predict. there are only so many ways to ten-forward. ten-forward is the logical place to stay ahead of the sweep. that sweep is just as big a threat to you as it is to us. in fact, if i were you, mr mot, i'd be trying to find another way off this ship.  i plan on leaving the same way you do. on your ship. - what ship? - come on, kelsey.  you've been planning this. you must have a way to get off the enterprise and leave this system. i think a ship is coming for you. i plan to be on it. it's a small ship, mr mot. i don't think there's room for both of us. i'm sorry to hear that. i'll send your regrets. how is he, doctor? he's in a lot of pain but i think he should be fine. he needs some water. is that alright? we're almost ready. when we set the visor to emit the pulse, there'll be a burst of light. we need a distraction. - they need a distraction. - how long? just a few seconds. i think i can distract orton for a few seconds. i don't think orton's in a talking mood, will. you just have to know how to talk to him. orton. i think we need to discuss the situation. there is nothing to discuss. sit down. there's a lot to discuss. be reasonable. i am not interested in hearing your hostage-negotiation tactics. it can't hurt you to listen, can it? - alright. - thank you. now, the first thing we need to discuss is this... hold it. put your weapon down. kelsey, this is kiros. i'm on deck ten. i have mot. - is he alive? - yes.  good. meet us at intersection 41. understood.  this way. give me the trilithium. how much farther do we have to go? not far. with all the modifications you've made to this unit, will we have problems removing the trilithium? no. just remove the control rod, drain the unit. there shouldn't be any problem. that's all i wanted to know. well! not as clever as you thought. - where's pomet? - he shot him with an arrow. - he's not dead. - he will be soon. the sweep's nearly here. no time to go back. - what about neil? - the sweep got him. let's go. i thought you'd just talk to him. i did. he just didn't like what i had to say. that was a perimeter warning from the remmler array. a small ship is approaching. mr orton has dropped his shields. this must be the sign. mr data, you will be the only one unaffected by the burst. as soon as everyone else is unconscious, i need you to get to that computer and stop that ship somehow. i will try, sir. now. kelsey, perhaps we can work out a deal. you're the one who needs a deal, mot. my name isn't mot. it's jean-luc picard. capt picard, this is all beginning to make sense. leave the trilithium. take me with you as a hostage. i am not a terrorist, i have no political agenda, although i know some people who do have agendas. and they are very interested in this little container. profit. this is all about profit. i prefer to think of it as commerce. open the door. now, go through slowly. well, picard, i guess i'll be the one to send your regrets. picard to arkaria base. deactivate the baryon sweep. arkaria base. this is capt picard on board the enterprise. deactivate the baryon sweep! arkaria base. this is capt picard. deactivate the baryon sweep immediately! data to capt picard.  do you read me, sir?  - picard here. - are you alright, captain? yes, mr data. a scout ship has just beamed someone off the enterprise. do you know anything about it?  i know they won't get far. hold still. you have a nasty cut here. any luck? sorry, captain. i don't know what happened to it. hold still! i can't heal this if you don't stop fidgeting. security has searched deck seven. they found nothing. there. i found it. someone put it in a maintenance locker. - thank you. - you keep a saddle on board? mr worf, i'm surprised. anyone who is an experienced rider has his own saddle. - it's perfectly normal. - actually, it came in handy. i only wish i'd been able to use it on a horse. of course.

0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"good evening, fellow realtors and clients. i'm very anxious to call your attention to the investment possibilities of our new subdivision, pitted hills. naturally, it lacks certain other luxuries, but this is the price one pays for getting in on the ground floor. the sewers are not yet in. however, there are enough craters to go around. as for its lack of atmosphere and water, i don't expect that to deter those of you with a real pioneer spirit. those of you with vision can, i'm sure, imagine the beautiful sight of the moon completely covered with the well-known inexpensive hitchcock homes, all with picture windows giving everyone an unobscured view of his neighbor's picture window. naturally, each home would be individualized. there are seven different models to choose from. seven, mind you. red, green, blue, orange, lemon, lime and the ever-popular chartreuse. for those of you who are budget-minded, we do have cheaper lots in the upper area. very fine, of course, if you like a lot that completely disappears at half moon. like our prologue, tonight's story touches on real estate. it begins immediately after this brief advertisement. sally... yes, mr. hacker? seems like we've got a customer. think we ought to act busy? sure. what should i type? anything. write a letter to your boyfriend if you like. well, that's silly. he's right across the street. now, just type what i just dictated in... mr. hacker? yes, sir. something i can do for you? might be, if i can find the right kind of house. well, you've come to the right place. would you sit down, mr... waterbury. hot today. almost as bad as the city. yes, it's unusually hot for around here. doesn't usually get this hot. mean temperature's around 78 in the summer. isn't that right, sally? sally! cut out that darn racket. yes, mr. hacker. now, then. how'd you happen to see my ad in the times? no. i take one every week. lots of city people interested in a town like ours. you'd be surprised how much business i didn't see it. you didn't? nope. oh. i just happened to be passing through. i remembered the town. i used to drive through here on my way to albany. before i retired. always thought i'd like to settle down here someday. ah, you couldn't do any better. it's a nice little town. i've got some real fine listings here. well, i've already seen a place well, it's a little run-down, but a fella could have a lot of fun fixing it up if he didn't have anything else to do. did it have a realtor's sign on it? yes, yours. oh. it's that old house down at the end of elm street. that place... old sadie grimes' house? well, what is it? what's the matter with the place? well, it's not in very good condition. now, if you really like this town, if you're serious about settling down here, i got any number of places that'd suit you much better. now, you look here, hacker. i think i know better than you what kind of a place would suit me. i'm interested in that old house. do you want to sell it to me or don't you? oh, yes! yes, i'd like to move it, all right. it's been on my books for five years. how much you think that place is worth, you name the price, hacker, then we'll see. oh, i'm not dickering with you. i'd just like to know how much you figure i don't know... nine thousand maybe. 9,500, tops. well, you're not far wrong. but that isn't what mrs. grimes is asking. what does she want? $50,000. 50! what is this? a joke? i wish it was. do you know how many buyers i've had for that place in the last five years? seven! she ought to know she could never get she must be cracked. maybe. sadie's had her share of troubles. lost her youngest boy a few years back. if you'd be interested in anything else, mr. waterbury. no, no, i don't think so. i kind of liked that old house. i don't know, it just seemed like the right do you think maybe if i went out and talked to her? you'd be wasting your time, i've been trying for five years. but maybe if somebody else tried, she might listen to reason from an outsider. well, if you want to take the trouble, it's worth the try. sally, call old sadie and tell her mr. waterbury's on his way out. yes, mr. hacker. thanks. good luck. yes. afternoon, ma'am. oh, aaron hacker said you were coming. aaron mumbles so... waterbury. well, now you're here, i suppose you thank you. mighty hot today. well, it's cool in here 'cause i keep the door shut. now, if you've come here to bargain you might as well save your breath, because i've set a price and i don't intend to budge. so i understand. but i thought we might just talk a little. talk's free. but if you're not interested in my house at my price, there's nothing to talk about. ah, i wouldn't be here at all if i wasn't interested. very well. sit down. mrs. grimes, your real estate agent says... oh, aaron hacker's a fool. he keeps sending people around to argue with me. i'm too old for changing my mind. i know, i'm getting along myself, mrs. grimes. retired a few months ago. i made a fair amount of money in my time and now i'm getting ready to settle down. so i started to look around for why did you choose lvy corners? oh, i don't know. always liked the place. then you've been here before? i passed through here many times when i was on the road. a salesman. well, i thought i'd come up here today town looked as good as i remembered. so i decided right then and there that this was the town and this was the house. why? how do you explain a thing like that? it just seemed like the right kind of house for me. i like it, too. that's why i'm asking a fair price for it. fair price? now, mrs. grimes, a house like this shouldn't cost more than 9,000, 10,000. that's enough. i told you i wouldn't argue. but mrs. grimes... if you're not interested in my house at my price, there's nothing more to be said. now, wait a minute... good day, mr. waterbury. look, i didn't say i wouldn't pay your price, did i? after all, i can afford it. i've got plenty of money now. why shouldn't i enjoy myself? i worked a good many years to get it and i've got nobody to leave it to. you don't have a family, mr. waterbury? no, no, i'm all alone in the world. my wife died a good many years ago. i've got nobody to account to except myself. you know, i've got a darn good notion the telephone is right there. why don't you call aaron hacker by george, i'll do it! i've got some lemonade in the icebox. while you're drinking it i'll tell you the history of this house. fine. i could stand something cold. i'll get it. that's 4121. four, 1,2,1. aaron hacker, realtor. one moment. it's mr. waterbury. mr. waterbury? well, i've still got some mighty you what? well, how much did she come down? you wouldn't be pulling my leg, would you? oh, no! no, i think it's fine. real fine. congratulations, mr. waterbury. goodbye. he's paying 50,000 for that old wreck. she must have hypnotized him. well, sir, this house has been in my family since 1872. thank you. all my children were born here in the upstairs bedroom. all except michael. he was the youngest. he was born in the new hospital. i guess he was my favorite. anyway, everybody says i spoiled him. this is his picture. he's a fine-looking young man. yes, he was handsome. black hair, dark eyes, he was full of high spirits. he was not like the others. they were all steady, reliable. got married, raised families, bought homes. but michael was different. he had big dreams, ambition. he couldn't wait to leave lvy corners and go to the city. i know, i was exactly the same when i was young. i didn't see him for nine years. but he did very well in the city, and regular as clockwork, every month, there'd be a check in the mail for me. not that the money didn't come in handy, but mostly it was because michael had sent it. mr. hacker mentioned something about him. yes, you can't have secrets in a small town. everybody knows michael got into some kind of trouble. he never told me what it was, but i knew from the moment i saw him, that something was wrong. he came home in the middle of the night. the knocker woke me up and i knew it was michael even before i got downstairs. it's not unusual. i can't explain it, but a mother frequently i knew michael had come home. ma... michael! close the door, ma. i don't want the whole oh. oh, why didn't you let me know you were coming? are you hungry? i'll get you don't bother. i ate on the road you're thin. you've been working too hard. you're not sick, are you? no, i'm just beat, that's all. i've been on the road since yesterday morning. michael. what's wrong? wrong? there isn't anything wrong. i got fed up with my job, so i quit, that's all. i needed a rest, so i thought i'd come anything wrong in that? oh, i'm glad. go on back to bed, ma. we'll have plenty of time to talk about it. i'm gonna be around for a few weeks. give me that! what do you think you're doing? well, i was going to unpack it for you. oh, well... these aren't my clothes, ma. i had everything shipped on ahead. should be here tomorrow or the next day. these are just some things i cleaned out if you want to know the truth, ma, oh, i'm sorry, ma. maybe that's why i'm so jumpy. don't pay any attention to me. i'll be all right after i get a good night, dear. good night, ma. nothing more was ever said about that little black bag and i don't know what michael did with it. i never saw it again. you know, mrs. grimes, i think i'm beginning you set such a high price on this house. after all, you've lived here all your life, your children grew up here... it must hold a lot of memories for you. yes, memories. happy ones and sad ones. i never had a family myself. missed a lot in life, i suppose, but maybe i was spared a lot, too. just how much did aaron hacker nothing. but he just mentioned that you'd lost him about five years ago. he didn't explain what he meant by it. well, you won't live here long before you hear it from somebody. so you might as well hear it from me. michael stayed at home that whole summer. never went out any further than the front porch. that wasn't like him. he was always on the go when he lived at home before, so i knew there was something bothering him. but there was no use questioning him about it. if he was going to tell me, he'd do it in the rest was good for him. he got back some of his weight and his nerves were better. he was much more like his old self. and i was happy as a mother could be, then one night, it ended. hello, mike. i told you once and i'll tell you again. it wasn't me. i didn't get it. i don't know who did. you can take it or leave it. where is it, punk? i haven't got it! michael! michael? michael! michael! michael! oh, michael. i'm sorry i have to burst in on you at a time like this, but i got to. it's all right, joe. sit down. oh, this is detective sergeant singer, how do you do, mrs. grimes? seemed like a real nice funeral, sadie. over half the townsfolk turned out. mike had a lot of friends. curiosity. that's what brought them out. yeah, i guess so. sadie, you're gonna have to i hate to be the one to tell you, but i guess it's up to me. mike got himself into a lot of trouble in new york. yes? serious trouble. him and three other fellas held up a bank and stole over $200,000. the way it looks now, mike made off with all the money and came back here to hide out. one of the gang found out where he was and came here to get his share. now, from what you told me the night he was shot, mike wouldn't hand it over. i never told you anything of the kind, joe taylor. i said mike told the man he didn't have it. so you did. well, that's why sergeant singer is here from new york. i guess you'd better take it on from here. mrs. grimes, it's my job to find that money and to return it to the bank. i think you can help us. who is going to find the man who killed my son? chief taylor is working on that. now, we are, too, to a certain extent, but the murder is out of our jurisdiction. now, did you ever see the money? no. did your son ever say or do anything that would indicate he had the money? no. you think maybe it's hidden somewhere in the house? i don't know. have you looked for it? why should i look for the money? i don't want the money. i only want the man who killed my boy. now, sadie, we're doing everything we can. you know we don't have much to work on. if you'd just gotten a look at him. i heard his voice, that was all. mrs. grimes, when the bank was robbed the loot was carried away in a small black bag. it might have been transferred into something else, but then again it might not have been. do you recall whether your son ever had such a bag? well, do you, mrs. grimes? no. you never saw a small black bag in this house? i never saw it. that was five years ago. i buried my boy and then i put this house up for sale. for $50,000. it's a strange story, mrs. grimes. i'm glad you told it to me. i had my own reasons for telling you. i need advice. mr. waterbury, you're a business man. do you think the bank will accept $50,000 why shouldn't they? it's a bird in the hand. but it's only a quarter of what michael stole. well, i don't imagine they expected to get any of it back. they probably wrote it off years ago. very well, then. that's settled. have you had any more trouble from the police? the police? well, you did lie to them about the stolen money. i said i never saw that money. you told them you never saw a little black bag, either. but you told me michael had one the night he came home. yes, i lied. michael hid that little black bag somewhere in this house. to this day i don't know where. i never tried to find it. i left it for the man who killed my son to come back and get it. how could you tell? you said you never saw him. i didn't. that's why i put this old house up for sale for $50,000. only someone who knew there was $200,000 hidden here would pay five times what this old place is worth. and that person would be the man who killed my boy. i see... very clever of you, mrs. grimes. i don't think it took cleverness. just patience. i knew someday you'd come back to get the money. all i had to do was wait until i could find a man who was willing to pay too much for an old house. and now i suppose you'll phone the police. yes, i'll phone the police. i don't see how i can let you do that. if you'd been smart, mrs. grimes, you'd have phoned them before you told me the story. mr. waterbury, i didn't tell you the story until after you drank your lemonade. poison. enough to kill you three times over. aaron, this is sadie grimes. you can put my house back on your books. mr. waterbury has decided not to buy it after all. so much for life in these united states. unfortunately, mrs. grimes' crime... mrs. grimes' crime was discovered and her reputation ruined. prior to this, she had never been known to make a bad glass of lemonade. prices have gone sky-high on the moon, so i'm seeking land that isn't so close in. i think i shall have a look at venus. most of you seem too young, however, so i think you should look at something more wholesome. i suggest the following, after which i hope you'll rejoin me. very dull. i couldn't see anything but a planet. i might as well have looked at the commercial, a practice i may take up at our next meeting. until then, good night."

- no, thanks. hi, joe. - girl... - hi, raven. you know something, honey? if i had a dollar for every time you stood in the mirror admiring your face... i could get off these streets and retire to the bahamas. this face is my meal ticket, honey. i'm cold. let's go get some coffee. i don't know about you, but my shit's always hot. oh, god, here comes mr. trouble. - hey, baby, how's business?

let's make a fucking deal? give it. - or don't you see where i'm at? - yeah, i see where you're at. here, just be cool. like i said, strictly business. you're freelance now, honey. no shit. where'd you say you got this stuff? an acquaintance had a little accident. - truck ran over his head. - yeah? you bastard. you stole it! i didn't know you was a teen idol. so how does this work? i got two months or something to redeem my stuff? you got four months. plus 12% if i was gonna take it. what's that supposed to mean? it means that if this watch was any hotter, i'd have burned a hole in my hand. i mean a guy needs asbestos gloves, some of the shit that people bring in here. what are you talking about? that's a $15,000 watch. look at the diamonds. it's hot, is what it is. you could fry a big old egg on the son of a bitch. i don't want to buy your jewelry. i ain't buying your jewelry or your bullshit story. - now, get out of here. - fuck you. no. wait. i thought you weren't interested. i ain't interested in them things. but i can see you got something that's worth a whole lot more. sorry, old man, i just retired from that business. no. i'm not talking about that. i'm talking about your beauty. my beauty. silly me, what was i thinking? god. you wait. $10,000. cash. let me get this straight. for $10,000, you make a mold of my face? not your face. your beauty. yeah, right. and i got four months to redeem my beauty if want it back. that's right. you know something, old man, there are people who play with a full deck... then there's you. now, you hold still now. i hope you ain't claustrophobic. almost time, my love. pretty soon you'll be back with me. you'll look just like you did before... like the day we were married. welcome to the party. okay. bye. - hello. - hello yourself. all this yours? - life's tough. - i get by. i don't wanna tear you away from your guests. i saw you and, let's just say, something more important came up. sounds like a cheap sexual innuendo to me. well, i'm sorry. it's supposed to sound like an expensive one. you don't think it's rude to leave your date to go make a pass at another woman? who's making a pass? we haven't even met yet. true. i'm sylvia vane. that's v-a-n-e, as in ""weather."" i'm ronnie price, as in ""everyone has theirs."" don't look now, but i think miss clairol might be getting the wrong idea. i was kinda hoping the wrong idea might become the right idea. - what are you, a psycho? - just playing hard to get. isn't it rude to slap the host and leave without saying goodbye? thank you very much, mr. price. you have a lovely apartment. good night. wait. i don't know the first thing about you. - at least tell me why you came. - i haven't yet. look. we're both playing games. you know it and i know it. truth is, you do know the first thing about me. you knew the second i walked in the room and through that door... that i'm the girl of your dreams, right? you wanna get out of here? i thought you'd never ask. - it's gorgeous. - nope. correction. you are gorgeous. it's just real expensive jewelry. listen, i've been thinking. remember what you said the night we met? that ""girl of my dreams"" stuff? let me tell you a little secret. you weren't lying, even a little bit. yeah, that's it. listen, i'll only be gone a couple of days. probably end up sitting on the company jet, signing papers. if i'm real lucky, i'll get to watch some fat texans get drunk. won't that be exciting? - sweetheart, are you okay? - i just dropped something. what is this, the makeup counter at macy's? you're a knockout. what do you need all this junk for? i don't know. i got an acne flare-up or something. i feel like i'm in high school. when i get back from my trip, we can go to the prom. what do you say? sweetheart? what, are you playing hard to get again? come on, zit face, give me a kiss goodbye. please, sit down. it does not appear to be cancer. i think we can say that, first off. and i think we can also safely eliminate any pituitary disorder... specifically acromegalia, which, frankly, was my initial concern. your medical record doesn't indicate... any history of reconstructive surgery. is that true? - what are you calling me, a liar? - no. of course not. it's just that silicon injections, implants... that kind of procedure can sometimes result in the types of symptoms... that you are displaying now. that's all. you see, as i explained before, dermatology is my specialty... and your problem could be glandular. but there are a lot of specialists that i could recommend. look, all i want is a simple answer to a simple question. what is happening to my face? - you're under a great deal of stress. - you figured that out. look at me! forty-eight hours ago, i could have had any man i wanted. now i can't even get arrested. i'm 21 years old. what am i gonna look like tomorrow? miss vane, if you'll just sit here for a moment, i will attempt... to explain this to you. frankly... your skin... seems to be aging at an accelerating rate. now this does not mean that the situation is irreversible... but it's very important for you to try to think back... to any time, let's say within the last six months or so... when you might have come in contact with a toxic material... for example, contaminated water or gases... radiation, anything out of the ordinary, which... could have caused this. miss vane? get out of here. don't do business with this man. i want it back. here's my ticket and $10,000 plus 12%. you didn't look at this too careful, did you? i told you the time limit was four months. four months from this date is the fourth. today's the fifth. - you son of a bitch. - i'm sorry. - okay. how much? - you missed the deadline, lady. i know i missed the fucking deadline. if you want to mark it up, mark it up! just tell me how much. $100,000. hey, joe. - how's tricks? - hey, mac. ma'am. - four bits you owe me. - yeah. must be alpo time. where's the fucking money? what's going on? - who are you? - ronnie. how do you know my name? now just don't move, i'm calling the police. - 911 emergency. - yeah, i'd like to report a burglary. - go ahead. - yeah, the address is... are you there? what's your location, sir? sir, can you hear me? - who are you? - don't you recognize me, lover? i'm the girl of your dreams. shit. that's the way she used to look. she used to be so beautiful. now i need other women's beauty just to keep her that way. small price to pay, i think. look, i don't know what kind of crazy, voodoo shit you're into... and i don't really care, but we had a deal, man. look. all that's worth more than $100,000. now i want it back! give it back to me. i want my beauty back. sure. i could do that. i could give you your beauty back... if that's what you really want. hey, joe? hey, mac. how's tricks? - did you read that story in the paper? - yeah, i looked it over. classic. dumb broad. she stole every scrap of jewelry the guy bought for her. then she offs the guy, leaves the murder weapon on the floor. do you believe it? - were her fingerprints on the gun? - not only that. they're already on record from a soliciting rap last year. we're not talking rocket scientist here. the second she shows her face anywhere, it's a one-way trip to the electric chair. hell of a face, too. with a face like that, who needs brains? why don't you watch where you're going, you old, ugly, trifling bitch? poor sylvia, eh, kiddies? guess she heard the old saying, ""if looks could kill..."" so she did. just goes to show you, if you want to sell yourself... take a look in the mirror first. see you next time, boys and ghouls. english"
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"oh, oh, good evening. i was just about to send greetings to an old friend. i'm sure martin's civilized methods of homicide... are much more efficient, but i don't care for them. i abhor violence. that is why on this program... we use stabbings, shooting and garrotings... only when they are absolutely essential to the plot... or when the whim strikes us. tonight's play begins in a museum. and the title is the cheney vase. that's all i intend to tell you. you'll have to figure the rest out for yourselves. i don't intend to discuss it any further. i want you to leave the museum this afternoon. mr. koether, the work i did here as your assistant... could be done by a reasonably intelligent child. leaving won't be exactly a hardship. however, you're rather conveniently forgetting my severance pay. if you want to make an issue of the money, lyle... i'll be glad to take it up with the board. i'm prepared to go completely into your record... during the three months you've been here. your inability to arrive even approximately on time. the four days off last month, with no reason whatsoever. it was spring, mr. koether. though i doubt whether you were aware of that. i want you out of this building by 3:00. yes, sir. how'd it go, lyle? it went and so shall i. oh, no, what are you going to do? you got me this job, you got any other ideas? let me go. mr. endicott! miss cheney, no one told me you were in the museum. frances and i just arrived. now, aren't you looking chipper, if i may say so. well, of course you may say so. everyone lies to me and spoils me. i'd rather be put out, if they didn't. but the only thing chipper about my appearance... is perhaps my suit. and if you had known me longer, mr. endicott... you'd know that that's almost as old as you are. well, it's still very handsome, and so is its owner. but now, doesn't this add a touch of color? there we go. it's very thoughtful of you, mr. endicott. thank you. you're not gonna run off... with one of the museum's treasures in that box, are you? no, this is- this is my own last little effort. frances, why don't you run along and do your errands? i shan't need you for a while. well, now, you know, it's really very good. you've cut this in here beautifully. yeah. well, of course... it's only a hobby, but... at least no one can say that i completely waste my time... rattling around in that old house out in the country. there you are, herbert. good afternoon, martha. what a nice surprise. i didn't expect you till wednesday. it was the only day i could come. have you taken care of that matter, as i asked you to? yes, i'll take care of that immediately, mr. koether. miss cheney, it was so nice to see you again. goodbye, mr. endicott. goodbye. what did you want to see me about? martha, i'm leaving for the coast. are you really? day after tomorrow. martha, it would be a wonderful send-off for my trip... if i could inform the board of trustees that at long last... i've arranged to purchase the cheney vase. now, you're not still at it? no, herbert, you know i could never sell it. it was the last thing of my father's, and i'll keep it as long as i live... and that's going to be a long, long time. but, martha, you always promised. no, herbert... that's final. so, you're leaving for the coast? frances is leaving me, too. so i have to manage without frances. this will probably be my last visit, for a while. so act like a curator, herbert. i'd like to see those chinese figurines... no explanation, no nothing. he just fired you. darling, i'm sick. what is it with us? do we just have the unlucky touch? other people get married, save money and have babies. think that this is the best of all possible worlds. why not just once... just once can something work out right for me? will they let you stay in your apartment until i get my check? i'm not gonna take any more money from you. take a letter, miss waring. what? of recommendation. at least you can type one, i think... even if our distinguished curator won't feel obliged to. what will i say? just write a nice, kind enthusiastic letter. lyle endicott worked here at the manhattan museum of art... as my assistant until may 12... during which time, he turned out to be a very dependable worker. i hope you don't mind my coming to you. but, you see, i'm in no position financially to engage someone like you. there could be other compensations in my case. you see, i could continue my research here in your wonderful library. may i? thank you, mr. endicott. call me lyle. well, i... look, if i'm going to be taking care of you... you can hardly go around calling me mister, now, can you? it was very kind of you and herbert to think of me... but you know that when frances leaves, there'll just be bella, the cook... and i'm helpless since my illness last year. i can't get around at all. then you need a man around the house... now, don't you? well... would you be willing to put it on a trial basis? say, one month? of course. i know that i won't change my mind. well. then let's seal the bargain, lyle. would you like another cup of tea, dear? sitting here gossiping with you isn't going to get any work done. and i ought to have been in my studio an hour ago. we certainly can't let talent go to waste, now, can we? here we go. whee! oh, no. lyle. there. oh, no, please. there. really. now, you go on upstairs and get to work... and i'll make all the arrangements about lunch. you're not supposed to bother about things like that. why not? i enjoy doing things for you. there we go. oh, lyle. put those somewhere. i'll answer them later. okay. yes, sir. bella, would you clear up miss cheney's tea things, will you? yes, sir. but, bella, it isn't important... one cup, and you so rarely break anything. miss cheney, i didn't break it. now, as mr. endicott said: ""it wasn't broken when i had my tea from it... ""and you're the only one who's touched the tray since."" if you cracked a cup, there's no harm in admitting it... but don't try to blame someone else. are you calling me a liar, sir? i'm saying that when one is as old as you are, and is prone to breaking- bella, i know you're tired. you've had too much to do since frances left. so why don't you go and lie down for a little while. never thought the time would come you wouldn't believe me, miss cheney. i can see i'm not wanted in this house. bella, wait. bella. i'm afraid we hurt her feelings. i hated having to worry you about this... but some of the things that've gone on lately... bella has been with me for 18, almost 20 years. i couldn't possibly do without her. i hope she'll stay with me as long as i live. i just thought perhaps... she might need a little vacation. why don't you tell her to take a couple of weeks off? i'm sure i can take care of you. well. so, this is where the artist creates her masterpieces? it's a good place for work. it's quiet, it's soundproof. when the elevator's downstairs, i feel cut off from the rest of the world. do you keep the vase up here? what vase? the vase. there's only one, isn't there? i don't want to talk... i don't want to talk about it. everybody's always asking me about it. i thought you'd be different from the rest. it seems a shame to keep such a beautiful work of art hidden away... where no one can appreciate it. it's my vase and i will do what i like with it. everybody's always telling me what i have to do. martha, what's the matter? can i help you? i think, if you don't mind, lyle, i'd like to be alone for a while, please... and just rest quietly. oh, no. no, i wouldn't think of leaving you now. you need someone to take care of you. good morning, martha. how are we feeling today? oh, i'm sure, i'm much better. good. i thought maybe i could go out for a little while into the air. i haven't been out of the house for three weeks. why don't you go upstairs and try and do a little work? you know how you've missed your sculpting. do you think i could? why, of course. why, you were showing just wonderful work before this little setback of yours. why, that last head you did showed tremendous improvement. here we go, up we go. that's right. hold tight. there, now. we'll have a beautiful one-woman show for you in no time at all. sit right down, that's right. there we go. there we are. now. i've got to talk to you, mr. endicott. later, ruby. but- later. lyle. what? i don't like that maid. when are you going to get rid of her? as soon as i can find someone who'll come all the way out here. but bella will be back soon from her vacation. vacation? martha, don't tell me you've forgotten already that bella wrote you. bella wrote me? yes. when? really, lyle? martha, she wrote you in august... saying that it was too much work and that she couldn't come back. don't you remember, martha? i know i get confused sometimes... but this is different. i know. that's why i've been so very worried about you. you've been wonderful, lyle. i don't know why you put up with a silly old woman. but i do worry. it's wrong. why is it wrong? she's got that vase hidden away somewhere. what good's it doing her? i know, lyle, but she's a helpless old woman. i do wish you'd give up the idea. maybe koether might know where it is. i'm sure he doesn't. are you positive? yes. she's got it hidden away in that house somewhere. i may have to strangle her, but i'll get it. darling. who's max reisenweber? he's one of the most important art collectors in europe. he's written the museum a couple of times. koether seems to think he's a bit shady. oh? why do you ask? ""and if it is a genuine cheney vase... ""i may be induced to go as high as $45,000... ""payable in dollars, or marks at frankfurt."" think of what we could do with all that money. we'd go to europe, we can have cars, clothes... where's the book with the picture of the vase in it? yeah. ""the cheney vase is comparatively small... being eight inches high. ""made of porous sodaphine... ""it bears a simple crimson design on a lustrous natural background. ""it was discovered by the archeologist, william cheney, in 1881."" what now? i think you might start learning german and arrange about your passport. i think we ought to deliver it to that very nice mr. reisenweber in person. who's that? i figured you'd been up here for such a time, maybe a cup of tea would taste good. nobody told me, i just figured. now, that's very... that's very kind. put it on the table. i don't remember your name, my dear. ruby boyenton. ruby... where is mr. endicott? i don't know. downstairs, i guess. ruby. i want you to help me. i've got to get out of here, and he won't let me. he won't let me see anyone. he's done something to the telephone and i can't call anyone. you've got to help me. now, this is to my attorney. i want you to take it and make sure that he gets it. will you, please? please. thank you. allow me, dear. why didn't you ring? i don't think i can get what i want in this house anymore. martha. you know that everything i do here is for you. why, i feel like almost one of the family. lyle, this arrangement of ours, it hasn't worked out. i want you to go. martha, i'd feel guilty if i left you now. you know you're not yourself. you are not responsible. i know i haven't been myself recently. but i'm beginning to see everything very clearly now. how can you say that, martha? when you have such delusions. when you can write such fantastic letters like this? martha, really. hello. hello, darling. listen, i'm afraid i got some bad news. i think our little scheme's down the drain. the man from her bank is just here, and it seems like the cheney vase... is in the safe deposit box down there. good evening, darling. how about a drink? i've had a bad day. why can't just once, just once, something work out right for us? and now she says she needs a rest... and she wants to go off somewhere with me for a month. where are you going? her sister's got a place up in maine. i don't know. we'll be stuck up in the north woods... with no telephone, i won't- stop it, lyle! i'm sick of death of your lying... i'm sick of whatever you're doing to that poor woman. what are you talking about? when you applied for your passport, you gave the museum as your business address. i did a little checking, and suddenly everything began to fall into place. the way you've been avoiding me... that cock-and-bull story about the vase being in a bank somewhere. and now you're going off to maine. all right, i'll level with you. you're right. i do consider you and your morality excess baggage... but since i'm off to frankfurt tonight at 8:30... what? oh, yes. it's been delightful, pamela, every minute of it. i just have time to go over and pick up the little vase from miss cheney's and be off. and i wouldn't go to the police, if i were you. that letter of recommendation you wrote implicates you just as much as me. hello. yes, mr. koether. i'm at the station. i hate to bother you, but i have a mountain of work. i wondered if you could come round the museum tomorrow... even though it's saturday. yes. yes, i think so. fine. i'll tell you about the trip tomorrow. mr. koether, go to mrs. cheney's at once, it's important. he'll be there by 6:00. you haven't got time. it's almost 5:00 now. it'll take him an hour to get there from the station. i still have time. i wouldn't do that, mr. endicott. that one might be the original. and i wouldn't try to make me tell you which one it is. i'm a poor, deluded old woman, probably mad, you know... i wouldn't be able to tell one from the other. you know, they're really rather good, those copies. i'll probably be able to sell them... for a great deal of money. and so another american primitive was born. thinking our audience... might be interested in obtaining a memento of tonight's story... we asked grandma cheney... to whip up a few thousand more vases. and we're prepared to make an amazing offer... on a strictly first-come first-served basis. listen closely, this will not be repeated. if you wish one of these lovely vases... just send us your name and address... together with $45,000 in cash. piease do not send stamps or coins. my, they did go fast, didn't they? next week we shall return- please, don't be alarmed. plastic. next week we shall return with another story. good night."

we'll ride her through, bones. what else can we do? - ride her through where? - through the center of things, doctor. through what may be the center of everything. where are we? i'm afraid our navigational coordinates mean very little here, lieutenant. my readings indicate we are not in time and space as we understand it. doctor, these readings may interest you. captain, the subspace radio, it's dead. even the ship's chronometers have stopped. captain, there's no reason for it, but the engines are fading out. apparently, the natural laws of our universe don't operate here, captain. ship's life support systems fading. jim, we need oxygen. - helmsman, emergency battery power. - there is none, captain. all systems are dead. jim, we've got to do something. humans. lovely primitive humans. can't you do anything right? please. of course, friend. of course. rhadamanthus! everything is working, my friends. it cannot. it is not logical. logic? whose logic, my elfin friend? look around you, spock. everything is working. welcome! i knew eventually humans would come searching for me. - who are you? - call me lucien! call me friend! never could i abandon those who come to rollick with me. but not up here. no, no. let us leave this vessel and go where true delights lie! bones, you all right? nothing wrong, jim, but a face full of dust. but if i had a medical tricorder... jim, look at yourself. - lucien, do something. - very well, captain. i'd forgotten how much bodily integrity means to you humans. this isn't easy, you know, holding us together like this. it's not even natural. being in one piece is very natural where we come from. i find this all quite absorbing, doctor. probably because you're not very natural to begin with, spock. look, lucien, or whatever you want to call yourself, i want to know why you brought us here. children will play. is this better, my friends? i've translated my world into symbols your minds can understand. welcome, my friends, to megas-tu. and just exactly what is megas-tu? a world, captain james kirk, that operates by rules quite different from those in your universe. our universe operates by what you superstitiously call magic. i know this is just my imagination but... it is real, doctor. beautiful? no. but all our women are as young and beautiful as they want to be. so as to ensnare the man of her dreams, she needs an edge. - a love philter? - never settle for anything less. do you need a room, a stable, a castle? stop in at your friendly sorcerer-contractor. - let him do the work. - of course. our federation scientists were more correct than they realized. in order to function, the galactic creation point must extend through space, time, into another dimension where the logic of things is totally different. it took magic to get your vessel working again. magic you, my friends, don't know how to work. but then you never did know, did you? lucien, you keep calling us friends, implying that you know us. how? oh, captain, captain, to feign such ignorance to me. very well. look. megas-tu may seem to you a chaotic world, but its people are calm, peaceful, contemplative, each a specialist in his own kind of magic. there are no rivals anywhere in our universe, captain kirk. no other life forms at all. millennia ago, in our search for companionship, we megans passed through the point between dimensions, and eventually, we found ourselves on your world, earth. wherever we went, we became advisors to mankind. to help your ancestors, we drew on the power left behind in our own universe and made it work in your world. but eventually, we had to leave. i didn't want to, my friends. how i fought! i was the generalist amid all the specialists. the troublemaker, they said. but i'd always loved the people of earth. those were the days. but now you've come to me, and i'm so very glad. but why did you megans leave earth? if you enjoyed it so much, i don't understand. captain, good captain, always so curious. that must be why i've always liked you earthlings so much. no. you must go. what is it? what's wrong? you must return to your vessel. quickly! do not give your presence away. - captain. - captain kirk, what... - everyone onboard is all right? - fine, captain. but you? mr. scott, i'm bewildered, that's all. but that's enough. what did he mean, we're not to give ourselves away? - can't they detect the ship up here? - no, unless they have scanners. see. there. it's like a cloud of some kind. it's been between us and the planet since you vanished. if lucien put it there... if lucien put it there, captain, the questions become, ""why is he hiding us?"" and, ""what is our danger if discovered by the rest of his people?"" weapons status, mr. scott? we may have to protect ourselves. no way, captain. everything's out but life support systems. and i can't figure out how they're on. i believe this is how the ancients used to draw their mystic symbols, captain. spock, do you honestly believe that as long as we're in this universe, we can work magic, too? one uses the resources at hand, captain. watch now. i will attempt to move a vulcan chess piece magically. may the energy of this universe be the power in me. - forget it, spock. it won't work. - it must work, doctor. it is logical here. power of this universe, enter my being. i know i can. i believe i can. captain's log, supplemental. in this incredible universe, it appears to be a part of the natural laws that belief is as potent a force as energy and matter are in our own. good luck. what are you doing? learning to protect ourselves, lucien. protect yourselves? is that all human beings ever think about? i'll take care of you. that's what friends are for. all this mental energy you're using, it can be traced. you'll be found. have been found! so, the people of earth would spread their evil to our home? we are ready for human perfidy this time. this time, it is the humans who shall suffer, the humans, and you, lucien, who shall pay! keep calm. it looks like ancient earth, spock. 16th or 17th century, i'd guess. approximately 1691, captain. salem, massachusetts, if i recall your historical records correctly. we are gathered here today, good citizens, to see justice done. you are the judges. these are the defendants, as representatives of the vilest species in all the universe, treacherous humanity, and those who would aid them. as a specialist in the ethics of magic, i have been appointed prosecutor here. wait. if this is a trial, we have the right to know what you think we've done. has this one not told you how we visited your earth? or what was done to us there? lucien has said only that you came as wise men, helpful wizards. then hear this. know that once, upon your world, i was known as asmodeus, he who sees all. gaze upon my countenance, so that you too may see. we came to your world as friends. but wherever we went, the story was invariably the same. some humans would attempt to use us to gain power, to serve their own greed and lust. when we refused to serve them, they turned against us and taught other humans to fear us, to hate. they called us devils, warlocks, evil sorcerers. those of us who survived came to the town of salem in massachusetts, as settlers, and tried to live like other men. but you made mistakes, used your powers... - and burned for it. burned! - as witches. we massed together, outside the town, immersed ourselves in megan lore, revived ourselves enough to unite our minds and reach into our own universe, tap enough of its power to return from your hellish earth to megas-tu. and loneliness and fear... should we not fear the earthlings? should we not fear the cruelty of outsiders? never again have we explored. never again has companionship been sought. yet here you are. and if one earth ship can find us, friend kirk, then so can others. that's what they fear. we do not want to hurt you. we have never had to hurt anyone before. if there were some reason not to... who will speak in defense of the earth humans? i will, asmodeus. - i am not of earth. - yes, you are different. the court will hear a defense. i call lucien as my first witness. lucien, you alone of all those here do not seem to fear or hate humans. - why? - they are like me, - why? - they are like me, with questions to be answered, with minds that range outward, boundless. but every megan is always alone in his sphere of knowledge. humans are always together. they share. that is why i adopted your ship when i saw it arrive. thank you, lucien. next witness, please. captain james t. kirk. tell the court, please, captain kirk. would you say that since salem, humans have changed? i think we've been trying to, spock. humans have their faults, greed, envy, panicky fear. but in the centuries since the salem witch trials, we have learned. we try to understand and respect all life forms. indeed, captain. could you elaborate? the records of the enterprise are open for your inspection. all the history of earth and the federation is at your disposal. look at general order #1, ""no starship may interfere with the normal development ""of any alien life or society."" compare that with the earth you once knew. enough! here is your history. here are your records. citizens, you have heard, you have read. how do you vote? according to your records, your entry here was an accident unlikely to be duplicated. with that in mind, plus all you have said, it seems to us that megas-tu is safe. but lucien must be punished. for his betrayal of his people, he shall be confined in limbo for all eternity, to live with only himself. no. to isolate someone like lucien, that's the same as sentencing him to death. do you realize who you defend? he has told you his name is lucien. would you defend him still if you knew he had another name, too? the rollicker. the tempter. lucifer. we're not interested in legend. he's a living being, an intelligent life form. that's all we have to know about him. we will not join in harming him. submit, captain. you haven't the power to fight us. captain, use the magic you know. believe. you cannot beat an entire planet, captain kirk. there is no way you can win. i have to. or you'll become as bad as the earthmen you fear. you're acting out of terror, instead of out of thought or respect. you were prepared to die for lucien, a being who is alien to you? as i was sure you would, friend kirk. i told them their fears were groundless. i don't understand. this last was a test of your intentions, captain. we had to be certain your records were no ruse. we have been tricked before much to our pain and sorrow. i see. the megans had to have proof that mankind had grown and learned wisdom since they last saw earth. your compassion was that proof, captain. if your people should visit us now, we shall do our best to welcome them. the banishment of fear will help us all. a favorite old earth custom of mine, asmodeus. a toast to a new friendship. all systems go, captain. we're back to normal. no more magic for us, jim. it's all back there. you think lucien really was the demon some men call lucifer? - does it really matter, bones? - it just might, captain. if he was, this would be the second time lucifer was cast out, and, thanks to you, the first time he was saved."

ah, yes. yes. well, it happens to the best of us. mind you, i can't complain. married to my business in a way. the old boy left her everything. chance of a lifetime for yours truly. i'm not saying we don't have our problems-- shirkers, unions, council cutbacks. but the money's there. no two ways about it. you just got to go out and hustle for it these days. ah. about time, too. coffee? what? - coffee. - ah, yes. yes, please. two coffees. and i'll have another one of these. pass the celery, will you? what was i saying? ah. i was talking about myself too much. i always do when i eat. i can't tell you how good it is to see you again. what are you doing with yourself, my old stinker? well, i-- well, i'm a contract estimator for a firm of paint manufacturers. mm. fix prices? make sure no one is cheating? that sort of thing, yes. everybody cheats nowadays. that's rather a sweeping generalization, isn't it? i'm damn sure some of my boys are robbing me. oh, quite possibly. recognize any way of stopping that kind of thing? well, if the estimates are properly checked, certainly. how much do they pay you at your paint shop? 4,550 pounds a year. skinflints, aren't they? come and work for me, and i'll double it. you think it's the drink talking, don't you? ah. thank you, steward. never affects me in the way of business. what do you say? oh, absolutely not. why? i don't like cutler. at school he used to call me the stinker. what? tinker the stinker. - a little joke on your name? - it wasn't a joke! it caught on. people used to hold their noses if i got near them. or pretend not to see me, and walk about saying, pooh, what's that stink? honestly! made my life a misery. well now he's giving you a chance to change it. and not just your life, our lives. you don't know cutler! but i know the rut we're in though, don't i? it's been 10 years, harold! the same house, same firm, same job. it's a chance. a chance, at last, to change, move, do things. and you because of some stupid joke someone played on you. - it wasn't a joke! - what? 30 years ago or more. you expect me to stand quietly by, and watch you chuck it away. - it wasn't a joke. don't you understand? that was what was so diabolical about it. he put the finishing touches to the feeling of inadequacy that my father drilled into me. he thought i was wet. to be told every day by my peers that i was also offensive. jack cutler meant destroy me. and he very nearly succeeded. well, i think you're making a bit much of it. it sounds like a typical bit of adolescent boys' beastliness to me. and anyway, it's history! i'm trying to explain-- i know your father was a monster. i met him. and i've had to live with your woeful insecurity. this is being childish. i'm your wife. and you say you love me. well, you know i do. then take the job. at least see if your old school pal means it. please? for my sake. i want a bit of life before i die. well, we'll see. well, we all know what that means, don't we? oh, don't go off like that! my revolver was empty, and i was surrounded. and what to do? surrender? i don't mind telling you, harold, my boy. i thought about it. well, i wouldn't have been human if i hadn't [inaudible].. i thought about it, and i rejected it. unworthy. yeah. put my head down, and i charged them. laid about me. startled the life. out of them, and got clean through and away. well, i couldn't go blubbing home, could i? david couldn't go blubbing home, could he? he stood there and he slew goliath. and that's what you're going to do! you're going to go back there, and you're going to stand up for yourself, or by god you'll have to reckon with me, boy! i decided. i'm going to take that job. oh, darling! if he means it. it'll make all the difference. let's hope so. oh, i feel quite differently about you already. hmm? oh quite, quite differently! what's all this then? i thought i made it quite clear. good lord, i haven't got time for all that rubbish. i've got to get in a game of golf this afternoon. we've only this moment just got back from lunch. all work and no play makes jack a dull boy. isn't that what they say? they also say that when the cat's away, the mice will play. i see. all right. give it to me in a nutshell. well, um, one of the foremen has been-- he's been working with one of the sales managers to inflate the cost of jobs. - and pocketing the difference. - no. well, i can't prove that. don't give me all that claptrap. well, i can only tell you what the figures show. that's the beauty of them. they're absolutes. like music. you can-- you can fit theories round them. i mean, there they just are. never mind the poetry. i'm paying you to find out if i'm being swindled. oh, unquestionably. they're putting in false invoices. how do you know they're false? well, the firms don't exist. you can't get much falser than that, can you? how much have they been getting away with? well, in the current financial year, it amounts to about 10,000 pounds. does it, by god? names? the foreman is gould. len gould? well, that's nice. that's really nice. i should have pensioned him off years ago, and he begged me to keep him on. said he'd get bored. and all the time he's-- which sales manager? alan shaw. you sure about that? positive. thank god you changed your mind about coming to work for me. you've earned your keep already. yes, but what will you do? sack the pair of them so fast they'll never won't what hit them. well done my old stinker! [classical music] do you like it? won't be long now. what is it anyway? order books. just making sure they tally with the delivery dockets. oh, yes? what do you think of them? oh, very nice. you mean you hadn't noticed? not until you mentioned them. oh, you're hopeless. still, it's good to see you interested in your work. well, it is interesting. and i've got plenty of scope. and i'm more or less my own boss. see? matter of fact, i uncovered a fraud the other day. i hope mr. cutler was properly impressed. think he was rather. if you ask me, i think he's trying to make amends for being so beastly to you at school. still calls me stinker. who cares? i do. supper's ready when you are. i still don't like him. my wife phyllis, mr. cutler. oh, jack. jack. jack. for heaven's sake! most of my friends call me phyl. i say! all the comforts of home. what'll it be? a gin and tonic would be lovely. gin, gin, makes you sin. you better have one, too, old boy. i won't have you left out in the cold! i must say, i love that dress. oh! it's just the first thing i laid my hands on. i don't think i've seen it before. given the game away there, haven't you? he did, a bit. to tell you the truth, it is new. oh, my! and it's lovely. leaves a little bit to the imagination, but not too much. yes. cheers and cheers! i was looking forward to meeting you, i must say. but i'd no idea i'd got such a treat in store. you're a dark horse, aren't you, my old stinker? oh, harold said that's what you called him. just a hangout from the school days. best years of our lives. isn't that what they say? thank god it isn't true. all: stinker! stinker! stinker! stinker! stinker! stinker! stinker! stinker! stinker! stinker! i want you to run mr. and mrs. stinker home, meech. - very good, sir. - oh! we could get a taxi. couldn't we, harold? well of, course. what on earth, for? well, i mean if it's any trouble. well, it's what he's here for! isn't it, meech? yes indeed, sir. unless of course, my poor old car isn't good enough for you. well, i'm sure my wife didn't mean-- ah! just pulling your leg! he was only teasing, harold. you are awful! i'm not half i'm not half what i would be if it weren't for the beady eye of your spouse!

[music continues] (whistling) look, uh-- would you mind if i gave you my share of the rent next week? this bird's costing me the earth. well, um-- what about the 200 pound? charlie prince: what? i mean, um-- uh, what about the 200 pound i lent you? can't we leave that till next month? someone owes me, too. look, uh-- here's, um, 20 for expenses. [music continues] [music playing] who is this girl of yours? i'm not telling you. you'd only laugh. listen, you're ashamed of her. no, the opposite. oh! you want to impress her. yes. could you-- - on a small budget. - yes. mm. well, to start with-- hang on. i'll, um-- um-- wine. anything decent is ruinous. you say, they've a rather good house wine here, flinty, sort of burgundy. care to try it? you can always send it back and save you a fiver. taxis! man who gets a taxi always gets the girl. you go into the ritz by the piccadilly entrance. go through the hotel and out the other entrance where there's a commission there. he gets the taxi, and the girl is staggered by your insolence. do i, um-- do i tip the commissionaire? give the bastard 10 p. girl won't know it isn't 50. i could suggest some changes in your vocabulary. don't say toilet, say loo. don't say serviette, say napkin. god's sake, don't say pardon. say what. [music playing] fine. well, if it breaks below 70, we could have chapter setting. but it's holding. - i'll take one. we'll buy-- [interposing voices] you're very smart these days, arthur. uh, thank you, sir. it's thanks to my aunt mary, sir. i was her sole heir. she was, uh, rather well-advised on her investments. i'm glad for you. thank you. [music playing] look, i must have something! [music continues] take her slumming! they love it. [music continues] [no speech] and in any case, you know perfectly well that only senior partners are authorized to deal. [dialing on telephone] i heard about this revolution on the early morning news. i dashed into the office at 8:00. there was absolutely no one here i could consult, except the cleaners. and so i sent the telex on my own authority. you've landed us up to the neck in a deal that-- [buzzing] john, can you spare a-- n-- no. well, it looks as if your authorized telex has probably made us a great deal of money. well done, arthur. uh, thank you, sir. [music playing] good evening. [music continues] i'm just, uh, off to the bahamas. my buds, friends got a place there. she's paying my fare. i'm sorry, but you will have to manage without my wardrobe. i need it. well, hard luck. you can, uh, have that suit and the shirts still at the laundry. you owe me five weeks' rent and the loan, 300 sodding pounds. i'll send you a check. you've got no bank account. you told me. i need the clothes, and i need the money! that's your problem. for me, it's, uh-- palm trees, white beaches, and the tinkle of ice in rum cocktails. [suspenseful music] what are you doing, arthur? um-- mr. prince has gone abroad, and his damn trunk takes up far too much room. you might have hurt yourself or scratched the paint. uh, no. there's no damage done. and, eleanor, i'm wondering if i could put it in your cellar, just for the time being. he wants it sent on, you see. well, i-- i hardly ever go down there. not out of this room. um, the lock's awkward. i'll-- uh, i'll let you in. [suspenseful music] [music crescendos] there's his uniform trunk. that's his tin hat, as we used to call them. the dent-- - really? --is german shrapnel. and he was killed by one of our own bombs. i hardly ever come down here. too many memories. [ominous music] [sentimental music] morning! mr. charlie prince? that's me. [ominous music] thank you, sir. thank you. you're an angel. and he does deserve it. a register office wedding, i suppose? yes. neither of us go to church. oh, good. that's easily arranged. that's not quite how i saw it at all, sir. i saw ann, radiant in clouds of white, bridesmaids, the choir, the crowded church. in fact, i saw her with the best of everything. you do want the best for your daughter, sir. of course. of course, that is a way of putting it. um-- it would be an opportunity to get together and celebrate as a family. daddy, let's ask all the family. [suspenseful music] [doorbell ringing] [music continues] it's all right, miss tanner. i'll go. oh, good evening. we've called to see mr. prince. charles prince. oh, i-- i understand he's gone abroad. oh. did he leave a forwarding address? not with me. won't you come in a moment? mr. horton: thank you. [music continues] mrs. marsh: arthur! it's a gentleman to see mr. prince. arthur is a friend of mr. prince. i'm sure he'll be able to help you. such a nice man. they share the first floor flat. well, that is until mr. prince went abroad. he did leave a trunk. it's in the cellar. arthur! you live here, too! we've come to see charlie. he's my brother! we used to call him prince charlie, bonny prince charlie. mr. horton: strange. no forwarding address. i'd like to see that trunk. [theme music]"
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[theme music] i think one has more fun being a wine lover in england than in any other country. and that's because london's where nearly all the great wine auctions take place. there's one almost every week of the year. and for decades i've haunted these auctions and the tastings that go before them. as a result, the old cellar below our house contains at this moment over 5,000 bottles of wine. some of it is superb. most of it's pretty good. we drink a bottle or two every night and it doesn't seem to do us much damage. here's a wine story i wrote when i first became fascinated by the subject. because the first thing one must do is smell. tv presenter: smell? [laughs] i mean, of course, smell in the active sense, [sniff] to smell. only after one has smelt, so to speak, does one taste. tv presenter: all right, then, let's put you to the test again. and let me assure everyone at home that richard pratt has no idea what wines we've chosen for him. all right, then. richard pratt, where does this wine come from? [spit] oh. [laughing] this is a very good-humored fellow. mm-mm. mm. [spit] a benevolent, cheerful little chap. oh, dear. it's like a [inaudible],, perhaps. a little bit naughty. pompous idiot. [inaudible] less good-humored. let's see. german, of course. um, not far from bad kreuznach. that would account for the naughtiness. 1959, i think. yes, nice [german] 1959. how's that? absolutely right. four out of four. yes. sybil: don't switch it off. so we'll-- sybil: just turn down the sound. of course, the word [inaudible].. sybil: i want to know when he finishes because he said he's coming straight on after the program. i don't know why we go to so much trouble when we're going to be bored by all that wine talk. sybil: your father likes him. i can't bear the way he stares at me. looks at me as though i were one of his favorite clarets. sybil: he's meant to be very good on clarets. who else did you say was coming? the blighs, pete and joanna. they're americans. you'll love them. he's a writer. oh, what's he write? i have no idea. but he must do very well. he's got your father as a stockbroker, and she always looks tanned. would you taste this, please, mrs. schofield? what is it, mrs. adams? it's the horseradish that i'm making, but i'm afraid it may be a little too strong. you taste it, dear. it is a little too strong. and don't forget, mrs. adams, dear. the beef's to go on the minute he arrives. mr. pratt likes it very rare. mrs. adams: he'll get it rare, all right. louise, ask your father about the wines. i want to know what glasses to put out. where is he? in his study. green filing cabinet. - dad. - please, no draft. sorry. mummy wants to know what glasses to put out. hawke claret champagne. right. and go quietly. [sniff] yes. yes. yes, yes, yes. sybil: oh, dear. louise: what? sybil: it's over. [theme music on tv] crew: live studio, that is a wrap. tv presenter: and thank you very much, mr. pratt. an amazing display. really first class. not at all. you must excuse me in my rush, surely. don't go without these, then. oh, thank you, thank you. i'm always doing that. can't read a thing without them. oh. a very naught fellow indeed. [chuckle] this way. joanna: peter, i must say, he does sound absolutely fascinating. mike: oh, he is, he is. absolutely fascinating. he has the most amazing sense of taste of any man i've ever met. do you do you always have a bet each time he comes to dinner? i'm afraid so. it's getting rather expensive. oh. why? what are the stakes? well, let me explain. we only bet on the claret. oh, mike, isn't that what we call cabernet? well done, joanna. absolutely right. cabernet is the name of the vine. cabernet sauvignon. joanna: sauvignon? mike: the vine of the great clarets of bordeaux. honey, you never fail to surprise me. go on, mike. as i'm saying, we only bet on the claret. i serve a wine, then challenge him to name the breed and the vintage, and he gives me a case of the wine in question if he can't. - a case! ooh. but he always can. yes. that's true. i've never beaten him. [laughter] but tonight i really believe i have a wine that will absolutely baffle him. well, i'll drink to that. he doesn't sound like the kinda guy who's easily baffled, either. he's not. and it's not only wines he knows about. he's a gourmet, too. oh, yeah, i read about that somewhere. he's the president of a society called the epicures or something. they get together once a month and stuff themselves on sumptuous dishes and rare wines. yes. i'm a member. [doorbell] that will be him. louise, would you? mike: i'm afraid i must ask you not to smoke. pratt's most fastidious about that sort of thing. you don't want his taste buds damaged. no, i certainly don't. [slam] good evening. ah. louise. aren't you coming in? i'll lead the way. - uh, one moment. this couldn't be more opportune. i did so want a word with you in private. i have a little gift for you. a gift? ok. do open it. i want to know if you like it. it's my latest and i've inscribed it to you. do look. i mean it. ""to louise from her admirer."" heartfelt words. thank you. i think we'd better go in. they'll be wondering what's happened to us. [chatter, laughter] sybil, dear, lovely as ever. hello, mike. let me introduce the blighs. joanna and peter, richard pratt. forgive me for being late. i've come straight from the television studio. how do you do? sybil: we saw you. very impressed. not at all. they gave me some extremely well-known wines to taste. these television people are all idiots, you know. i only do it because they do so insist on one appearing. to think i couldn't name a charbonnier. [laughs] [laughs] i trust, mike, you will have something a little more challenging for me this evening. tonight, richard, i'm going to win. joanna: ooh, good for you. you bet, mr. pratt. and you, sir, what do you do? i write. richard pratt: how interesting. under your own name? yes. i myself have just published a new book. as a matter of fact, i presented a copy to louise. sybil: how charming of you, richard. what's it called? ""great post war vintages."" i say. riveting. riveting. i hope you all buy it. [chime] joanna: oh! well, mike. are you ready for me? i am. joanna: oh, you mean we do the wine-- shh. joanna: --uh, before the dinner? [laughs] how do you wine-taste with soda? [laughs] [chuckle] oh, perhaps i ought to explain. you see, richard never has an aperitif. good heavens, no. but what i always do is retire briefly before dinner is served and gargle with soda water. [laughs] you don't really gargle with soda-- soda water sponges out the palate, scours out all the unwanted tastes. and that way, i am ready to face the challenge of my host. excuse me. isn't he extraordinary? here. oh, yeah, he's extraordinary. great thing about moselle, it's the perfect wine to serve before a claret. a lot of people said a rhine wine, but that's because they don't know any better. it's barbaric to serve a rhine wine before a claret. but a moselle, ah, a moselle is exactly right. mm. --quite the most famous of [inaudible].. he said, uh-- mike: charming little wine. steak au poivre-- mike: don't you think so, richard? --is like eating chicken with bananas, to which the american who was from the state of maryland said, but i don't like chicken with bananas. [goofy laugh] oh, dear, have i kept you all waiting? i am sorry. louise is such an interesting companion. mm. [loud clinking] oh, delicious. i congratulate you, sybil. absolutely perfect. fried in butter, very crisp, a dash of lemon. mm. really excellent. mm. so, ah, mosel. [inaudible] 1971, i believe. exactly right. so much better to serve a mosel rather than a rhine before the claret. precisely what i said. that's what he said. now, this is a very courteous personage. slightly feminine, rich, rather like your daughters of the american revolution-- not quite as well off as they used to be. beautifully mannered lady. now for the claret. thank you, mrs. adams, dear. i must go and fetch the claret. go and fetch it? where is it? in my study with the cork out, breathing. but why is it in your study? mike: being chambred, of course. pardon? mike: acquiring room temperature. yes, but why in your study? well, since richard and i began these little contests, we've had to see the conditions as near perfect as possible. so together we explored the house to find the best spot for the wind to breathe. and we hit upon the top of the green filing cabinet in my study. draft-free, even temperature. do excuse me. joanna: [laughing] on top of the green filing cabinet? there's nowhere else in the whole house where you can-- no, that is the perfect place. oh, you do take these contests seriously. indeed i do. and tonight i'm taking it especially seriously. why? i may want to raise the stakes. sybil: to what? [chatter] peter: this is what you eat every night? you'll never name this one, richard. you'll never get it, not in a hundred years. it's a claret, of course. i assume, then, it's one of the smaller vineyards. maybe it is, and then again, maybe it isn't. but it's a good year? one of the great years? yes, that i can guarantee. then that shouldn't be too difficult. and look, richard i won't force you to bet on this one. and why not? because it's a very difficult wine. but i was just saying to the others while you were out of the room that tonight i felt like increasing the bet. no that would be silly. but if you want to bet, we'll have the usual-- a case of the wine itself. you don't think i can name it, do you? as a matter of fact, and with all due respect, i don't. [giggling] oh, i like this. i like this more and more. now, come on, michael, let's increase the bet. no, a case is plenty. would you like to bet 50 cases? [laughter] 50? oh, dear, good, ridiculous richard. do start, everyone. it'll get cold. thank you. looks absolutely perfect. so you don't want to increase the bet? as far as i'm concerned, old man, i don't give a damn. i'll bet you anything you like. anything i like? shall we say 10,000 pounds? [laughter] that better not be my 20,000 bucks you're laying out. well, certainly, if that's what you want. so you would bet anything i like? - well, that's what i said. - mike. mike, stop this nonsense and allow us to eat our food. [polite laughter] sybil, i'm sorry you should think this is nonsense. we're just making a little bet. oh, i do love a good bet. now, let's see. what shall we bet for tonight? you'll never guess this one, richard, so i don't give a damn what the stakes are, you're on. i want you to bet the hand of your daughter in marriage. [coughing, laughing] hey, that's not funny. ok, daddy, that's not funny at all. no, you dear, they're only joking. i'm not joking. that's ridiculous. but you said i could bet anything i liked. - i meant money. - you didn't say money. well, that's what i meant. it's a pity you didn't say it, but of course if you want to go back on your word. it's not a question of going back to my word, old man. it's a no bet and i'll tell you why. you can't match the stake. you don't have a daughter of your own to put up against mine if you lose. and even if you had, i wouldn't want to marry her. [laughter] i'm pleased to hear that, dear. yes, i thought you might be. very well, then. i'll bet you anything you like. my house, for example. how about my house? which one? the country one. well, why not the town one as well? why not? very well, if you wish, both my houses. now, daddy, don't be absurd. it's too silly for words. i refuse to be betted on like this. quite right, dear. stop it at once, mike. do eat your food. you know, louise, we ought to think about this. stop it, daddy. i'm not listening. louise, just-- i've never heard of anything so ridiculous in all my life. just wait a moment and hear what i have to say. i don't want to hear you. he's he's willing to bet two houses. and the point is this-- he can't possibly win. he seems to think he can. now, listen to me, because i'm never done talking about it. the expert, when tasting a claret-- it's not as if it is not one of the famous great wines like la fille de latour-- could only get a certain way towards naming the vineyard. he can, of course, tell you which bordeaux district the wine comes from, whether it's from saint-emilion, pomerol, graves, or medoc. but then, each district has several communes-- little counties. and each county has many, many small vineyards. it's impossible for a man to differentiate between them just by taste and smell alone. i don't mind telling you that the one i have here is a wine from a small vineyard surrounded by many other small vineyards and he'll never get it. it's impossible. - are you sure? of course i'm sure. just think about it. you'll be rich. two houses. you can sell them. you'll be independent for the rest of your life. mike, stop it. now. sybil, don't interfere. i'm the girl's father. louise, i wouldn't let you in for something you didn't want. take the bet. i guarantee you can't lose. i don't like it. you're being silly. [indiscriminate whispering] come on, joanna, what do you say? peter? should she or shouldn't she? uh, could you just leave us out of this, please? i'll drink to that. come on, girl. take it. i'm making you a fortune. we can't lose. daddy, supposing he do lose? i'm your father, girl. i keep telling you you can't lose. i guarantee it. all right, then. as long as you're sure. that's my girl. good. fine. it's a bet. good. fine. it's a bet. [suspenseful music] [clink] [sniff] [clears throat] yes. very interesting little wine. gentle and gracious. almost feminine in the aftertaste. now we can begin to eliminate. i must move cautiously. there is much at stake. first then, from which district in bordeaux does this wine come? that's not too difficult. it's far too light to be either saint-emilion or graves. it's obviously a medoc. there's no doubt about that. now, from which commune in medoc does it come? it's a very gentle wine, demure and bashful and the first taste, emerging shyly but quite graciously in the second. a little arch, perhaps, something of a tease, taunting me with just a trace of tannin. then in the aftertaste, ensouling and feminine, a certain generosity that one associates only with the wines of the commune of saint-julien. unmistakeably, this is saint-julien. (yelling) i'm sorry, my dear, but i simply cannot have smoking at the table. now, let me see. where were we? this wine is from bordeaux, from the commune of saint-julien, from the district of medoc. so far, so good. now we come to the more difficult part-- the name of the vineyard itself. i'm going to try to establish the growth. if i can do that, it will be half the battle. now, let me see. well, this wine is obviously not from a first-growth vineyard, or even a second. it is not a great wine. the quality, the radiance, the, oh, je ne sais quoi, the power is lacking. but the third growth, perhaps. i must be careful. i must be very careful here. [footsteps] yes, [clears throat] i'm right. i'm sure of it. it's a fourth growth. now, good, that's better. now we're closing in. what are the fourth-growth vineyards in the commune of saint-julien? [sniff] [lapping] mm. there it is again. tannin in the middle of taste, a quick astringent squeeze on the tongue. yes, now i have it. this wine comes from one of the small vineyards around beychevelle. i remember it. i know the district well. the river, the small harbor where the wine ships can't get in anymore because they're all silted up. yes, would this be a beychevelle itself? no, i don't think so. not quite. but somewhere very close. chateau talbot. (whispering) chateau talbot. now could this be a talbot? yes. i believe it could. but i'm not happy. i'm wrong. it's not a talbot. i think this is a 1966, so it couldn't be a talbot. let me think. it's not a beychevelle and it's not a talbot, but it's so close to both of them, so close to the vineyard. it must be almost in between. somewhere to the south-- east. now, which could that be? yes. i think i have it. i think i have it. yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. [clunk] yes. this is a chateau branaire-ducru. and the year is 1966. is that your final answer? oh, yes, it is. chateau branaire-ducru, 1966. it's a pretty little vineyard. lovely old chateau. i know it quite well. i can't think why i didn't recognize it at once. oh, come on, daddy, let's have a peek. i want my two houses. just a minute. wait just a minute. michael, what's the matter? keep out of this, sybil, will you please? he's guessed right, hasn't he? well, has he? now, don't worry. this is nothing to worry about. richard, i think you and i had better slip off and have a little chat. oh, but i don't want a little chat. all i want is to see the label on that bottle. now, come along, michael, what are you waiting for? [gasp] [music playing] mrs. adams: i believe these are yours, sir. are they? perhaps they are. i don't know. oh, yes, they're yours, all right, sir. you left them in mr. schofield's study, on top of the green filing cabinet, sir, when you happened to go in there by yourself before dinner. you were carrying a soda siphon, sir. i saw you. michael. keep calm. michael. michael!

well, i'd say it was subconscious information that you finally get around to recognizing with your conscious mind. good! over a long period of time, things gather. like this garage. you start working with wood, you don't notice the shavings. then one day, you look at the floor, sawdust. dust collects, and suddenly we know something. have you noticed that more people are vanishing nowadays than ever before?

""refuse..."" oh, i see. well, under the circumstances, i'm sorry, very sorry. thank you. that was green city, downstate. the police boarded a southbound train there. roger was in a roomette. he was traveling alone. how could that be? what about his telegram? that must have been sent when his kidnappers were of their guard for a moment. he denies sending any telegram or that he needs any help. he was polite, cheerful, in good spirits, the police said. said he was on a quick business trip downstate. much obliged. thank you. good night. good night? what... what did the police do? what could they do? they looked around to see if anyone had a gun on roger, and got off the train. well... as long as he's all right. but is he? well, you just said... they said. after all, they couldn't very well insist he was in danger, and drag him off the train? could they? why did he send us that telegram warning us not to accept any special delivery packages? we never get any special deliveries. just that one that came for tom. new orleans. roger was on his way to new orleans. hello, dorothy? did the police get in touch with you? well, yes, and i don't understand. roger told them to leave him alone. oh, i see. dorothy, did your or any member of your family receive any special airmail delivery packages in the last few days? well... well, yes. about three days ago. all the boys on the block are going in for it. going in for what? why do you ask? there's nothing wrong with raising mushrooms, is there? i said, there's nothing wrong with raising mushrooms, is there? marasmius oreades. fungoid growth. but how does it fit? anyone dead? no. anyone poisoned? well. you can't sleep? oh, no. too warm. cynthia, what if roger was right and a terrible thing is happening? like the earth being invaded by things from other worlds. bill. how could creatures from outer space invade us without us not noticing them? no, i don't mean meteors or flying saucers, or anything like that, but... bacteria comes from outer space, too, doesn't it? seeds, spores, pollen, viruses by the billions hitting the atmosphere every second of every hour for millions of years, pouring down on us like an invisible rain. falling on our cities, our towns, our street. our lawn! our lawn? and mrs. goodbody's. of course, people like her are always spraying poisons and kicking mushrooms off their lawns. so it would be hard for a strange new life form to survive in the city. yes. maybe they'd be better off down south, say, alabama, louisiana. back in the dark bayous, mightn't they grow to a fine size? oh. oh, really. you don't seriously believe, do you, that the great bayou or whatever the greenhouse novelty company that sent tom his package is owned and operated by six-foot-tall mushrooms from another planet? good heavens, cynthia. there is some connection between roger, mushrooms, special delivery telegrams, mrs. goodbody, the whole works! don't get angry. oh, i'm not! it's just that... think how insidious this plan could be. these creatures from another world establish a greenery then advertise in mechanical inventions, ""grow giant mushrooms for profit."" and a million boys send in their money. tonight, this very minute, in how many homes all over the usa, are billions of mushrooms being grown by innocent boys in their cellars! now i know you aren't serious. well, half serious. mushrooms, however big, can't think or feel. well, they haven't got arms or legs. how could they run a mail order business and take over the world? come on, let's go see your monsters! there! there are your terrible fiends! come on, i'll fix you a snack. get the milk, will you, darling? cynthia, did you put these mushrooms in the refrigerator? no. tom must have. close the door, will you? cynthia, there is a way for the mushrooms to grow arms and legs. what if a man wandering through the swamp picked them up and ate them? once inside, would not the mushrooms spread through his blood, and take over every cell, change that man from a man to a martian? maybe roger ate some of the mushrooms given to him by his son and was changed into something else. but in one last moment of sanity, of being himself, he sent us a telegram, warning us not to accept any mushrooms, by special delivery. now, couldn't that be it, couldn't it? i've had enough of this! i'm going to bed! tom? don't put the light on, dad. it's bad for the mushrooms. tom? why did you put the mushrooms in the refrigerator? because i wanted you and mother to eat them. you... you didn't eat any of them yourself? yes. i did. you're hungry, aren't you? you're hungry. you're hungry. i think that story has a very comforting message for mushrooms all over the world. i'm seriously thinking of starting a counter movement to persuade the mushrooms to grow people in their basements. now that we've seen our play, i think we'll send it back. until next time, good night."
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and doctor watson, wherever you are. tonight's case is... tonight's case is called, ""the perfect crime."" i'm not sure who it was who said, ""a perfect crime is exactly the same ""their being perfect depends on your tonight we plan... this is exactly why i never take if you fall asleep, you could be and now join me, if you will, while we contemplate the perfect crime. good evening, mr. courtney. i know it's late to be calling uninvited, but i just returned from abroad, and i just saw the newspapers. haven't i seen you somewhere before? i'm john gregory. oh, yes, of course. do come in. thank you. my man is off this evening, so, if you don't mind, i'll just put all right. won't you come in and sit down? thank you. i was just sitting here enjoying the solution and, of course, some brandy. thank you. you know, i've seen you on at least in the courtroom, defending... let me see, there were the state of new york versus your client richards, and then you represented braverman, and then, if i recall, flanagan, no, it was kowtowski, then flanagan. flanagan was the last one, just before i went abroad. then you weren't here when he was executed? no. i tried to be out of the state when all four of them were killed. executed, my friend, by due process of the law and the inevitable grinding of the mills now there is exhibit a for the prosecution in the matter of your last client, flanagan. do you like brahms, mr. gregory? ordinarily, but not when it turns out i see you keep souvenirs of your success as a detective. i know only three great detectives. one is now in london. the second in paris, the third, or should i say the first, is here in this room right now. no point in false modesty, now, is there? some sportsmen decorate their walls they once shot in tanganyika, or some poor unfortunate rhino caught sunbathing in the congo. these, mr. gregory, are my trophies, perfect memories of so very many believe me, they are not monuments but tombstones to the stupidity of criminals. what's the empty space for, there in the center? for the perfect crime. for 15 years i've kept this space in the hopes that i might come to grips who had plotted a perfect murder. as you can see, it's still empty. well, if it were perfect, how would you know what souvenir could you place there? the trouble's more basic than that. i simply can't find a real challenge. murder never seems to evoke the best efforts and yet, murder it must be. oh, would you care for some more brandy? yes, thank you. oh, but tell me, why must the perfect crime necessarily be a murder? well, is it not the most reprehensible? human life is what we prize most, what we do our best to protect. to take a life with a skill that eludes detection is unquestionably the ideal criminal action. now, you make it sound pleasant. well, surgeons talk of beautiful cases, well, that's precisely my attitude. now, if it's to be murder, then it must be rule out the crime passionnel. hot blood begets innumerable blunders. no, the perfect crime must be a work of art, like the ceramics i make here done for art's sake alone, not for gain. there is only one kind of murder that's the murder of elimination, the murder in which the sole object is to remove the victim from the world. for instance, take that case which i mentioned when you came in. oh, what case would that be? the harrington case. he really should have tried to get rid of the absence of a corpus delicti is curiously troublesome to the police. although, even if he had tried i should have caught up with him nonetheless. it was harrington i came to talk to you about. but he's not one of your clients. no. i was away or i might have taken but i know him quite well. and west, and mrs. west even better. lovely woman, i understand. yes. yes, she and west are separated. she's been living in europe. yeah, i know. i'd like to hear how you tracked down simplicity itself. i chose this small revolver to recall the various aspects of course, i could have selected a tire but i fear it would have been rather troublesome or i could have exhibited the thread ends now, you knew ernest west, so you know he was a millionaire, he had a lodge near smithtown on the island and he used it as a base for duck hunting. during the season, he used to go down there west kept only one servant at the lodge, a housekeeper who had grown old but the one woman absolutely devoted to him. he'd let her off the previous evening to spend the night with her daughter she came back early to prepare his breakfast and found west shot through the heart. it was as if he'd been relaxing there was no sign of a struggle. i was called in by homicide at once. west was an important man, you know, and the department wanted immediate action. inside the house i found only one item in analyzing the dust in the gunroom, i came across several tiny thread ends that had obviously come from a tweed suit. these threads could not be matched outside there was more to go on. the ground had been damp the previous night and two sets of footprints were visible, a man's and a woman's. excluding the police's, of course. a woman's? yes, the housekeeper's. i see. the prints were difficult to identify. the man had walked up and down the lane and had trampled every one of the woman's prints. well, doesn't that seem odd? not at all. you see, he couldn't decide whether to run or stay, even though he had a car waiting for him so he paced back and forth, calming his nerves and collecting his thoughts. you say he had a car waiting for him? yes, a heavy touring car. the tracks were perfectly plain. but there was one unique feature a large, hard blister on one of the treads. it made a perfectly defined indentation in the mud every time it came around. you still haven't told me how you got with all the evidence, all that remained was to relate the clues to one suspect. such times i let my mind wander. it occurred to me that i might find my answer and sure enough, i discovered that in the three weeks prior to west's death, a certain common stock had risen 57 points. two days after he was shot, it dropped back 63 points, so i searched further. i found that a man named harrington had, on the day been short 132,000 shares of that particular stock. he had been selling short all the way up, and west had been buying all that was offered. so he simply eliminated west. it was murder for millions. now the rest was routine. in a loft in the garage of harrington's country place, the police discovered three perfect tires and a fourth with a large, hard blister. the thread ends matched one of harrington's suits. and in his wall safe we found this. west had been killed by a single shot from this gun. so harrington, of course, confessed at once. and the press... the press, i fear, made far too much mr. courtney, i haven't held that gun, have i? i don't follow you. since i've been here tonight, i haven't seen the gun isn't that correct? i mean, i haven't seen the handle. no, don't, don't. keep it covered. but tell me, is the handle slightly chipped and does a crack run all the way up yes, it does, but how did you know? harrington did not kill west. you caught the wrong person. the wrong man died in the electric chair. harrington was innocent. how can you... how can you say such a thing? i not only can say it, mr. courtney, i can prove it. do you realize what you're telling me? i do. careful of it. it's still loaded. the four of us were target shooting alice dropped this on a rock. alice west? mmm. that's how it got chipped. well, what do you mean, the four of you? alice, west, harrington, and myself. we were all stopping at the same hotel in switzerland. when was this? my first trip over, four years ago. and this was alice's gun. why, then she gave it to harrington. no, i doubt it. as much as she loved him, i doubt it. he probably took it away from her, but too late. now you're talking in riddles. what do you mean? simply that this little weapon helped to execute now look here, gregory, you of all people should know how precise, how painstaking, how objective i am you can't pop in here in the middle of the night and four years ago in switzerland, harrington fell in love and she with him. west played dog in the manger, refused to give her a divorce. of course, she left him, but that didn't help her i was in on the affair from the first. i tell you, he even behaved very badly. well, under the circumstances, why shouldn't he? he hadn't loved alice for a long time. and he simply made up his mind that no other man was going then she began to drink. i'm afraid she's become a hopeless alcoholic. this last trip, i saw her in monte carlo at her hotel. we'd been talking about her husband's murder. i'd been speculating as to who could have done it. you hadn't yet arrested harrington. i asked her if she and harrington weren't going what distressed me most was her listless attitude, as though some terrible thing had possessed her mind. she went to her purse and gave me something to read. a letter. the last letter her husband had sent her. it was cruel, sadistic. it told her how he intended until she died a bitter old woman, that he would come and laugh over her there was a lot more, but it made me sick. i didn't want to finish it. she said, ""what would you do to a man like that?"" i found myself answering, ""kill him. kill him!"" and then, all at once, she screamed the words back at me until i got her to stop. then, as calmly as i could, i pointed out that someone i'll never forget the way she looked at me or the change that came over her face. ""it's funny,"" she said. ""you can shoot the heads off all the innocent bottles ""no one says a word."" ""but if you kill a human snake, "" she said, ""and i don't want to burn, thank you very much. "" do you follow me, mr. courtney? there was no reason for harrington to borrow to kill west, now was there? borrow it? he had access to it. you said so yourself. he simply took it. why? he had quite a little arsenal well, yes. we did find a couple of service revolvers exactly. he would never have used a toy to kill west, that he would or would not have used a.25 caliber is merely an assumption on your part. it's certainly non-conclusive. why, he might have used a pointed stick or a boomerang, for all anybody could have... granted. but he never would've committed murder. he's far too level-headed. three years ago, i tracked down a fine, and brought him back here to face a jury of his peers. his defense attorney made the same argument. ""my client is much too level-headed ""he's not the type. ""why, he had never made a mistake in his life, ""even in long division when he was back in school. ""he was secretary of this and chairman of that ""calm, cool and collected was this young man."" well, you can imagine what the district attorney made yes, i know. district attorneys are not noted for their understanding may i ask you a question, mr. courtney? was alice west in europe when her husband was killed? don't you suppose we checked? of course, she was. i'm afraid your check wasn't very thorough. alice west was in montreal the month her husband was killed. and montreal isn't too far from long island. impossible. she told me so herself. she registered at the ritz hotel in montreal. the french police verified the fact that she was in europe. we have the cables. oh, she was in europe, all right, before the murder but did you check her passport, her entry dates through customs? well, we assumed, what with the cables from the french well, what i mean was it never occurred to us. before i tell you, let me say something, mr. courtney. something about you. me? yes. for some inexplicable reason, maybe because i can't really understand men like you, i've always wanted to learn about you. but it's impossible. just below that surface of studied courtesy, and the real charles courtney lives beneath that cover, impervious, untouched and unmoved. you're being ridiculous. you live in a quiet little place all of your own, shut off from the rest of the world like some in a forgotten quarter of the globe. are you quite done? no, not quite. i'm going to tell you what really happened the night he was killed. alice west and harrington went down to see if they couldn't get him to change his mind they only succeeded in amusing him. but alice had come prepared, mr. courtney. she held that tiny gun on west just long enough you can imagine harrington's utter shock if only he could have breathed life back into west, he certainly would have done so, no matter what the price to himself. but now there was nothing left but to help alice, you were right about harrington's but not out of nervousness, not to calm his nerves. he deliberately trampled out every one so all you could find were those made by him when she returned that next morning. then he drove away with alice. as soon as they got back to new york, she left him alone to face the consequences. it was like him to do what he did. if ever a man loved a woman, he loved alice west. and, i daresay, she loved him, too, in her own fashion. but she loved her own precious white skin even more. harrington, poor devil, wanted to save the woman. even though she wasn't worth saving, to him she was. you have no proof. proof? the record of customs of her visit to canada. the hotel register in montreal. the fact it was her gun. her accuracy with it. i've seen her shoot the tops off dozens of bottles. the letter that west sent her, her hatred of him. i wanted you to know, mr. courtney. i wanted you to have something to live with through the long, long nights. the taste of defeat that we've known, you will now know. but it has no bitter taste, does it? it has no taste, no taste at all. but it has something else. a weight. it has a pressure and you can feel it pulling down on you. you think i made a mistake? i know you did. impossible. that won't bring harrington back. i don't make mistakes. this time you did. my reputation does not permit mistakes. then your reputation will have to change. nobody must hear of this. do you understand? look, i don't intend to advertise this, but if you ever try to slip the noose around the neck of one of my clients, that's something else. and with that slight exception, your reputation will be safe with me, don't worry. providing our paths don't cross, you mean? i think we understand each other. this has been a terrible shock. but please, before you go, have a nightcap with me. and excuse me a moment. i'll be right back. i think that's got it, mr. courtney. oh, mr. courtney, you were gone almost two years. is there any truth to the rumor that you plan to retire, i shall never retire, sir. all i needed was a long vacation. which monument on your tour impressed you the most? i know you expect me to say the taj mahal, but actually, it was angkor wat in cambodia mr. courtney, there was another rumor. the reason you left new york and were gone so long. that was? that you were searching for the master criminal, someone who could outsmart you. well, now, there no need for modesty, is there, gentlemen? that man hasn't been born. come along, and i'll show you where i do my ceramics. i'd like to take a shot in there if it's okay you know, it's sort of a hobby room that's very apt of you, i must say, you know, the secret of good ceramics you must have a super hot oven. the one i have in there is a most efficient instrument, mr. courtney, is this a souvenir i see there's nothing on the label. that? oh, no, not exactly. as a matter of fact, this particular vase was more or less of an experiment. i used a rather special kind of clay. i regret to inform you that courtney did not retain his last trophy very long. he was caught. a charwoman knocked over the precious vase breaking it into pieces, a few of them identifiable as bits of mr. gregory. you see, the gold fillings in his teeth had resisted but all the good doctors and all the good police couldn't put mr. gregory together again. as for the charwoman, she became the pride here is where the real historical significance ever since, cleaning women the world over have been trying to emulate her success. that's all until next time when we shall be back with another, though imperfect, crime. good night."

cats or dogs? um... cats? oh, i'm so glad you said that. okay, okay. - coffee or tea? - uh, coffee. but only americanos with one shot and preferably from the... i'm convinced that being an only child has made me an introvert. i have always said the same thing. - no way. really? you, too? - yeah. and on christmas morning, my grandma used to make these eggnog pancakes. and i swear they would get - the whole family drunk. - i always wanted to hike the appalachian trail, but i do worry that i'd get dehydrated - and definitely break a toe. - i think i'd worry more about bears. i grew up in this town where you could hear the bells from this church down the street, st. joseph's... i run into the first room i can see, and thank god it's actually a bathroom. no, stop it. - this is too embarrassing, come on. - so... so i pull my pants down. - yeah? - and as soon as that happens... i want you to watch, watch how he puts the cue behind his back. - oh, yes! - i told you - you were gonna like this game! - ball potted! oh, this is the best game in... one thing i have always wondered: what it would be like to live on one of these - cargo ships. - you know, i'm guessing smelly, cold, wet, bad food? want me to keep going? okay, all right, so i am thinking that... ooh, i'm thinking a scoop of mint chip? - can i get one... - no, no, no, no, two scoops! excuse me, can i get two scoops of mint chip, please, sir? thank you very much. you win. you happy? yes! thank you so much. oh, my god! reginald was a dimidian? that was the best season premiere ever. well, actually, that was part two of the kalokagathia-one miniseries. so technically not the season premiere. but, in any case, that's so much better than the trash they're making these days, right? oh. no wonder it's your favorite. yeah, and we can watch all four seasons and the movie together. hey... hey, i have an idea. um, let's... talk. like, like, talk. but we are talking. but, yeah, but i want to be closer to you. maybe... i don't know. but maybe we can meet in person. i, um... it's complicated. - look, i'm tired. - what...? i'll talk to you tomorrow, okay? good night, phil. whoa, hold on, wait, wait, wait. annie? okay. come on. what the hell? annie, you're married? we never said we were exclusive. oh, my god. sorry, that was a... bad joke. - i'm sorry, but... - look... it's-it's-it's, that's such a huge detail to leave out. i guess you looked me up after all, huh? well, yeah... i'm glad i did now, 'cause when were you planning on telling me this? yes. i am married. but i haven't been happy for years. and to be honest, i feel trapped. let's just say... he's not a great guy. and then you come along. it just feels so good to be listened to again. i've... i've never met someone who gets me like you do, phil. me neither. annie? you awake? annie? hi. are you okay? wow. wow, i didn't know if you could hear me if i was talking out loud. that's crazy. i guess i can hear you as long as you're thinking of me, one way or another. i wish you were here. i'm here. hey, you wonder...? you ever wonder why... you're here? bees pollinate flowers and... worms decompose dead things and... i can't think of a reason why i exist. what's my purpose? phil, all of us are here for a reason. including you. call it fate or whatever, but nothing's random. like this connection we have, there's got to be a reason for it, right? it just freaks me out. i'm not... not particularly successful. like talented or... alpha-male hot. i'm just not special in any way, you know? so... why am i here? phil? even if we don't totally understand what the hell we're doing with our lives, one day, we'll look back and we'll see we were following our path. with the way things are in my life right now, if i didn't believe there was something better out there for me, like, i don't know, an escape hatch to happiness or something, i couldn't get out of bed in the morning. phil, i promise you, you do have a purpose. oh, man, i... i have to be at work in three hours, but i just don't want to hang up. me neither. i don't want to be alone. mm-mm. be with me, phil. touch me, phil. oh, annie. annie. my god, these past few weeks, they've... they've been the best weeks of my life. you're like... you're everything i've ever been looking for. i have to meet you, like, today. phil, i never meant for things to get this far. we're in too deep. i need it to stop, phil. annie, no. annie... um, i know you feel this, too, so... it's too dangerous for me. this is special. you s... you said so. it's dangerous. i-i can't do this anymore. i'm sorry, phil, i can't. uh, annie, wait. just plea... annie... annie! annie? oh, god. have you seen this garbage trailer for the new deadstick 2 movie? it's like they... they're-they're not even trying anymore. oh, what the hell? you can't even respond to me like a, like a human being? i get it, dude! you're married! i'm just trying to be friendly! you don't have to be such a bitch! i'm sorry. i'm sorry, i just miss you. come on, no, no. hello? annie? annie? hello, phil? it's mrs. king. third of the month. rent is due. yeah. yeah, i'll get back... i'll get back to you later. hey. hey. hey, i just need to know that this was real. that you were real. please, just say something... to me and i will... i'll leave you alone forever, just say some... please, please, please, please. so, you have, uh, two cats, huh? nope. you sure? i remember you saying... saying something about having two, two cats. yeah, i-i definitely didn't. i'm allergic, so... i feel like you did. um, where did you say you were from, again? uh, here. oh, wow, like the, the city proper? mm-hmm. i never meet anyone who's actually from ashford. you know, everyone claims they're from ashford, but they're really from beaver crest or wherever. you know, florida's the opposite. nobody wants to admit they're from florida. phil? annie? oh, my god, it's so good to hear your voice! oh, god, annie! annie, oh, i miss you so much. life sucks without you. oh, my god, i've been... barely been able to get out of bed. i'm a total wreck, but-but these last few weeks without you have got me thinking, and-and here's the thing, phil: i need you. let's do it. - do what? - let's meet, like you said. wait. y-you're serious? - yes! - wh-what about your husband? i'm tired of waiting. i'm ready for my life to begin, and it, and it can't happen without you. oh, my god! that is the best news ever! halfway between where i am and where you are is exactly in pilson bay. come meet me, phil. let's meet in the middle. ♪ you were made for me ♪ ♪ and nothing more ♪ ♪ guided by your voice ♪ ♪ i see the shore ♪ ♪ yeah, the papers can't report ♪ ♪ what they don't know ♪ ♪ so i'll be all the seasons ♪ ♪ till i'm fall ♪ ♪ if you run away... ♪ i can't believe that in exactly four hours and 12 minutes, i get to finally see your face. i feel like i'm in a fever dream, and i don't ever want to wake up. is this actually happening?

you're going to have to calm down, or i'll be throwing you off at the next stop, and it'll be a lot longer to kingswood than that. - sit down. - yeah. i got it. hey, hey. baby, if you can hear me, i'm coming to save you. excuse me. excuse me. excuse you. watch it. your attention, your attention... horse. horse. horse, horse. um... market. okay, okay! hold on, baby! hey, hey! wait. please. wait, please! please, please. wait. wait, have you seen this woman?

- you, sir, hands where i can see them. - no... - freeze. - don't move. wh-what is happening? he broke into my house! - what? - get on the ground! no. just-just wait. just wait. hey... annie... no! hey, ow! you don't understand, she was in danger! annie, can you hear me? say something! please! i don't know who he is! i've never seen him before. he broke into my house and he attacked my husband. - why... why are you saying that? - please help me! - he attacked my husband! - we've been talking for weeks. - no! - tell them about pilson bay. annie! annie! you want to take this psychopath down to the station, or should i? he's all yours. you owe me. oh, my god. oh, my god. oh, my... she's right. my shrink's right, i'm... i hear voices. i hear voices. i... i traveled halfway across the country for nobody. i killed a random guy! i just, just bashed his face in. i killed a guy. and his daughter, and his poor daughter. it's just me. i'm a murderer. oh, i'm a murderer. it's all me. it was just me. oh, my god! oh... hello, phil. - annie? - oh, god, i've been waiting for this day for a long time. - what? - i told you it was complicated. what are you talking about? this was about a better future for me and audra. thank you so much. i don't understand. what are you... what is happening here? you were my escape hatch, phil. you saved us. now my life can finally begin, all because of you. no. no. no. oh, my god, you are a monster. you... you're... you lied to me! no, not really. all i ever did was tell you what you wanted to hear, and you were willing to kill for it. i told you, you had a purpose. goodbye, phil. no, oh, no! what kind of compromise goes into connecting with another human being? is it meeting in the middle? or going all the way to the end of the line? philip hayes found connection but only with the darkest part of his soul. a region of self that he'll inhabit for the rest of his life. here, in the twilight zone."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"it's my back. let's take a look. it happened this morning when i got out of bed. - i have alvanian spine mites, don't i? - actually... i'll be in pain for the rest of my life. odo... you have a pinched nerve. - really? - it comes from bad posture. me? ridiculous. you've never seen anyone sit so straight. exactly. you carry yourself too rigidly. this is how i've always carried myself. you haven't always had a spinal column. you're not a changeling anymore. you have to learn to relax. - that's what you said last week. - and...? and it helped. that and the prune juice. there. you see? - i know what i'm talking about. - back trouble? - it's none of your concern, quark. - bad posture. - will you get out of here? - you need a good stretching regimen. like worf's morning exercise class. i've got a holosuite program that'll take care of him. - three orion slave girls strap you... - quark... go ahead. suffer. what do you want? a yridian i've been dealing with, sold me something that might interest you. - i don't think so. - you don't even know what it is. i know i don't want it. then how can i get in touch with the founders? i know they'll want it. what are you talking about? it's a changeling. or it was anyway. since it's dead i'll let you have it for five slips of latinum. - it's not dead. - in that case, make it ten. - it's sick. - eight and we'll call it even. it's a pleasure doing business with you. if that is a changeling, maybe we should get it into a security field. - that won't be necessary. - but it could be dangerous. it's not going anywhere, doctor. it doesn't know how. it's just a baby. a baby changeling? my people sent 100 of us out to learn about other races. when i was found, i looked like this. you were this small? like a humanoid child, it will grow. its mass will increase as its shape-shifting abilities develop. it was exposed to a massive amount of tetryon radiation. i'm going to have to purge the isotopes. get on it. are you sure it poses no danger to us, constable? when i was discovered, i didn't know what i was. i had no memory of where i was from. i didn't even know i had the ability to mimic other forms. why would the founders send away such helpless creatures? to see if the species they encountered posed a threat. what better way to gauge another race than to see how it treats the weak? i see your point. how long before it is able to take humanoid form? several months. why? there's a lot we don't know about your people. changelings could provide us with information about the dominion. i'd like to be allowed to work with it, to teach it how to shape-shift. i can't think of anyone better qualified. you might just want a little help. you should contact dr mora. mora? why? he managed to communicate with you. he knows what he's doing. maybe so but i'd prefer to do this alone. it's your call. but it's always nice to have someone around to help change the diapers. i'll keep that in mind. the purge was almost 100% effective. the concentration of isotopes is nearly negligible. it certainly looks healthier. i'd better go and check on kira. did you hear? she's in labour. but i guess you have your own baby to think about. there is still instability in its morphogenic matrix. i'm hoping it will level out. the computer will monitor for biomimetic fluctuations. - thank you, doctor. - good luck. how do you feel? better? i realise you can't understand a word i'm saying, but that doesn't matter. i know you're aware of me. you see, i was once like you. i spent months in a lab being prodded and poked by a scientist who didn't recognise i was a life-form. he thought i was a specimen, a mystery that needed to be unravelled. he never talked to me. it didn't occur to him. i didn't know what i was... or what i was supposed to do. i was lost. alone. but it's not going to be that way with you. no, i'm not going to make the same mistakes that were made with me. come on. i want to show you something. i'm sorry. something's wrong. kira said this would only take about an hour. for bajoran women, giving birth is all about being relaxed. he's right. that's why it's so important for us to keep the rhythm. she won't relax until shakaar gets here. i called him almost six hours ago. only takes half that time to make the trip from bajor. he's the first minister. he's very busy. and so am i. i have three surgeries scheduled this afternoon. i'll try and pop by later. y'pora... the baby is moving. relax. breathe. it won't be long now. - sorry i'm late. how are you? - all right. - i threw you off, didn't i? - i'll get back on track. i'm glad you're here. this is the replimat. humanoids come here to eat. they... we, rather, need to ingest nutrients. this is my home. it's a space station. people of many different species live here together. when you've learned to change shape, i'll show you everything. you can live here, too. it's a fascinating place. constable, why are you talking to your beverage? it's not a beverage. it's a changeling. excuse me, commander. there we go, huh? doesn't that feel better? nothing like spreading yourself out after being cooped up in a jar. you have no idea of the marvels that are in store for you. do you know what you are? you're a changeling. a shape-shifter. you can be anything. a tarkalean hawk soaring through the sky or a filian python burrowing deep beneath the ground. it's all yours for the taking. i was never a very good shape-shifter. if you could see the face i'm stuck with you'd know what i mean. but i think i can be a good teacher. you'll be better than i ever was. and i promise i'll never treat you the way i was treated. never. - odo! - dr mora. what are you doing here? i heard about the changeling. i came to help. remarkable. you know, it's much larger than you were. is that about a quarter of a litre? - i suppose so. - you didn't measure it? what difference does it make how large it is? it could make a great deal of difference. size could indicate that it's already exercised its ability to shape-shift. i thought you were on earth working with starfleet on new ways to detect changeling infiltrators. hm. fortunately i was visiting my parents on bajor when i got the news of your find. - how are you, odo? i've been worried. - worried? your people took away your ability to shape-shift. thank you for your concern but i'm fine. i knew you'd say that. you never want to give anything away, even though it's all right there in your face. let's get started. we have a lot of work ahead of us. - actually... - i told starfleet i'd be here for weeks. that was premature. it'll take that long to get the changeling to respond. don't do that! i see you still have trouble controlling your temper. i was just trying to determine its mass. dr mora, i understand that you want to help. - but i'm going to do this alone. - alone? you don't know a thing about teaching a changeling how to shape-shift. then i'll just muddle through somehow. you did. it's too warm in here. a changeling's morphogenic matrix is most malleable at 17 degrees celsius. i used to be able to change shape in almost any temperature. that's true. but why not make it easy for the changeling? it took me weeks to figure out the optimal temperature, the humidity, even the light levels. don't you think that's information you could use? i suppose i could look at your reports. feel free to, of course. except i never kept extensive records. i always wanted to move on to the next test. believe me, i remember your tests very well. so that's what this is about. you still resent the things i did to induce you to shape-shift. i know they weren't pleasant but really, odo, i would hope that you would get past that by now. i am disappointed. i have my own ideas about how to teach the changeling. - i imagine they're less invasive. - exactly. - you don't think that i can do it. - i didn't say that. as a matter of fact i'd be fascinated to see what you have in mind. in that case, why don't you stay and observe? if you insist. - what's wrong? - i don't know. it was like a cramp. you shouldn't be feeling any pain. well... you're not going to be having the baby today. - what? - you were in labour too long. i wonder why. for whatever reason, you weren't able to fully relax. you stopped producing endorphins so they wouldn't become toxic. - when will she have the baby? - it could be a few more days. - or a few more weeks. - weeks? if i don't have this baby soon, i'll go out of my mind. if you want, you can go see dr bashir and have him... no, i want to have this baby the traditional bajoran way. we're a 100% behind you, nerys. - right, miles? - absolutely. can you stay? i'll have to rearrange my schedule but i think so. nerys, return to your quarters and rest. i'll come by and see you later. you. be punctual next time or don't come at all. and you? practice. this is a sphere. it's one of the most basic forms in nature. see how it rolls? interesting, isn't it? you're in my light. now... this won't hurt a bit. here we are. here we go. yeah. yeah. yeah! now. this is also a sphere. feel its symmetry, the softness of its shape. the sameness. now, you try. there we are. i understand that you prefer to remain shapeless. believe me, i remember how relaxing it could be. but you have to learn to take other forms. that's what changelings do. it can be immensely rewarding. i remember the first time dr mora here coerced me into taking the shape of a cube with one of his electrostatic gadgets. once i did it, and he turned the infernal thing off, i was perfectly content to stay a cube for hours. it was fascinating, all those right angles. of course, he had other plans. before i knew it, he had me spinning around in a centrifuge. well... if you're not interested in a sphere right now, we can always try a cube. what do you think? all right. now... this is a pyramid. it's one of the most mysterious shapes in nature. now... mr pyramid, here comes mr cube. what are you doing? i'm measuring its volume. it's been here a week, and it's only grown 17%. after three days in my lab, you were twice that size. maybe i was anxious to grow up so i could get out of there. my point is, you've made no progress. by this time, you'd mimicked half a dozen simple forms. i am trying to gain its confidence, not teach it tricks. it's a shame you're not a changeling any more. you could link with it and teach it everything. - you make it sound like it's my fault. - it might very well be. let's face it. your shape-shifting ability was limited. maybe that's why your people could force you to take a humanoid form. - that is pure speculation. - let's find out. you are just dying to get me into one of your contraptions. - i'm trying to help. - i won't submit myself to another round of your experiments. everything i did to you was for your own good. true, some of the tests that i subjected you to proved inconclusive. the vacuum chamber springs to mind. the cytoplasmic separator. come to think of it, the protein decompiler as well. how could i know until i tried? by the prophets, odo, i wasn't even sure you were a life-form. - i wasn't sure about you either. - once i realised you were sentient the cardassians wanted to know all about you. i was under enormous pressure to come up with results, and i did. my technique worked. the fact that you are standing here proves it. you enjoyed watching me suffer. you really believe that? how pathetic. if it wasn't for me, you'd still be sitting on a shelf somewhere, in a beaker labelled ""unknown sample"". if it wasn't for me, you'd be a nobody. starfleet wouldn't hire you to judge a science fair. i'm getting tired of watching you but i can't pull myself away. i can't wait to see what next preposterous thing you're going to try. who knows? maybe in a couple of months it may get so tired of your incessant chatter that it might actually do something. you'd love to get your hands on it. you could sell tickets. ""dr mora's chamber of horrors, open for business. ""right this way!"" - captain. - how's it going, gentlemen? - making progress, sir. - i'm glad to hear it. i was just talking with starfleet command. they want you to communicate with the changeling as soon as possible. at the rate we're going that is still a long way off. if it's too long starfleet is going to want to take over the project. sir... as long as you're making progress there's nothing to worry about. by the way... starfleet wants you to file daily reports for their review. - understood, sir. - carry on. now you understand the kind of pressure i was going through. i brought my old equipment from bajor. maybe it's time we started unpacking. anytime you're ready. don't worry. you're going to get through this all right. oh, no. i'm just an observer here. the changeling won't respond to anything less than six millivolts. there must be some other way. spare the rod, spoil the child. without discomfort, the changeling will be perfectly comfortable to remain in its gelatinous state. it'll just lie there, never realising it has the ability to mimic other forms, never living up to its potential. six millivolts won't hurt it. once it realises there's no charge in the centre, the procedure will be finished. checking to see if i'm enjoying myself? that's it. you've found it! i smiled the first time you did that. little did i realise you would end up hating me for it. - shall we move on? - why not? edon. - how you feeling? - my feet are a little swollen. a little? they've never been this bad. there's a zero-grav tumbling performance tonight. - do you want to go? - maybe. you can't go standing around for an hour. would you leave us alone for a minute? - i'm almost done. - i'll take over. - i think it's time. - you got to do it harder. - i know what i'm doing. - it's time. - and you got to work up the legs. - it's time! if i were you, i'd hold this shape. otherwise, you'll be in for a little shock. wait a minute. i had to try that three times before you caught on. actually, the first two times i didn't hold my shape on purpose. you're not serious. i suppose i didn't want to give you the satisfaction. someday, if you're very lucky, this changeling will give you the satisfaction of saying, ""thank you very much. you did so much for me."" then again... it may leave the way you did. it will announce that it's striking out on its own and you will never... hear from it again. i'm going to get something to eat. - i mean, the eyes... - when he rose up... - ...the eyes are incredible! - ...i thought he'd say something! put that down! we're celebrating. i've fallen behind in my reports over these last few days. - aren't you excited by what happened? - of course i am. tomorrow, we can expose the changeling to some simple life-forms - some algae, some fungus. in a few more days, maybe an invertebrate. i can't wait until i can communicate with it. there's so much i want it to see, so much i want to share. you may get that chance soon. the changeling is developing far faster than you did. i don't mean that as a criticism. it's a compliment. i was wrong. your approach to the changeling was sound. don't you see? it's reaching out to you. it's curious about you. the first time you did anything like that was when you formed a tentacle to slap my hand. i remember. i wanted you to stop zapping me. you formed a connection with this changeling. i was never able to do that with you. that's not true. i respected you. you feared me. you didn't know what i was. you were experimenting on what looked like a lump of organic residue. that's what i'd still be if it weren't for you. you don't know how much it means to me to hear you say that. i'm sorry. i know this kind of talk makes you uncomfortable. but if i hadn't poked and prodded you so much you may have grown up with a less forbidding disposition. something tells me no matter what we do to that changeling it's going to have a more pleasant disposition than mine. it's just the way i am. i'll leave you to your work. dr mora? two glasses of champagne, please. we're celebrating. the baby has turned. it's time. - awake, child. - we await you with love. and welcome you into the world. - why don't you stay there? - i can't see! - exactly. - it's my baby. - it would make nerys uncomfortable. - what? - she's been living in my home. - be quiet. - what do you mean? - i missed molly's birth. - i am not going to miss this one. - i'm trying to have a baby. i am sick of this ridiculous little competition between the two of you. if one of you says one more word, you're going to have to leave. - fine, just tell him to... - that's it. out, both of you. kira... - you're joking. - does it look like she's joking? out! - nice going. - oh, do me a favour. next time you have a baby leave my girlfriend out of it, huh? comes to... 324. i'm going to have to start watering the drinks again. constable? - quark! - what are you doing? - what does it look like? - we're closed. have a seat. - you're in a good mood. - yes, i am. which means you're probably about to arrest me on some trumped-up charge. not at all. i am buying you a drink. why? dr mora has gone to sleep, and i... still feel like celebrating. what are you up to? i am happy, quark. can't you just accept that? no. it doesn't fit. if you're happy there's something wrong in the world. - the centre cannot hold. - there we go. i've got it. you're getting back at me for selling you that sick changeling. actually, i should thank you. if you want the money back, just say so. it changed my life. here's to you, quark. all right, i confess. i don't know what i did, but i did it. just stop. i can't take it anymore. do you ever think about having children? i never did. it seemed like too much trouble. but then fate... dropped one into my lap and i couldn't be happier. cheers. over the past few months, i came to accept that i'd never have contact with my people again. they turned me into a humanoid. part of me was lost forever. but that... little ball of goo back in the lab changed everything. i feel as if i'm experiencing what it is... to be a changeling again. and somehow... being a solid doesn't seem so bad anymore. fill me up. 'computer to odo, please acknowledge.' go ahead. ""the life-form being monitored is displaying biomimetic fluctuations.' have dr mora meet me in the science lab. what's happened? its morphogenic matrix is destabilising. it's dying. its life signs are fading. the radiation must have damaged it. - do something! - you might try an enzymatic induction. that might stabilise the fluctuations. - it's worth a shot. - it has to work. please, wait outside. we'll do everything we can. i feel... so good. you're doing great, nerys. here he comes. keiko, would you do me a favour? kira said you can both come back in if you promise to behave. - oh, after you. - oh, no. after you. - please... - get in here! you'll miss everything. that's it, nerys. relax. let it come. that's right. breathe. look at him, miles. he's beautiful. there's nothing we could do. i'm sorry, odo. it won't be very long now. please, don't die. there's so much i want to show you. i was going to teach you how to be a tarkalean hawk, remember? - where did it go? - it integrated itself into odo's body. odo, what's wrong? - it can't be! - what? this might be a good time to take some leave and come down to bajor. maybe in a few weeks. right now i feel like staying here. so you can be close to the baby. - he's a good-looking boy. - he is, isn't he? 'shuttle 4709 for bajor now departing.' you'd better go. i have a few minutes left. how does it feel to be yourself again? i just wish it hadn't happened the way it did. i am sorry. if it helps... think of it as a gift. something the changeling wanted you to have. i think i finally understand how much i meant to you... and what you must have gone through when i left. you had to find your own way in the world. i should have included you in my life. you still can. take care of yourself, odo. i thought the o'briens were having a party. shakaar and i stopped by. i didn't feel much like celebrating. i got into this because the o'briens needed me. i never wanted a baby. but now? i just wish i could hold him in my arms... and never let him go. i think i know how you feel, nerys. - want to take a walk? - yeah. english"
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"it is so typical of oxford to start its new year in the autumn. i feel positively one hundred years old. i was given a talking to by monsignor bell this afternoon, my tutor yesterday and the junior dean, and now i've got to face mr samgrass of all souls. that will make the fourth in two days. who's mr samgrass of all souls? just someone of mummy's. they all say that i made such a bad start last year that i've been noticed and that if i do not mend my ways i shall have to be sent down. oh, charles, what's happened to us since last term? i feel so old. i feel positively middle-aged, which is infinitely worse. well, i'm glad we had this little talk. your mother will be so pleased. would you care for a glass of sherry? i think i shall indulge in one myself. thank you. did your mother tell you that i am doing a little work for her? you know it was she who felt so keenly that we should meet. she did tell you, didn't she? she may have done. i really can't remember. well, i must go. she has entrusted me with the compilation of a memorial work on her brother ned. i say work, but, of course, it gives me immense pleasure. and what a delight to work at brideshead, quite my favorite house in england. i'm glad you like it. i have an essay to write. yes, of course. well, remember what i've said. i am sure we shall enjoy our exploration together and you know that any success in the fields of academe would bring great pleasure to your mother. yes, thank you. goodbye. goodbye, sebastian. mr samgrass and his little talks were to play an increasingly large part in our lives. sebastian spoke less than the truth when he described him as someone of mummy's. he was someone of almost everyone who possessed something to attract him. i'm supposed to mend my ways, charles. i mean, how does one mend one's ways? join the league of nations union? read ""isis"" every week? drink coffee every morning at the cadena café? that would be a start. you could smoke a great pipe and play hockey and go to tea on boar's hill. yes, yes and i could go to lectures at keble. i could buy one of those little bicycles with a tray of books on it. i could drink cocoa every evening and discuss sex seriously. very seriously. anthony blanche has gone down. he wrote me a letter. he said he's taken a flat in munich and started a relationship with a policeman. i shall miss him. yes. i shall, too in a way. anthony blanche had taken something away with him when he went. he had locked a door and hung the key on his chain. all his friends, among whom he had always been a stranger needed him now. sebastian and i kept very much to our own company that term each so much bound up in the other that we did not need to look elsewhere for friends. my cousin jasper had told me it was normal to spend one's second year shaking off the friends of one's first and it happened as he had said. most of my friends were those i had made through sebastian and together we shed them and made no others. i kept to tenuous connection with the history school wrote my two essays a week and attended the occasional lecture. thus, soberly dressed and happily employed i became a fairly respectable man in my college. and that is how lady marchmain found us when early in that michaelmas term she came for a week to oxford. mr ryder. a lady's been here, asking for you. she left this message. thank you, oakes. i am so pleased to have found you, charles. i may call you charles? of course. i feel i know you so well from sebastian. i've just had luncheon with him and mr samgrass. do you know who i mean? you may have met. he's a very clever history don at all souls. he's been taking a great interest in sebastian. yes, i heard. i hope sebastian will appreciate his interest. i was so sorry to have missed you when you were at brideshead. everyone loves your paintings in the garden room. well, it was very kind of you to let me stay so long. i think it was sebastian who was fortunate to have you with him all that time. is it true, as mr samgrass tells me that you're my son's only friend this term? well, some people have gone down i suppose perhaps i am. we do spend a lot of time together. i'm glad of it. i'm sure i have reason to be grateful to you, charles, too. friendships like yours can be such a help. she accepted me as sebastian's friend and sought to make me hers also and in doing so unwittingly struck at the roots of our friendship. that is the single reproach i have to set against her abundant kindness to me. one morning, a week or two later julia arrived in oxford, driven by a man whom she introduce as mr mottram and addressed as rex. they both joined a small lunch party in my rooms. one of the last of the old kind that i gave. how much was it? oh, just a few guineas. so the h.r.h. ended up having to pay me he can't have been more than thirty at the time we met him but rex seemed very old to us in oxford. he'd arrived from canada after the war had become a member of parliament a gambler and a good fellow. lucky with money. you must remember, mr ryder, he's a colonial aren't you, darling? he's never been to any sort of university. lucky you. well, it just means you start life about three years behind the other fellow. and rex has never stayed anywhere for three years have you, darling? he's told me some very rich stories indeed. i remember one about two undergraduates and a goose. rex knows everyone. damn! my cigarettes. rex? don't worry. i'll get them. they are in the car. excuse me, gentlemen. julia treated him as she seemed to treat all the world with mild disdain, but with an air of possession. look, i'm helping to organize a ghastly charity ball in london next month. you two absolutely must come. rex is having a dinner party first. i don't see why we should. oh, but you must. the trouble with rex is he doesn't know anybody young. all his friends are leathery old sharks in the city and dreary mps. well, we'll see. come on charles. sorry. lunt's been playing games with my cufflinks. boy, you're not coming, are you? yes, aren't i? delighted dear boy, delighted. i suppose i shall have to go in the back. i suppose you realise that this going to be the most stupefyingly boring ball of the season? oh, i don't know. i haven't been to many balls this season. it's so dreary this term, anything would make a change. dont drive like this. it makes me sick, sebastian and i would spend the night at marchmain house, so we went there to dress and while we dressed drank a bottle of champagne. one, two, three. i can't do it! try. but you're holding me you can't haul me around like that! god, julia. you're not even changed. i know. i'm going to be horribly late. you'd better go on to rex's without me. you're very tedious. it's heavenly of you to come. we're all going to be hideously bored. well, don't be too long. keep them happy. i say where on earth is julia? how should i know? probably gone to have dinner somewhere else. gosh! it's her dance. but how will she get there without us? she'll be all right. oh, rex, that absurd jeroboam. why must you have everything so big? won't be too big for us. now listen you chaps, let's chuck this ghastly dance and go to ma mayfield's. who's ma mayfield? you know ma mayfield. everyone knows ma mayfield of the old hundredth, the best club in town. i've got a regular there, a sweet little thing named effie. there'd be the devil to pay if she heard i'd been to london and hadn't been to see her. so come and meet effie at ma mayfield's. all right, let's go and see effie at ma mayfield's. we'll need another bottle of pop off the good mottram cut the bloody ball and then go straight to ma mayfield's. look who's here. at last! sorry. brenda. i'm so glad you didn't let him hold dinner up for me. it's his canadian courtesy. well, thank god you're here. at last we can go. this is all very well, but are you sure you know where this place is? of course i do, 100 sink street. it's just off leicester square. we'll take the car. aren't we going to look in at the ball? oh charles! if you've seen one ball you've seen them all. but i want to dance you can dance at ma mayfield's. not the same sort of dancing. you had better not drive. i'll drive i know the way like the back of my hand. jump in. ready? yes. how do you turn the bally lights off? ask hardcastle. good evening. are you members? you want to keep out of there. you'll be poisoned and given a dose. and given a dose. you members? you members? my name is mulcaster. viscount mulcaster. i'm an old friend of his mum. all right. try inside. you'll be robbed and poisoned and infected and robbed. you're not members here, are you dearie? i say, that really is the limit! i'm extremely well known here. you ought to know me by now. yes, dearie. ten bob each. that's absolutely ridiculous. i've never had to pay to get in here before. you're lucky dearie. we're full up. anyone who comes in after you is going to have to pay a quid. look, i insist. let me speak to mrs. mayfield at once. you're speaking, dearie. i am mrs. mayfield. well, ma. i really am it's so dark in here i didn't recognize you in your finery. you know me, don't you? boy mulcaster! that's all right, duckie. just give us your ten bob each! alright chaps. i'll do it. is effie here this evening? who's effie? effie, one of the girls who's always here. they've got lots of girls working here, some of them's dark, some of them's fair. some you might call pretty. i haven't got the time to notice. thirty bob. i say that's a bit steep. i'm going to try and find effie. cigarette? thanks. come on, we're wasting our time. they're only fairies. look you fellows i've found her. this is effie. lord sebastian flyte, charles ryder. effie can you give some toast? thank you. that's another six bob! it's the first bite i've had all evening you know. the only decent thing about this place is the breakfast. you get fair peckish hanging about. i seen you here before often haven't i? i'm afraid not. then it must be you i seen before. i should rather hope so. you haven't forgotten our little evening in september, have you? no, darling. you were the boy in the guards who cut your toe, wasn't you? now, don't tease, effie! oh lord i know! you were with bunty that time we were raided and we all hid behind the dustbins. effie loves pulling my leg. she's cross with me for having stayed away so long. aren't you, effie? well, i know ive seen you somewhere before. effie, stop teasing. please. i wasn't meaning to. do you want to dance? not just at the moment. thank god for that! my shoes are pinching me something terrible tonight. for the lady, sir. thank you very much. that's thirty bob. thank you, sir. cheers. cheers. we're under attack. oh lord. death's head and the sickly child. tell them to go away. ladies, dear ladies. would you care to dance with my friend and i? well if you really want to we don't mind, do we? we thought you were fairies at first, didn't we? yeah when you came in, we both said, those two are fairies didn't we, renee? yeah, well that's what we said. well that's what you looked like. that was because of our extreme youth. and our extraordinary physical beauty. i think you're very sweet really. i think you're very sweet too. how about a little party? jus the six of us over at my place? certainly. boy! we're off to a party just the six of us. this very charming young lady says she's got somewhere to go. i must go and tell mrs. mayfield we're going out. come on, effie. it was still early. not long after midnight when we regained the street. the commissioner had tried to persuade us to take a taxi but we pile into hardcastle's car and there laid our mistake. let me out of this. i'm sorry if i am impeding the traffic, officer but the young lady insisted upon my stopping so that she could get out. she would take no denial. as you will have observed she was pressed for time. a matter of nerves. let me talk to him. be a sport, handsome, no one's seen anything but you. the boys don't mean no harm. i'll get them into a taxi and see them home alright. look here, my good man there's no need for you to notice anything. we've all been to ma mayfield's. i reckon ma mayfield pays you a pretty good retainer to keep your eyes shut. well, you can keep your eyes shut on us as well and you won't be the loser by it. my god, you'll pay for this! do you know who i am? i am the viscount mulcaster! my father's the ninth earl! open this door! i insist on seeing a doctor! telephone the home secretary. send for my solicitor. charles, are you there? yes. i am here. this is a hell of a business. i tell you the person to send for, rex mottram. he'd be in his element here. well, you understand sir, we had to do our duty. of course, sergeant. this is an outrage. i demand my legal rights. it was for their protection, sir. i'm sure you did the right thing, sergeant. we decided to let the young ladies go, sir. cigar? thank you very much, sir. sergeant do you think we could keep this incident between ourselves? no, sir. i'm afraid it's too late for that. the report's already gone upstairs and we've taken the young ladies' names as witnesses. i see. mottram, i intend to sue for wrongful arrest. tell him! be a good fellow, mulcaster. leave all the talking to me. is there anything else, sergeant? yes, sir. if you'd like to complete the formalities sign for the sureties. and if you gentlemen would like to sign for your possessions. sign there please, sir. thank you, sergeant. thank you sergeant good night. it had better be all there! we had all slept that night at rex's flat. thank you. in the morning, the display was impressive. he called a man on thrompos to shave us while his valet collected our clothes from marchmain house. rex joined us after breakfast. good morning, gentlemen. i trust you are feeling a little better. this is mr selwyn who will be representing you. lord sebastian flyte. how do you do? good morning. mr charles ryder. how do you do? how do you do? lord mulcaster. how do you do? hello. please sit down, selwyn. thank you. sebastian's in a jam. he's liable for anything up to six month's imprisonment for being drunk in charge of a car. unfortunately, you'll come up before grigg. he takes a grim view of cases of this sort. now, all that will happen this morning is that we shall ask to have sebastian's case held over for a week to prepare his defense. but you two will plead guilty say you're sorry and pay your five bob fine. i'll see what can be done about squaring things with the evening papers. though ""the star' could be difficult. now, this is important remember to keep out all mention of the old hundredth. now, luckily the tarts were sober and so they're not being charged but they've taken their names. if we try and break down the police evidence they'll be called and used as witnesses. we must avoid that at all costs. right, mulcaster? good. we have to swallow the police story whole and appeal to the magistrates' better nature not to wreck a young man's career for the sake of a single boyish indiscretion. it'll all work out alright. now, we shall need a don to give evidence of good character. julia tells me you have a tame one called samgrass. he'll do. meanwhile, you story is simply that you came up from oxford for a perfectly respectable dance were not used to wine had too much and then lost the way driving home. well, let's take care of this and then see about fixing things with the authorities up in oxford. everything happened at court as rex had predicted. at half past ten that morning, we stood outside bow street magistrates' court. mulcaster and i had paid our fines and were free men. sebastian was bound over to appear in a week's time. five bob is monstrous. they should have cleared us. they put themselves totally in the wrong when they refused to call my solicitor. i don't see why they should get away with it. mulcaster, it's all over now. anyway, i'm off to the city. my great uncle's just snuffed it. taxi! i suppose mummy's got to hear about it. damn! damn! damn! it's cold. why don't we just go back to oxford and wait for them to bother us? why don't we telephone julia? i think i'll go abroad. my dear sebastian, all you're going to be is fined a couple of quid and given a stiff talking-to. yes, but it's all the bother mummy and bridey and the family and the dons. i think i'd rather go to prison. i mean, if i just slip away abroad, they can't do anything about it, can they? can they? yes, they can. that's what people do when they're being chased by the police. i know mummy's going to make it seem she has to bear the whole brunt of the business. why don't we call julia, arrange to meet and talk it over with her? well, you are a pair of pickles. good morning, julia. i must say you look remarkably well on it. the only time i got tight i was paralyzed all the next day. i do think you might have taken me with you. the ball was positively lethal and i've always longed to go to the old hundredth. no one will ever take me. is it heaven? you know about that too? rex telephoned me this morning and told me everything. what were your girl friends like? now, don't be prurient. well, mine was like a skull. mine was like a consumptive. goodness. does mummy know? not about your skulls and consumptives. she knows you were in the clink. i told her. she was divine about it, of course. it's mummy's being divine about everything that worries me the most. i can't think why you went and stayed with mr mottram. you might have come and told me about it first. well, it wasnt really very much chance, mama. i am sorry if how am i going to explain this to the family? they will be so surprised to find that they're more upset about it than i am. do you know my sister-in-law, fanny roscommon? she has always thought i brought my children up badly. now i'm beginning to think she must be right. mr samgrass do you think it would be any use if i spoke to the chancellor? well, lady marchmain, i've already spoken to msgr bell and persuaded him to call on the dean she's been perfectly charming. i don't see what you were so worried about. i can't explain. mr samgrass, how long have you known lord sebastian flyte? since he first came up to oxford. i am an old friend of the defendant's mother, lady marchmain. what impression have you formed of his character? i would describe him to you, sir as a model student. my deep regret is that a brilliant university career may now be at stake. is this type of incident in his character at all, would you say? i would say it was entirely out of character. to my certain knowledge, lord sebastian has always conducted his life at the house with the most studious application. the evidence is that the defendant came up to london to attend a charitable function, organized by his sister. that is correct, sir. it was a highly respectable affair i believe the explanation to be lord sebastian, sir is simply unused to wine. the law of england is the same for an oxford undergraduate as it is for any young hooligan. indeed the better the home, the more outrageous the offence. it is purely by good chance that you do not bear the responsibility for a serious accident. but for mr samgrass's evidence, i would feel disposed to give you an exemplary prison sentence. however, i have accepted that you are unused to wine. there will be a fine of ten pounds. the usher will show you where to pay. we were both gated for the rest of the term but the most lasting penalty we suffered was our intimacy with rex mottram and mr samgrass. but since rex's life was in london in a world of politics and high finance and mr samgrass's nearer to our own at oxford it was from him we suffered more. for the rest of that term he haunted us. 11 minutes and 15 seconds. a marked improvement. if they want to treat us like a pair of criminals we can behave like criminals. good evening, sebastian ah, charles! i don't think we've been spotted. how delightful. did i tell you i've been invited to brideshead for christmas? your mother wrote me the most charming letter. charles, how good to see you. you find me in solitary possession. how are you? very well. i gather sebastian's gone out hunting. yes. we've had a lawn meet of the marchmain hounds a deliciously archaic spectacle all our young friends are in pursuit of the fox. i've been spending a cozy afternoon by the fire. sebastian, you will not be surprised to hear looked remarkably elegant in his pink coat. would you like some tea? your arrival emboldens me to ring for some. is lady marchmain in? no. she's driven off with her cousins to visit a neighbour. she'll be back in time for dinner. how can i prepare you for the party? alas, it breaks up tomorrow. lady julia departs to celebrate the new year elsewhere and takes the beau-monde with her. i shall miss the pretty creatures about the house particularly one, celia. she's the sister of our old companion in adversity boy mulcaster, and wonderfully unlike him. i find her most engaging. i shall miss her for i do not go tomorrow. how long are you staying? oh, well into the new year. and you, charles? i don't know. tomorrow i start in earnest on our hostess's book. thank you which, believe me, is a treasure house of period gems. ah, the intrepid hunter returns. hello. when did you get here? about an hour ago. had a good day? where are the others, sebastian? i got fed up so i hacked back. i'm going up to change. come up and talk to me charles, will you? well, no doubt see you later, mr samgrass. we went to chapel three times on christmas day. mummy found some eunuchs to sing high mass. it sounded very peculiar. well, we had the village choir bawling at us from the minstrels' gallery and cousin jasper dragooned us into playing endless games of bridge. will i know anybody who's here? no. i shouldn't think so. they're all people of mummy's and julia's. they'll all be there at tea. hello, sebastian. see what i mean? an absolute zoo. charles! you've arrived! hello. hello, cordelia. did you have a good christmas? quiet. i'm going to ask mummy if i can stay up specially late tonight in honour of your arrival. oh, that'll be fun. sebastian, what happened to you? oh, i got bored. well, you missed the best part again. we had the most tremendous gallop across spring fields six jumps to platts wood and i only just managed to stay on. well, we all know how brave you are. well, i'm braver than you and i've only go mr beelzebub. oh, sebastian, good to see you. hello. quite a good day's sport. i think the hounds got on much better form after we dragged thaxton wood. i thought they pressed very hard, probably why we made the kill. ah, ryder, how are you? hello bridey. very well, thanks. when did you get here? oh, sebastian, what happened to you after you left the home woods? i came back early. i looked all over the place for you. excuse me. our hostess has just returned. she was asking if you had arrived yet. you'll find her in her sitting room. ah, thank you. i'm just going along to say hello to you mother. why? you'll see her this evening. well, you know. i'll see you later. i'm delighted charles has joined the party. it augurs well, i feel, this reunion of ours in your mother's house. i look forward to our time together. did you enjoy your christmas? yes, yes. i did. thank you. i hope you've both managed to settle down after the 'incident'. back at oxford, i mean. i gather your penance hasn't been too harsh. we were gated, but i expect you realise that we've mr samgrass to thank for that i mean that the pair of you weren't more severely dealt with. he's worked extraordinarily hard, you know, on our behalf. he saw the proctor, the vice-chancellor. he got monsignor bell to call the dean. yes, i know. well, that's all over now, isn't it? i must make a short visit to the chapel before dinner. i don't suppose i can persuade you to come. we must make a catholic of you, charles. religion predominated in the house not only in its practices, the daily mass and rosary morning and evening in the chapel but in all its intercourse. who's coming to chapel for the rosary? well, i think i'd better look after charles. i must have my bath at once, mummy. i'm filthy. i'll come. i can change later. may i come too, lady marchmain if you don't mind? of course not. father? certainly, lady marchmain. what did mummy say? oh, she spent most of the time singing samgrass's praises and reminding me of our obligation to him. how he saw the vice chancellor and the proctor. yes, i've had all that too. i do wish samgrass would go. i'm sick of being grateful to him. yes. thank god, at least julia's lot are going tomorrow. goodbye, charles. a happy new year! oh, julia darling, i forgot your present oh, that's alright goodbye tom, goodbye margaret, goodbye bobby. see you later. see you all at polly's if we don't get there by midnight, happy new year. hold on, tom! come on charles. we remained at brideshead leading our own life. i had no mind then for anything except sebastian. and i saw him already as being threatened though i did not yet know how black was the threat. his constant, despairing prayer was to be let alone. and since he counted among the intruders his own conscience and all claims of human affection his days in arcadia were numbered. he did not fail in love, but he lost the joy of it for i was no longer part of his solitude. as my intimacy with the family grew i became part of the world he sought to escape. i became one of the bonds which held him. that was the part for which his mother in our little talks, was seeking to fit me. you have so many beautiful things. you know, charles, when i was a girl, we were comparatively poor but still much richer than most of the world and when i married i became very rich. it used to worry me. i thought it wrong to have so many beautiful things when others had nothing. now i realise that it's possible for the rich to sin by coveting the privileges of the poor. can you see that? perhaps. the poor have always been the favourites of god and his saints, but i believe that it's one of the special achievements of grace to sanctify the whole of life. riches included. wealth in pagan rome was necessarily something cruel. it's not anymore. but i thought that it was supposed to be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. it's very unexpected for a camel to go through the eye of a needle but then, the gospel is simply a catalogue of unexpected things. it's not to be expected that an ox and an ass should worship at the crib. animals are always doing the oddest things in the lives of the saints. it's all part of the poetry the alice-in-wonderland side of religion. ready! pull! ready! pull! hello. where have you been all morning? with your mother. oh god. another of her little talks. i can't help it if she thinks i'm ripe for conversion. ready! pull! you shouldn't encourage her. she can be very determined. and i can be very stubborn. you needn't worry about me. ready! pull! oh god, look at him. charles, i don't think i can take another day of this. why don't we go away somewhere? where? oh, i don't know. paris, buenos aires, new york bayswater? i think i'd settle for bayswater. do you think your father will have us? i don't think he'd even notice us. after tea then? after tea. come on sammy. ready! pull! ah, charles. i've just been telling sebastian i've made the most interesting discovery. really? pull? oh, sorry. that term at oxford we took up again that life that seemed to be shrinking in the cool air. the sadness, that had been strong in sebastian the term before gave place to a kind of sullenness, even towards me. he was sick at heart somewhere. i did not know how and i grieved for him, unable to help. when he was happy now, it was usually because he was drunk. and when drunk, he developed an obsession for mocking mr samgrass. samgrass, green arse all this, mr samgrass took in good part. as though each outrage in some way strengthen his hold in sebastian. it was during this term that i began to realise that sebastian was a drunkard in quite a different sense to myself. sebastian, it's me. are you there? sebastian, are you alright? what's the matter? can i help? i got drunk often. but through an access of high spirit and the love of the moment and the wish to belong and enhance it. sebastian drank to escape. nothing's the matter. as we together grew older and more serious, i drank less, he more. then, a succession of disasters came upon him so swiftly there's nothing to be done. and with such unexpected violence that it is hard to say when exactly i realised my friend was in deep trouble. but i knew it well enough in the easter vacation at brideshead. charles, go away."

[vehicles humming] [footsteps] morning, mr perkins. thank you. [music playing] roald dahl (voiceover): five days a week, for 36 years, william perkins had been taking the 8:12 train to the city. he liked the process of commuting. there is a regularity about it that is agreeable and comforting to a person of habit. and in addition, it served as a sort of slipway, launching him gently but firmly into the waters of his daily business routine. one of his special little pleasures was to have his own particular seat, in the same compartment, with the same good, solid people sitting in their right places, with the right umbrellas, and hats, and ties, and newspapers. until one morning, something rather disturbing happened. [quizzical music playing] [train rattling] [people conversing] [music playing] chaps taken my place. [music playing] [whistle blaring] [train honking] hi there. mind the cigar? this is a smoker. you can do as you please. i just thought i'd ask. a matter of form really. form? well, seeing i'm the new boy. pretty. quite a popsy, don't you think? i find it rather early in the morning for conversation. don't you? good god. you remind me of my old company commander in the coldstream guards. if a new subaltern so much as dared to say good morning to him, he'd bark back with seven in rapid fire. good morning. good morning. good morning. good morning. good morning. good morning. good morning. and that's thrice for a week. very funny. good chap, though. worked us into the ground. we don't stay for him. william perkins (voiceover): what's the matter with you? letting a perfect stranger rattle-- ruin my day. [music playing] he better not prove to be a regular. morning. morning. i see he is here again. afraid so. third day running. any idea who he is? not the foggiest. oh, my god. uh. william perkins (voiceover): not after all these years. not galloping foxley. you beat me to it this morning. hmm? you're sitting in my place. no, these last mornings, you have been sitting in mine. oh, you should have told me. i'd have swapped. i said i was the new boy. william perkins (voiceover): no. [music playing] i was. i was the new boy. glad we motored down for you? [people conversing] yes. mm. you seem settled in. yes. best days of your life are just beginning, you'll see. a jolly fine school. now, where's the hosp-- i say, don't they teach your better manners than that. it seems to me an apology is in order. i'm so sorry. i don't like your tone, sir. really? you strike me as being impudent and ill-mannered. i can only hope that you're the exception here. i shouldn't wish any son of mine to pick up such habits. [footsteps] ah, mr perkins. i see you've already met our head of house, bruce foxley. a very fine sportsman. all-rounder-- football, cricket. his manners leave something to be desired. schoolmaster: really? i dare say it's the excitement of being back, eh bruce? exactly, sir. schoolmaster: why didn't you go and sort out the junior duty roster. take your pick of the new chaps. with pleasure, sir. schoolmaster: well, perkins, i expect you feel very much the new boy. don't worry, you'll soon make your mark. just what i've been telling him. schoolmaster: report [inaudible].. there's a good chap. chin up, tickety boo. bye, dad. bye, william. now, keep your pecker up, mm. mm hmm. write soon. schoolmaster: naturally, he feels he's walking into the lion's den-- all the new men do. but it soon passes off. new boy, get that hat off. bruce foxley: perkins. yes? bruce foxley: you're mine, boy. am i? my personal servant, and valet, bed-maker, dogsbody, washer-upper, boot-cleaner-- you're my slave, perkins. [bell ringing] slaves, rise and shine. slaves, rise and shine. slaves, rise and shine. slaves, rise and shine. bruce foxley (voiceover): right perkins, recite your duties. william perkins (voiceover): when the bell rings, i get up, dust the desk, clean his shoes, put out his clothes, polish the fender, clean the grate. [door opens] good morning, foxley. what do you think you're doing? william perkins: cleaning the grate. you're behind schedule. william perkins: no, you said-- bruce foxley: shut up, slave. [bell ringing] i'm breathing. [inhaling and exhaling] you had better get down to the bogs. bogs? the lavatories. the water closets. the latrines. le petit quan. the place is of easement, boy. do i clean them? bruce foxley: if necessary. then you warm the seat for me. and if it's not warm enough, then i warm yours. [train rumbling] bruce foxley: something wrong? hmm? you're staring. i'm sorry. bruce foxley: do you imagine we've met before or something? i'm sorry william perkins (voiceover): i know very well we've met before. oh, yes. oh, yes, foxley. i could expose you for the perfect swine you were. you don't recognize me, do yo, eh? hmm? and the stache, march of years. but i recognize you, all right. [pounding] oh, yes. no, i've decided, perkins, it's going to be with the dressing gown off. please! off. hurry up, come on. now, touch your toes. tighter, much tighter than that. now, what are you? i-- i'm a lazy little boy. who can't light a fire, who can't polish a button without smudging the uniform. what else are you? i don't know. i don't like your tone, sir. you strike me as impudent and ill-mannered. and your father is very particular about manners, isn't he? well? well? it's a question requiring the answer. yes, boy? yes? yes. stay still. blubber, boy, and you'll get an extra stroke. this is why i'm known as galloping foxley. it's because i always beat at the gallop. [stomping] [whimpering] [stomping] [music playing] william perkins: ah! [crying] [coughing] hey, you. psst. hey. psst. hey. perkins' over there. how many did he get? perkins? yeah. oh, he got five. five? with his dressing gown off, two. it was going to be four, but blubbered. you always blubber with foxley because of the runner. he goes down the basement passage-- that leaves time for you to feel pain, you see. at first, you don't feel anything. just a sort of blunt thud. a sort of numbing. but after a few seconds, about 10, that's the time it takes galloping foxley to go down the basement passage, then it starts like a red-hot poker, by which time, he's galloping back. [imitating beating] poor perkins. perkins. perkins. what? show us damage. go on. no. come on, we're on your side. no, please. [interposing voices] we're ever so sorry, let's see the marks. oh, all right. hmm, rather far apart. not up to foxley's usual standard. two are close. [inaudible] is actually touching. that low one's a rotten shot, but it's bled. golly, foxley's really got it in for you, perkins. [footsteps] what's the idea? back to bed, all of you. so perkins' showing off, is he? is that it? another peep out of any of you, and you'll get what perkins got. [smack] [music playing] william perkins (voiceover): all coming back. small eyes, corrugated forehead, the wavy, oily hair. the glove-- the white glove. catch. butterfingers. better. you are improving, perkins. thank you, foxley. it took me all day. at first glance that is, but we'll see what my patent dust detector can do. shall we? good. [sighs] ah, so you're a lazy little bounder after all, aren't you? i thought i dusted it all. you thought? well, we'll meet later on, won't we? after prayers, in the changing room. it was under the chair. as my slave, you clean my study. and clean means clean. yes, foxley. and you've forgotten the wild iris's for my desk. there wasn't time. there is now. but preps at four. bruce foxley: you'll have to hurry. [rainfall] the ponds only 2 and 1/2 miles across the fields. [thunder] [somber music playing] [laughter] a drowned rat. [laughter] don't come in. only four? hopeless. william perkins: i couldn't reach. that's another stroke. go on, get your coat off. we need you to make more toast. what's your slave like, julian? shaping up. i pictured that in perkins. idle, insolent, incompetent-- i have to beat him almost daily. i'm developing muscles where i didn't even know i had them. [chuckles] you expect me to eat this? it's hardly done, this side. but you don't like it burnt. useless. [music playing] bruce foxley (voiceover): you've earned yourself another strike, perkins. william perkins (voiceover): and to think i used to write home and say i was all right, except i got a cold because i was caught in the rain-- never a word about how he beat me. you beat me. you seven minutes to canner street. seven minutes to expose you, foxley. it's-- it's a thought. yes, why not? why not? [clearing throat] william perkins: i wonder if i might have your attention just for a few moments. i know it's not customary for us to speak very much on this daily journey. and i hope you'll forgive me. but this gentleman's presence has prompted some old memories of my school days. man 1: really? man 2: that's extraordinary. william perkins: mm. yes, it was a long time ago now of course, but i remember. yes, i remember it very well. you see, i suffered. i suffered terribly at his hands. i was his slave, and i could never do anything right because he was a total sadist-- what in the old days we would have called a bounder. he made my life a misery for a year. i almost committed suicide because of him. he hasn't recognized me, but i've recognized him. oh, yes. he was-- he was head of my house at public school, and he wielded absolute power over the new men, as we small boys were called. and as we know, absolute power corrupts absolutely. this man was a perfect hitler to me. any service not performed to his satisfaction was a beatable offense, and how he loved to exercise that privilege. still carries the cane, do you? that's-- that's just like the one he used to beat me with so scientifically. his peculiar talent was torture, mental and physical. [train honking] gentleman, galloping foxley. well, foxley, do you recognize me now? hmm? william perkins? saint wilfred's? i'm very glad to meet you. but i'm fortescue. jocelyn fortescue. eton, 1928.

natural causes. you'll know what i mean if you're ever fool enough now hand me one of those aspirators over there. one of these? yeah. you know, the human body is one big cesspool. food flows in, shit flows out, and blood flows all around. and it's got to be drained. ezra: yes, sir. bobby: oh... bobby: oh! ugh. it's only blood. give me another one of these. this tub of lard will start to stink in a couple of days. that's why we've got to embalm him. pass me that tube over there. pass me that tube over there. cleanliness is next to godliness. don't you know don't you know hold this. get in there. bobby: aren't you supposed to or something?

what was that for? you think water grows on trees? lord almighty, you got shit for brains. now get the molasses out and clean this stiff up. we don't have any more disinfectant. then take this. you're about as stupid as your mama, boy. my heart bleeds for you, mr. johnson. thank you, mr. thorntonberry. i feel as though i lost one of my own. that was a very nice service. ezra: there you are, ma'am. i told you to stop messing with that damn organ! bobby, close that damn coffin. i can smell mrs. johnson already. yes, sir. you wanted to see me, uncle ezra? no, but i have no choice. go measure the jeffries body so i can order his casket. yes, sir. ""oak."" 5 foot 6. we're all very thankful for your help, these last 2 days have been rather trying. yes, i can imagine. you and your family have my condolences, mr. jeffries, but don't worry. i've taken care of everything. here we are... the perfect vessel to send your son on his way to the realm of glory. is there something wrong? this casket is made of pine. well, that's right. the highest quality of pine from but i specifically asked for oak. oak? that's right. but i've already paid- i want nothing but the best for my son, bobby! yes, uncle ezra? you stupid half-wit! he ordered oak, not pine! who? mr. jeffries? you know what this is gonna cost me? you got any idea? i'm gonna have to pay for that damn pine coffin. but uncle, i told you oak. don't you lie to me, boy. i'm not lying, uncle. i swear to god i- don't you dare use the lord's name in vain. now you're gonna have to be punished... severely. now, uncle, please- aah! oh! aah! get up! oh, help me! get up, i said! you got work to do. my legs! to hell with your legs. get up, you no-good, lying dog. my legs. help me. my legs. help me. your nephew has suffered a severe spinal injury, mr. thorntonberry. he'll never walk again. how on earth did that happen? his own carelessness, i'm afraid. he fell down the stairs. if i've told him once, i told him 1,000 times, no running inside. he's a spirited boy, you know-an athlete. not anymore. damn that boy. he'll put me in the poorhouse yet. bobby: uncle ezra? what you want, boy? ezra! don't you ezra me! don't you ezra me! where are my air jordans? i sold them. you sold them? got a pretty good price for them, too. how could you sell my shoes? don't you raise your voice at me, boy! look at you. you're nothing but a helpless cripple. what are you gonna do with shoes? all you're gonna do is cost me money. you're nothing but a goddamn burden! well, you should have thought about that before you hit me with that crowbar! i ought to call the sheriff. that's what i'm going to do. the sheriff, huh? and where you going to go next? the state hospital, that's where, right there with all the rest those shoes were going to go to waste just like that damn pine... coffin you ordered. phew. whew. ahh. hello, bobby. uh, hi, uncle. what are you doing with my ball? oh! oh! waste not, want not. that's what i always say. here we are, in silent repose, just the way i want you. damn. you're a nuisance even when you're dead. i'm sure as hell not gonna order another coffin. hmm. uh... boy ain't as dumb as i thought he was. damn fluoride. strange how he should happen to fall down the stairs again, isn't it, mr. thorntonberry? well, perhaps it's for the best. the boy was young and full of vigor. he would've made a miserable cripple. such a short coffin for a boy so tall. for a boy so tall. what you want, clyde? bye, mr. thorntonberry. where the hell you think you're going? you got work to do. i ain't doing nothin'. i'm quittin'. look, i know that nice young man didn't die in no accident. i know it. i can't prove it, but i know what i know. but i know what i know. then good riddance, you no-account organ freak. i don't need you! i don't need anybody! get the hell out of here and stay out, you pervert! oh, unh... oh, unh... who could that be at this ungodly hour? messing with me this time of night. don't know what's going on around here. ezra: who's there? ezra: who's there? what do you want, you goddamn hooligans? damn people are always messing with me. don't understand what's going on around here. they're always talking and saying things... now, who the hell left this on? now, who the hell left this on? damn fools. you turning my lights on, clyde, wherever you are? think you can come crawling to beg for your job back? well, then you can go to hell. you trying to scare me, clyde? is that it? well, i got news for you. i don't scare easy. takes a lot more than you got, aah!aah! unh... my legs. oh, my god. i can't... i can't feel my legs. oh, my god. it can't be! oh, my god. ahh! ah! ah! god, no, no, no. god, no, no, no. ah! like it says in the bible, blood is thicker than water. this can't be happening. somebody... somebody help me! no! no! no! well, looks like old ezra learned raising a teen is no walk in the graveyard. now he's going to need one of his cheap coffins for himself. that's what he gets for having a name like ezra. as for poor bobby, he got a pretty nasty case of athlete's foot, i mean, i've heard of footloose, but yikes! oh, well! i guess the next best thing to making a goal is becoming a ghoul. right, kiddies?"

(alarm sounding) doll: it's 6:00 a.m. rise and shine, barney, dear. ? get up, get up, you sleepyhead ? ? get up, get up... ? too loud, honey. and too late. for most of us, our heart's desire seems to lie behind a bolted door. but what if the lives we find so familiar were someone else's dream come true? perhaps, for all of us, somewhere is a hidden door into the twilight zone. oh, shut up. isn't this the time of day when people are shot? morning. rise and shine. still dead, huh? well, i tried. i ought to get a lawyer. morning, honey. if it isn't the creature who lives in the basement. cleaning it up, i hope. katie, my girl, my girl, what do you think? it's alive. big deal. no, it's not. barney, i may have been born but i can tell a live plant that one's alive. technically it's not, because i made it. rather than watering things all day, you just wind it up like this. oh, great. another practical invention from the mind of barney schlesinger. too bad you don't apply that much effort to your job. it only took me about five nights. it took god six days. but he made the original. you just made a copy, barney. i guess that means you don't want this up here? shouldn't you be getting i'll take that as a no. nobody needs copies, barney. tell that to xerox. (train whistle blows) it was supposed to be a gift. i thought she'd like it. why should katie like it? she can't kill it. come on, face it, barn. you got a blue-sky mind. marconi could have learned things from you. your timing just isn't right. you're a little, i don't know... out of step. i thought that mouse missile thing had real possibilities. it was deadly. yeah. except the explosion left little mouse parts all over the place. people prefer their nice, neat traps, i guess. you getting enough sleep? mm-hmm. four solid hours a night. you see, barn, that's no good. you can't get anywhere by working yourself to death. having those dreams again? every night for the past week. what was it this time-- a garden party? or just examining your collection of fine...? just waking up, that's all. who's waking up-- you or the guy in the dream? me. him. the both of us. milt, ever since i was a kid, i've felt i was living in two worlds at the same time. two worlds that are kind of side by side but very different, you know? this is getting confusing. so, enjoy the fantasy. at least you got that much. yeah, but it's happening every night lately, and i'm just worried. do you think maybe i'm losing my mind? you? come on, barn. nice day, mr. schlesinger. aren't they all, steve? may i ask you a question, sir? a little inside information? trimboline splits at 50. i want you to stick with us. thank you. (thunder crashing) sorry i'm late. i suppose you're expecting dinner? oh, sure. dinner. no. let's talk first, shall we? you promised you wouldn't disturb my workshop. no, you promised me you'd clean it up. barney, this stuff has been down here look at it. look at us. it's just wrong. all right. you're right, honey. i'll just... i'll clean this stuff up. i know we can start over fresh and you can stop working on these stupid inventions. they're not stupid. even if they were, i don't think i could stop. my mind just works that way. then let your mind work on this: if you want to sleep in my bed, you'll clean this up tonight. some choice. (alarm sounds) doll: it's 8:00, barney. dear. ? blue moon, you left me standing alone... ? would you just shut up? hmm. good old mouse missile. (muffled laughter) i must be going crazy. (explosion) woman: barney, your partner wants to make coming. i'll be right up. hurry. (chamber music playing) uh... here i am. woman: there you are. we thought you disappeared. well, we made it. you're on the front page of the business section. barney schlesinger, president of trimboline enterprises... and his partner, milton baumsey... have announced the development of trimboline three. then there's boring history about barney and his earlier wonder substances before we get to the heart of the matter. ""trimboline three is a super fuel ""which allows the automobile ""as great as 60 miles per hour, ""with a fuel efficiency of 100 miles per gallon. ""schlesinger furtherclaims ""that trimboline-powered automobiles will replace the horse in a few years."" i get the impression, once again, they are skeptical. and, once again, they will learn barney schlesinger is a manahead well, let's hope so. a toast. well... to my best friend and partner, whose inventions have made the world and all of us a little richer. ladies: hear! hear! all right. would you care to dance, old friend? yeah. sure. sometimes i wish i'd been born a man. dancing always seems to be such fun. don't be silly. we weren't built for it. men's legs are so much stronger. we have other talents. isn't it high time you made an honest man of the lovely mr. schlesinger? propose to barney? well, i must admit the thought has crossed my mind. he's so successful and intelligent. he's such a cute dancer. but, you know, when he's with me, i'm never really sure he's with me. you know what i mean? another woman? you know how men are. thank you for a lovely evening, barney, in spite of the weather. the carriages are here, ladies. mr. baumsey. hurry along, milt. you all right, friend? you seem distant tonight. a little tired, maybe. those dreams again? dreams? your dreams-- where you live in the world next door. a world where you are freed from these all this fame and acclaim. i don't know what you find so it must seem pretty ridiculous, i guess. from the details you've told me, it sounds... fascinating in a horrible sort of way. barney, i've been meaning to ask-- am i in those dreams? oh, yes. yes, you are. am i still your partner? milt, i can honestly say that, in those dreams, you're still my best friend. then i'm happy in either world. stay here, barney. we need you as you are. will that be all for today, uh... yeah. great, fine. thank you. too bad you have to wake up. (knocking) (pounding) i'm sorry to disturb you on a night like this, but my carriage broke down and my horse ran off. katie? have we met? no, no. i don't believe so. but you know my name. you look like a katie. oh. please, go ahead and sit down while i find the butler. uh... jeeves? morgan! henry! coming, sir. (laughter) i've driven by this house every day and night for the past three years. really? i always wondered who lived here. it never occurred to me to suspect it would be the famous barney schlesinger. i didn't realize i was that famous. would it be impertinent if i asked you a question? no. i can't see how? where do you get your ideas for those fabulous inventions? henry: excuse me, the blacksmith has repaired madam's carriage. thank you, henry. madam's garment has been cleaned and awaits her in the guest room. well, i should get dressed. but... katie: oh, barney. i don't know what to say. i'd just about given up. almost finished, hon. i don't mind your spending time here making things if you'd just straighten up. (mouths:) go. (mouths:) bye. good luck, barney. i can't thank you enough for your kindness. no, no. my pleasure. a little going-away gift from me to you. oh, how wonderful. where on earth did you find an orchid at this time of year? no, it's mechanical. see? i made it. you made it? i'm holding a barney schlesinger original. yes. thank you so much. i'll treasure it. mr. schlesinger? just call me barney please. would you think me forward if i called on you one evening soon? katie, my girl. you can find me here every night from now on. um... henry?"
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0," feels heavy. baby's first tricorder? not exactly. hmm... thank you. l'm sure she'll love it. what is it? a pleenok. vulcans use them to train their infants in primary logic. never too early to train those synapses, eh, tuvok? here, let me see that. l love a good puzzle. this one's from mr. kim. starfleet diapers. standard issue. at least we'll know who to call if there's a containment breach. now that your borg implants have been removed, you might think about having children of your own one day. one day. l have been considering some less radical changes in my personal life. such as? l realize l don't have a rank, but l would like to request a uniform. consider it done. the doctor tells me you don't need to regenerate anymore. l can arrange some quarters for you, unless you enjoy curling up in the cargo bay. a bed would be more comfortable. since l arrived on voyager, your guidance has been invaluable. thank you, captain. all l did was chart the course. you were the one who made the journey. seven. lt's traditional for everyone to share their best wishes for the baby. l thought you might like to start. to the newest member of our crew... may all her desires be fulfilled except for one... so she'll always have something to strive for. -oh, very good. -well said. -hear, hear. -hear, hear. and may she inherit a sense of logic from her mother. l'll drink to that. that was strange. care to explain? l wish l could. long-range sensors picked up an energy discharge, but now it's gone. there. there's another one. they're occurring approximately 5.9 light-years ahead. -source? -we're too far to get a clear reading. bridge to seven of nine. go ahead. report to the astrometrics lab. acknowledged. computer, end program. l wasn't able to find the cause of the discharges, but the region ahead contains unusual amounts of subspace radiation and metallic debris. vessels? not within range, but l'll have more data once we move closer. l see no reason to alter course. keep an eye on your sensors. yes, captain. now... on to more pressing matters. does b'elanna suspect anything? not a clue. good. mess hall, 1400 hours. be on time; l don't want to spoil the surprise. l expect both of you to show up. l'll be busy here. what's wrong, seven? no baby showers in the collective? l'm sure you can spare a few minutes. lf it's any consolation, l share your discomfort with social gatherings. they seem to occur with alarming frequency. mr. neelix would argue that they improve morale. l have been looking for ways to improve my social skills. perhaps l'll attend. well, it certainly is, uh... efficient. no clutter. plenty of room to move around. eh, but it's a little impersonal. don't you think? explain. well, these are your quarters, seven. they should reflect your individuality. how about a table and a couple of chairs? give yourself a place to work... entertain guests. uh, try to add a little color. uh, uh, photographs, uh, artwork, knickknacks. knickknacks? little things, like the wood carvings in ensign kim's quarters. l've never been to ensign kim's quarters. but l suppose l could replicate some items and disperse them throughout the room. that's a start. some people like to display pictures of family and friends. there's a photograph of my parents in the ship's database. l'll make a copy and place it in a frame. good, good. a multispectral starchart might enhance this bulkhead. or a painting. a painting of a starchart. l-l was thinking of something more abstract, more, uh, artistic. uh, drapes. nothing livens up a room like good window dressing. not to mention the added privacy. privacy? we're in space. well, you never know when we'll be docking at a crowded spaceport. but we'll have to make sure that they match the carpet. l'm thinking of a talaxian mosaic, uh, tulaberry blue stripes with an orange inlay... l appreciate your aesthetic insights, but l believe l can proceed on my own. enter. am l interrupting? please come in. love what you've done with the place. we're in the process of decorating. maybe this will help. consider it a housewarming gift. lt's beautiful. what is it? a dreamcatcher. according to native american mythology, it wards off nightmares. l'm impressed. l've familiarized myself with your culture. now that you'll be sleeping instead of regenerating, l thought it might come in handy. l'm sure it will. thank you. l'll let you two find a place to hang that. but it would look perfect right above the bed. pleasant dreams. lt was thoughtful of you to stop by. on move-in day? l wouldn't miss it. l suppose this makes you my inaugural guest. l'd be a negligent host if l didn't offer you a beverage. tea? that might be difficult. no replicator. another flaw in the decor. l'll requisition one for you first thing tomorrow. l'd appreciate that, commander. chakotay. we're off-duty. we can drop the formalities. yes, sir. l enjoyed your toast today. you've come a long way. l hope to see more. you will. good night. chakotay. as you might know, l've taken an interest in culinary science. l'm preparing a meal tomorrow night, and l thought perhaps you could attend... to evaluate my work. l'd be happy to. 1900 hours? l'll bring the wine... and the furniture. then you accept? lt's a date. rock-a-bye baby, in the space dock when the core blows, the shuttle will rock when the hull breaks, the shuttle will fall and down will come baby, shuttle and all... are you trying to soothe the infant or traumatize her? the lyrics are rather grim, but it's the melody they respond to. l recorded 29 in all, including a couple of klingon lullabies. my favorite is ''quong vaj ocht. '' ''sleep, little warrior.'' l could tell by the look on their faces that my gift made quite an impression. no doubt. l wish you'd been there. lt was a lovely shower. tom and b'elanna were disappointed that you didn't attend. l was occupied. are you experiencing any shoulder pain? yes. hmm. your biradial clamp is out of alignment by .3 microns. l'm afraid it'll have to be repaired. can't you simply extract the component? not if you want to keep using that arm. l know it's an inconvenience, but until we can find a way to remove your cybernetic systems, they'll have to be maintained. lt's a minor procedure. we might as well take care of it now. l prefer to wait. we'll be done in an hour. l have research to complete. oh. l suppose we can put it off until next week's physical. l also noticed that your electrolyte levels are down by 12 percent. have you missed any regeneration cycles? last night. don't tell me. more... research? this must be some project. mind if l ask what you're working on? lt's complicated. how do you mean? my personal life is none of your concern. l wasn't aware you had a personal life. report? lt was an energy discharge, 200,000 kilometers starboard. lt produced a level-9 shock wave. some kind of weapon? possibly. another one, five million kilometers to port. a shock wave is approaching. full power to the shields. our warp field's destabilizing. l'm detecting another. distance: 50,000 kilometers. turn our bow into the wave front. lt'll minimize the damage. sorry, captain, there wasn't enough time. we've lost warp drive. l'm reading another. distance: 26 million kilometers. too far to pose a threat. lf they are weapons, they don't seem to be directed at us. or whoever's firing them is a lousy shot. astrometric sensors recorded the explosions. l believe it's a long-range subspace warhead. the debris in this region suggests that dozens have been fired in the last several weeks. the warhead destroyed something. what was it? lt appeared to be an unmanned probe. this is all very intriguing, but l'd just as soon get out of here before we cross paths with another one of these things. where do we stand on repairs? subspace radiation from the explosions is making it difficult to create a stable warp field. lieutenant torres estimates 48 hours. can you find a way to detect the warheads before they emerge from subspace? l believe so. the weapons create minor gravimetric distortions as they approach the subspace barrier, but l'll need to recalibrate my sensors to isolate the effect. do it. even a few seconds' warning would help us. yes, captain. your duty shift doesn't begin for two hours. the doctor sent me to relieve you early. he wants you to spend more time regenerating. l see he's enlisted an ally. ''don't kill the messenger.'' lt's sophocles-- oedipus rex. l've been studying earth literature as a part of my academy training. continue these scans of the subspace barrier. look for any gravimetric distortions. run another diagnostic on the injector ports. make sure they're aligned. they're aligned. l checked. check again. come to join the fun? we're trying to cold-start the warp core... for the 15th time. perhaps this will enhance your day. lt's a belated gift for your baby shower. l apologize for my absence. oh. proceed. they're lined with biothermal insulation. your infant's feet will be protected, even if the external temperature drops below minus 40 degrees celsius. well, they're certainly unique. thank you. you're welcome. l wish to ask you a personal question. shoot. you have an appealing coiffure. what is your grooming regimen? you're asking me what l do with my hair? yes. oh, well, nothing too elaborate. sonic shower... a little engine grease. thinking about a new look? perhaps. l'll keep you apprised if you'd like. please do. was that seven of nine? there must be an alien intruder on board. computer, make the following modifications to holodeck file: seven of nine alpha-3, personal quarters. modifications complete. begin program. you look perfect. give me a hand with this? l'm surprised your starfleet training didn't include cork extraction. l must have been sick that day. looks like wine's off the menu. unless you brought a phaser. never on the first date. assist me. slice these vegetables transversally in five-millimeter increments. aye, aye. that smells delicious. our appetizer is braised leeks. primary course: rack of lamb with wild rice. no dessert? dessert will be a surprise. l can't wait. does this contain enough sodium chloride for your taste? could use another .6 milligrams, but you're the chef. l concur. more salt. liszt? chopin. l've discovered that classical music has intriguing mathematical properties. do you play an instrument? the doctor's been giving me piano lessons. l'd love to hear you play. l require more practice. your technique is flawed. sorry. l'm a replicator man. use your left hand to guide the food. observe closely. pay attention to the vegetable. you're beautiful when you're chopping. l don't mean to sound like an old holonovel, but you've got a wonderful smile. lt wasn't a smile; it was a smirk. oh, no, it was a smile. l could check the internal sensors if you'd like. remain still. you have an intriguing facial structure. l'll take that as a compliment. l require more practice. you're doing just fine. what's wrong? nothing. l wasn't aware you had a personal life. chakotay to seven of nine. chakotay to seven. respond. go ahead. report to astrometrics. we've found something. yes, commander. good morning. good morning. you found something. at first we thought it was another one of the probes, then lcheb picked up an automated transmission. lt's a warning beacon. you have entered subspace munitions range 434. evacuate immediately. apparently, this entire region is an alien testing ground. we've been sending out emergency hails, but so far, no response. whoever's conducting these tests could be dozens of light-years away. any progress detecting their warheads? not yet. you seem a little distracted. l'm fine. lt's not like you to be late for a duty shift. rough night? not at all. l'll be on the bridge if you find anything. ''better late than never.'' titus livius, a history of rome. you're relieved. get some rest. bravo. you approve? approve? l'm amazed. l was expecting ''chopsticks.'' l had no idea you were so good. the doctor's an efficient instructor. lt won't be long before you're giving a recital for the entire crew. the doctor did suggest that l accompany him during his next operatic performance. your turn. mmm... unfortunately, l don't play. but l'd love to hear you again. and this... is one of my favorites. you want me to stop? no. l want you to play. l don't understand. look. your technique is flawless, but try to put a little more heart into the piece. more of yourself. that's all right. keep going. tell me what you're feeling. my tempo is erratic. not what you're thinking. what you're feeling. your emotions. frustration, anxiety. stop thinking about the notes. just play. l can't. yes, you can. don't you see what's happening? the metronome is holding you back. lt gives you a sense of order, but it also cuts you off from your feelings. remember when you first came aboard? the thought of disconnecting from the hive mind terrified you. this is no different. lt doesn't have to be perfect. 800,000 kilometers off the starboard bow. bridge to seven of nine. go ahead, commander. we need those sensor calibrations. l'll need a moment to return to my station. that would be a good idea. hull fracture, deck 12. seven of nine, report. stand by, captain. lieutenant paris, isolate subspace band omicron theta. acknowledged. direct your sensors to coordinates 178 mark 26. nothing there. correction: 178 mark 36. l can see them. two warheads are about to emerge. adjusting course. full power to the forward shields. lmpact in five... four... three... two... shields are holding. why wasn't seven at her post? good question. maybe you should ask her. lt was your responsibility to locate those warheads. l succeeded. not before we took heavy damage. you told chakotay you'd have those sensor calibrations hours ago. the work took longer than l anticipated. lt might've gone faster if you'd stayed at your post, as you were ordered to do. l didn't realize l was confined to the astrometrics lab. you were on duty. this isn't the first time you've left your station over the past few days. holodeck 2? you've logged a lot of time in there. mind if l ask why? well, it must be something important, seven. 49 hours in six days? l was running a simulation. of what? a new gravimetric array l've been developing. l wanted to perfect the design before l brought it to you. l appreciate your efforts to improve our systems, but l can't have you dividing your time right now. when the ship's on alert, l expect you to perform your duties. lf you need to leave your post, inform commander chakotay. understood? yes, captain. l apologize for my lapse in judgment. we all make mistakes, seven. l've even been known to make a few myself. lt sounds intriguing. your new gravimetric array. when this crisis is over, l'd be happy to take a look. maybe l can lend a hand. l've analyzed the sensor data from that last barrage. l've refined your detection method. we'll be able to see the weapons 10.3 seconds earlier. the captain will be pleased. have l offended you? no. you've done nothing wrong. l was negligent in my duties. as a result, voyager was nearly destroyed. l was hoping you could provide a quotation to help alleviate my guilt. l-l can't think of one, but l'd be happy to search the database. that won't be necessary. stay here until l return. where are you going? to correct an error. computer, activate chakotay simulation. come in. l hope you're not allergic. antarian moon blossoms. extremely rare. l had to smuggle them out of airponics. don't tell neelix. l thought l'd cook for you tonight. how does roasted chicken sound? l slaved over the replicator for hours. not hungry? l called you here to thank you. for what? the past few days have been memorable. to say the least. you're ending this. ln a manner of speaking, yes. why? our relationship is interfering with my responsibilities on voyager. l could speak to the captain, have her cut back on your duty shifts. seven, the past few days have been more than memorable. they've been an important step forward for both of us. don't throw that away. l'm sorry, commander. you're making a mistake. no, l'm trying to correct one. ask yourself why you want to end this. ls it out of a sense of duty... or something else? every time you move closer to your emotions, you back away. like hiding behind that metronome. your analogy is flawed. ls it? l think you're afraid that embracing your humanity will make you weak, less than perfect. but think about what you stand to gain. lt's irrelevant. no, it's not. real intimacy with another person-- nothing's more relevant. l must return to my station. stay here with me. this ship needs me. so do l. l can't function this way! you're not a drone anymore, you're human! stop! seven! what's wrong? sick bay... medical emergency. seven? computer, locate seven of nine. seven of nine is in holodeck 2. what happened? we were having an argument, and she just collapsed. her cortical node is shutting down. she's going into neural shock. and what happened to her facial implants? l thought you removed all her cybernetic systems. computer, end program. commander? lf you're looking for your other holographic friend, he's off-line at the moment. your cortical node began to shut down. fortunately, l managed to stabilize it before there was any permanent damage. lt was functioning properly when you examined me two days ago. l'm going to run a diagnostic on your entire cortical array. but it might help if l knew what you were doing, before you collapsed. did you suffer a physical injury of some kind? no. were you exposed to any unusual radiation? no. what exactly were you doing in there? research. that simulation of commander chakotay mentioned that the two of you were having an argument. was that part of your research? l couldn't help but notice that you'd created some quarters for yourself. a new dress... dinner for two. l trust you'll respect doctor-patient confidentiality. of course. l've been conducting simulations to explore different aspects of my humanity. such as? social activities, friendships with the crew... intimate relations. l take it our first officer is your ''romantic interest''? commander chakotay seemed like an appropriate choice. he has many admirable qualities. so he does. what prompted all this? unimatrix zero. l've been trying to re-create some of the experiences l had there. ever since it was destroyed, my life has... seemed incomplete. l wanted to feel those emotions again. well... this is encouraging. you might be ready to start forming deeper relationships. l'm proud of you, seven. your pride is misplaced. l intend to delete the programs. why? l can no longer perform my duties efficiently. my personal life has become a distraction. lt's supposed to be a distraction. you simply have to find the right balance between work and recreation. lnform me when you finish the diagnostic. seven. for what it's worth, you have excellent taste. your quarters... they suited you. antimatter flow: stable. lnjector ports: aligned. that should do it. torres to the bridge. looks like we've got warp drive back. well done. tom. with pleasure. l'm detecting another subspace warhead. range? 12 million kilometers. closing from astern. red alert. where's the target probe? lt's on a totally different trajectory. when we engaged the engines, the warhead must have diverted from its target and locked on to our warp signature. evasive maneuvers. lt's matching our course. eight million kilometers. can you get a weapons lock? affirmative. photon torpedoes. full spread. our torpedoes have been neutralized. five million kilometers. bridge to seven of nine. here, captain. can you get me anything on the warhead's internal circuitry? stand by. l have it. what can you tell me about the detonator? the weapon is armed with proximity resonance circuitry. what's the activation frequency? 4.84 gigahertz. l may be able to disarm it with an antiresonance pulse. do it. two million kilometers. lnitiating the pulse. seven, status? the warhead's rotating its activation frequency. lt's still armed. one million kilometers. can you compensate? negative. captain, l believe l can disarm the warhead. how? by extracting the detonator with our transporter. at this velocity? the device is too small. you'd never get a lock. l can use the submicron imager to focus our targeting scanners. please, give me transporter control. 800,000. all right, seven. lt's up to you. l have a lock. energizing. the detonator's protected by tritanium shielding. l can penetrate it, but not at this distance. we'll have to wait until it's closer. 500,000. status? not yet, captain. four... three... two... brace for impact! doctor. you've come to deliver unpleasant news. ls it that obvious? l've completed my diagnostic. what you experienced was no malfunction. your cortical node was designed to shut down your higher brain functions when you achieve a certain level of emotional stimulation. clarify. lt appears to be a fail-safe mechanism... to deactivate drones who start to regain their emotions. knowing the borg, it makes perfect sense. finding one's heart is the surest road to individuality. but l'm no longer linked to the hive mind. the technology's built into your node. lt simply remained dormant... until now. can you repair me? possibly. l've been thinking about a way to reconfigure the micro-circuitry. l won't lie to you, seven. lt would entail multiple surgeries, and the recovery might be difficult. but l believe we could eventually succeed. l'll prepare the surgical bay. we can begin tomorrow morning. no. without the procedure, you won't be able to continue your simulations. l've experienced enough humanity for the time being. they were only holographic fantasies, doctor. an inefficient use of my time. you don't really believe that. the fail-safe device will ensure that l'm no longer distracted. that's the borg talking... not you. as your physician... as your friend, l'm asking you to let me proceed. l need to regenerate. seven... good night, doctor. where's the fire? fire? you seem to be in a hurry. l have to finish my report on the subspace warheads. the ship's out of danger, thanks to you. you've earned a break. why don't you join me in the mess hall? neelix is going to give a cooking lesson: ''talaxian tenderloin in ten minutes.'' l'm no longer interested in cooking. then come for the company. b'elanna's going to be there. tuvok even promised to show up. lt'll be fun. l appreciate your offer. another time, perhaps. you know, you should try socializing with the crew a little more. lt might do you some good."
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"- good morning, captain. - good morning, ambassador. - mind if i walk with you for a moment? - no, not at all. is there something i can do for you? i spoke with john last night. he told me why he chose you for this position. well, he wanted someone from earthforce to show the folks back home... no. in addition to that. i'm sorry. i wish he hadn't told you without giving me some advance warning. no, it's all right. i forced the issue. i just wanted you to know that i understand his reasons. you were the correct, logical choice, and i support his decision. i appreciate that, ambassador... ...but since others might not be quite so understanding... ...i would really prefer to keep this between the two... the three of us. i don't think anyone else really needs to know. londo, there you are. i was going to tell you your ship just arrived, but you can see that for yourself. would you like me to tell you what i see, mr. allan? i see... what is that quaint human phrase? ""the end of the line."" the regent is not well. for the next few months, i will be at his side as much as time allows. i will go there and come back here. but when he leaves us... ...the centaurum will turn to me to fill that void. when that day comes, mr. allan... ...i shall not return. barring the occasional state visit... ...i shall never lay eyes on babylon 5 again. i didn't think you'd mind that part. neither did i. - strange, that. - yeah, but you'll be emperor. that's got to be a great feeling, emperor mollari i. the second. there was one before you? yes. long ago. he, too, ended badly. now, come on, you've got your whole life ahead of you. why would you say a thing like that? because i know. my people always know. i don't know why, or how, or where, but i can feel it... ...to the very core of my being, mr. allan. this is where it begins to go badly for all of us. babylon control to transport 11719. you've turned off autopilot. please return control to b5 c & c at once. we're having navigation problems. backing up for another try. negative. do not activate thrusters. we cannot get the pressure doors open in time. systems failure. we've got to pull back or we'll hit the walls. negative. i say again, do not fire thrusters. and so it begins. - there's a hole in your mind. - what do you want? no one here is exactly what he appears. nothing's the same anymore. commander sinclair is being reassigned. why don't you eliminate the entire narn homeworld? i see a great hand reaching out of the stars. president clark signed a decree declaring martial law. these orders have forced us to declare independence. unless your people get off their encounter-suited butts and do something... - you're the one who was. - if you go to z'ha'dum, you will die. why are you here? do you have anything worth living for? i think of my beautiful city in flames. - giants in the playground. - get out of our galaxy! we are here to place president clark under arrest. earth transport marks to babylon control. how much longer do we wait out here? unknown. the captain's out inspecting the damage now. what a mess. lochley to repair team. how long until you can fix this thing? we've got debris all through the main elevator shafts... ... totally gummed up the works. figure 12, 13 hours. come on, you guys are on time and a half as it is. killing me here. tell you what. get it done in 11 hours... ...and i'll pretend i didn't see that extremely non-regulation picture in your locker. the one from your bachelor party. you know, the one with... you've got a deal. thanks. all right, c & c, i'm heading in. i'll come around back. are the emergency airdoors clear? we've got some other official transports coming in the back... ... but we'll keep them out until you're in. this is... finding everything you need? let me guess, now. this must be for the telepaths living in downbelow, right? they don't have anything. they're short on clothes, food, medical supplies. well, tell them to come on up here. i wondered where this got off to. some of them have been through pretty tough psi corps medical experiments... ...so they don't trust doctors. besides, they prefer to be self-sufficient. well, i wouldn't call asking you to steal stuff for them self-sufficient. i am not stealing. this stuff was all earmarked for the lurkers in downbelow. charity cases. we weren't getting paid for it anyway. besides, they didn't ask me to do anything. i came here on my own. you really believe in what they're doing, don't you? they're not here to cause trouble. they're trying to find a place to call home, not just for themselves, but for all telepaths. nobody else wants us. we may as well try and make a place for ourselves. so, yeah, i believe in them. byron has a dream for all telepaths. i want to help make it come true. - franklin, go. - doctor... ... i'd like to come talk to you in an hour if you have time. no problem. i'll see you then. so you need a hand with that? no, i got it. thanks. all right. well, next time you need something, just ask. i found some more supplies. i thought they might help. you've no idea. and these are for you. - what are they? - vitamins. - they should go to the children. - they're too strong for children. then they should go to the sick. which is what you're going to be if you don't slow down and take care of yourself. when was the last time that you slept? really slept. it was three, no... ...four lifetimes ago. i was a coppersmith. and at the end of a long day... ...i lay out under the stars, beside the river... ...and my dearest love cradled my head in her lap. she ran her fingers against my temples and forehead. soft and cool and delicate. and i slept. i slept as i have never slept before or since. i slept full measure enough to sustain me through five eternities. when i awoke, she was gone. and there was a tall tree standing where she had been the night before. a willow. its delicate branches touching my face like tears. it remained there by the river, long after i had gone to dust. if there was a straight answer buried in there somewhere, i sure didn't see it. it was a parable. the willow is deceptively strong. it bends, but it does not break. its roots are deep and can withstand the worst storm. it promises rest and shade... ...and cool breezes to those who would find rest beneath it. you have become my willow. and we have all found shelter in your kindness. thank you. that was probably... ...the most elegant attempt to change the topic i have ever heard. sleep, byron? sleep isn't the issue. we sleep too much. it's the dreaming we don't do enough of. - what is it? - can't you feel it? open your thoughts. take down the walls the mundanes forced us to live inside. open your senses and feel. bloodhound units. yes. he's here. - chief around? - no, he had to hit the head. - what's up? - i don't think i'm supposed to tell you. tell me what? come on, this is me. bester just came on board. said he's here to see the captain. and the bartender says to rené descartes, ""another beer?"" and descartes says, ""i think not,"" and disappears. bester! - you son of a... - what the hell...? - get out of my way! - back off, mister! i said, back off! you don't understand! he... security! escort mr. garibaldi here to the brig and do not cut him loose until i say so. for the record, gentlemen, you are now five seconds away... ...from a court-martial, so make the best of them. my apologies for the interruption, mr. bester. not at all, captain. i'm used to it. now, where were we? you want me to quit medlab? not quit. just delegate some of your responsibilities to your staff... ...to make room for other things. what kind of other things? with the creation of this new alliance, there will be even more interaction... ...between races from different worlds. and some diseases can cross from one species to another. yeah, i know. it worries me. literature on cross-species infection is still growing. there hasn't been opportunity for research in that area. well, now there is. as advisory council for the new alliance... ...we want you to put together the definitive work in this area. your work here on babylon 5 was a good start. you've had access to medical conditions of dozens of races. now we want to send you out to member worlds to do firsthand research. where that is impractical, we will put you in contact with their ambassadors here. it is a condition of membership that medical information be made available to you. obviously, there are certain dangers. many of the other races want to keep their medical histories confidential. but we'd love to have you take on the job, if you're willing. hell, yeah. where do i sign up? he will be a fine addition to our team. very fine. i agree. so why are you troubled? i do not feel as if i am doing enough for the alliance, delenn. be careful, g'kar. when the universe hears you say something like that... ...it tends to answer in the most surprising ways. captain, good. i was just about to call you. i understand you got into a bit of a dustup with mr. garibaldi. that's correct. he burst in on a meeting and attempted... ...to assault my guest. captain, your guest... ...got inside mr. garibaldi's head... ...reprogrammed him, messed up his life. - hell, he almost got both of us killed. - i'm aware of that, sir. the reports do a very good job of putting across his side, and yours. now, would you like to hear my side or continue shouting? if the latter... ...please let me know so i can sit down and get comfortable. go on. despite my objections... ...you gave the telepaths permission to form a colony here. you did not, however, grant them immunity from prosecution. they're wanted on a variety of charges by the psi corps. - also known as ""fascists are us."" - granted. nonetheless, they are a part of the government, and i am accountable to it. bester is here on direct orders from earthgov. now, you and delenn said very specifically... ...the interstellar alliance grants sovereignty to each world... ...to govern its people the way it sees fit. since earthgov is part of the alliance, you have to respect their policies. - how am i doing so far? - annoyingly logical. - thank you. - it wasn't a compliment. i can't ignore him or throw him out until he breaks the rules. whatever past relationship you and garibaldi have with him... ...i have to behave according to what he does on my watch. if i judged everyone according to what was reported to me by others... ...l'd have concluded that you were a traitor to earth... ...during the war and shot you on sight, sir. i give you my word, if he breaks the rules an inch, he's out of here. but until then, i have got to do this my way. i suppose you're right. if i contravene our policies for my own convenience... ...it'll give our enemies something to point to and say we're hypocrites. if i violate my promise to the telepaths, our enemies will latch on to that as well. i'm caught in a web of my own good intentions. well, the road to hell is paved with them, sir. i know. but why does it have to go through this office? he can't have them, captain. i won't allow it. well, at least give me a reason to say no, other than ""i don't want to""... ...l'll stick him on the next transport out. - i gave them my word. - well, that may not be enough. find a way to make it enough. you're not going to make this easy on me, are you, sir? it's not my job. centauri liner to babylon control. we can't wait any longer for you to finish repairs. - we have a schedule to keep. - understood. ambassador mollari will just have to catch the next liner to centauri prime. turning orbital control back to your system. confirmed. setting navigational controls to locate centauri prime main beacon. 4-4-3-6-9. any idea yet what happened to that cruiser? we found trace of a chemical explosive material and a detonator. it looks like the bomb was hooked into the ship's navigational system. it was programmed to explode... ...when the nav system was set for a particular destination. they programmed a series of jumps... ...that would take them to the centauri transit beacon when the explosion hit. - somebody didn't want that liner going home. - whoever it was, they weren't from here. the chemical composition of that explosive was centauri... ...so it was definitely planted there. - well, we were the liner's last stop... ...so if the bomb was programmed to go off... ...when the beacon was set for the return voyage... ...then the target has to be someone getting on board here. - any vips leaving? - just londo. that's what i was afraid of. all right, i will go talk to the ambassador. see if he can narrow down the list of suspects to just... ...a few thousand of the enemies he's made over the years. i'll need copies of all your computer reports. i'll make sure we haven't missed anything. take these. thanks. by the way, captain, just curious... ...how long did you plan to leave garibaldi in the brig? i haven't decided yet. why? well, i can understand why he went fusion like that. that's not the point. this is a matter of discipline and protocol. you just don't walk into somebody's office and start a fight... ...unless invited to do so. this is the most amazing base i've ever been posted to. everybody here's either trying to kill each other... ...or pound each other into a pulp. i don't know what kind of way that is to run a... - something wrong? - well, this status report, it says: ""the system was used to pull someone's classified personnel file."" whose? mine. security access code number 0171359. garibaldi? yeah. where are you going? to pound someone, mr. allan. you win. i just decided if you can't join them, beat them. they're not here. yes, i'd heard you've been spending time with them. compassion is a lovely thing, taken in moderation. tell me you haven't gone over to their side. i thought telepaths were all on the same side. don't play games, lyta. whether you know it or not, these people are dangerous. they're on nobody's side but their own. - tell me where they are. - no. you have the bloodhounds, go find them yourself. anything? wait, wait. nothing. nothing at all. this is a crowded area. even if the blips weren't here... ...you'd still be picking up something. unless... ...you were being jammed. for a moment, i forgot how strong you are. - i won't make that mistake again. - i suggest you leave. now. check the hall. i said get out! i am a duly authorized officer of the law. stand aside or... - or what? - not bad. is that really telekinesis, or are you just pushing the nerve endings... ...making them feel as if they've been slapped? either way, it's taking a lot out of you, lyta. you're sweating. flushed. how many times can you do that, lyta? can you do just one at a time? maybe two? how about three? how about a half dozen of us? i don't know. like you said, i'm new at this. i could even make a mistake. maybe even pop a blood vessel in someone's head by accident... ...by pushing too hard. feel like playing the odds, mr. bester? unnecessary, ms. alexander. things have changed. this time, i have allies in the chain of command around here. we'll be back with several dozen security guards. i doubt you'll be very effective against so many. if your friends are still here, they'll be arrested. if they scatter... ...it'll make our job easier... ...since you can't shield them that way. either way... ...we're taking them back with us. be seeing you, lyta. - i saw what you did. how did you...? - i can't talk about it now, byron. tell your people. get going, fast! spread out all over the station. it's their only chance. i know some places that might work, for a while, anyway. thank you. - what was that for? - for believing. now, come on, we have to go. all right, mr. garibaldi. either we thrash this out once and for all, or one of us is gonna go. i can assure you, it won't be me. you can do your job just as well on mars. now, you have been riding me since the day i got here. - what the hell is your problem? - for starters, i don't know you... ...therefore i don't trust you. - the world's full of people you don't know. - i worry about that all the time. tough. get over it. what else? why were you so chummy with bester? i was stationed at an earthforce base near a mining company several years ago. a rogue telepath was messing with my people. first, cheating them in the casino... ...and later he killed two of them because they found out what he was. we couldn't find him. bester did. and he saved the lives of two of my crew. now, i don't actually like him, and i sure as hell don't trust him... ...but so far, he hasn't done anything unpleasant to me. i'm sure he will. this place brings that out in everyone. but until then, i have an obligation to be courteous. and i have an obligation to shove his face through a bulkhead. your hobbies are your concern, mr. garibaldi. just do it where i can't see it, and do it quietly. thanks. now... now for the big one. why did sheridan pick you to run this place? there's something between you. what is it? is that why you went ransacking through my personnel file? looking for something that i'm holding over the president? blackmail or some covert political agenda? are you really that dead inside that you can't even imagine another reason? all right. all right, obviously, we got off on the wrong foot. maybe it's my fault. i crawled up your butt more than a few times when i got here. maybe it's your fault. yeah, it's definitely more your fault than mine, but... i'm here because sheridan wanted a symbol. somebody who was on the other side. he figured it would bring the folks back home together. he also wanted someone he knew he could trust. someone he didn't have to worry about sandbagging him... ...or stabbing in the back when he wasn't looking. someone who'd argue with him when necessary... ...but would back him when he was right. - that's you? that's me. why? - it can't leave this room. - i am the soul of discretion. a very long time ago, sheridan and i... ...were married, for all of about three months. get out of town. - how many wives has he got? - just three. we met fresh out of officer training school. we hit it off... ...fell crazy in love, got married... ...realized we'd made a terrible mistake, fell crazy out of love, and split up. you see, in a relationship, you gotta take turns being in charge... ...but we both wanted to be in charge all the time. we had arguments that could peel paint off the wall. but it was over a long time ago. he's not carrying a torch for me, i'm not carrying one for him. but the bottom line is he knows he can trust me... ...and i know i can trust him. and that's why i'm here. what's so amusing? you. me. all of this. if i had 100 years, i couldn't have come up with that one. well, that's very true. and maybe that's something you ought to think about, mr. garibaldi. i guess i can go now, right? right? not as long as bester's still here. it's not that i don't trust you... ...but i don't trust you. lochley. go. we have a request from bester... ... for security personnel to help him round up the telepaths. - what do i tell him? - where did it come from? direct from earth dome. well, we can't refuse, then. give him what he needs, but no more. now the fun really starts. help me! help me, please! lyta. byron? you called me? yes. to say goodbye. half my people have been captured. the rest will fall soon. my place is with them. no! we can fight them. violence is not our way. we must aspire to be better than that. they know you were in charge. they'll kill you! it is a distinct possibility... ...but perhaps there is a rough justice in that. it is not your fault, byron. yes, it is! i should've known better by now. i was wrong to bring them here... ...wrong to trust in others. and perhaps i was most wrong of all... ...to hold out the possibility of hope to them, to myself... ...and to you. please, don't. you could stay with me. i could hide you. i believe you could. i believe you would protect me... ...until the stars themselves went cold and dead. but my people need me, and i must go to them. you have been kind to us. carry out the legacy to others out there like us, and for me, that will be enough. goodbye, lyta. and we finally got the cargo lifts operating at 100 percent capacity. ms. connelly expects the backlog should be cleared in a couple of hours. good. good. so... ...how goes the witch hunt? bester's people have almost all the rogue telepaths in custody. we figure there's maybe a half dozen left, plus the leader. they should have them in hand by the end of the day. any response from earth on delaying turning over the prisoners to bester? negative. and i wouldn't expect one until after they've already left. have bester's people broken any station regs? roughed anybody up? arrested the wrong people? no. they've kept their noses so clean you could eat off them. not an image i wanted this early in the morning, but thank you. any other reports? all right, dismissed. captain? one thing. delenn asked if i'd be willing to work with her on putting together... ...a medical catalog of the other races. genetic diseases, cross-species infection rates, the whole nine yards. well, i hope you said yes. sounds like a big deal. it is. and since it means spending more time outside of medlab... ...i figured i'd clear it with you first. not a problem. dr. hobbs can pick up any slack should there be an emer... - did you say cross-species infection rates? - yes. it's not a big problem yet... ...but alien biologies range all over the place. there's not much common ground... ...but it's been known to happen. - to humans? on occasion, yeah. we have to have a system of standardizing lengths of quarantine... ...and developing vaccines and... - could you put that in writing for me? yeah, i guess i could. good. have it on my desk in half an hour and thank delenn for the idea. i gotta go ruin somebody's day. i was thinking about what you said the other day... ...about wanting to serve the alliance more than you do... ...which is already considerable. as you may know... ...the cruiser that was going to take londo back to centauri prime... ...was sabotaged and destroyed. he has many enemies in the royal court. he has many enemies everywhere. it's what he does best. if we lose the centauri, we lose one of our most important allies. so we cannot allow anything to happen to him. i agree. he should have a bodyguard assigned to him... ...at all times while he is there. someone we can rely on... ...someone we can trust. someone strong... strong enough to... you can't be serious. just think what a symbol it would make. to have a narn guarding the life of a centauri. well, yes, it would mean my people will now have two targets... ...to shoot at instead of just the one. - or they will learn from your example. the alliance is about learning to overcome our distrust... ...and form a new community. - can you think of a better symbol? - no, and i'm trying, believe me. you would naturally have to accompany him on all state business... ...and be there to guard him in the palace, in the royal court. a narn in the centauri royal court? it is a curiously satisfying image, delenn. yes, it is. all right, delenn, i accept, if only to see their faces. thank you. this is the greatest challenge of my life. why i'm thanking you for that, i don't know, but there it is. thank you. captain. you'll be pleased to know we're finished. the prisoners have been located and arrested... ...and will be on the next shuttle out. - good. good. i can't wait to get them out of here. unfortunately, there has been a complication. what complication? these telepaths have been traveling around for upwards of three, four years. they've been in and out of every federation in the cluster. to planets that aren't even on the charts. they're drifters. it goes with the territory. i understand, but we can't turn them over to your custody... ...until they've had a full medical workup. we have to make sure they're not carrying viruses. you can't be serious. ""earth alliance medical routine, number 725it7."" dr. franklin just hit me with the paperwork a couple of hours ago. ""no interstellar traveler who's been in unknown space... ...shall be allowed within earth-controlled space until after a 60-day quarantine period."" i have to follow the rules, mr. bester, same as you. so you're saying... ...i can't take them? i'm saying you can't take them now. look, i'm just as distressed over this as you are. come back in 60 days, and they're all yours. let me at least take him. i wish i could, but i can't. look, i'm on your side here. i've worked with you, now i'm asking you to work with me. - just for a little while. - i want your personal guarantee... ...you won't let them go. you'll keep them in custody. - especially this one. - you have it. they will not be allowed to leave babylon 5. i'll put it in writing if you like. all right. as a down payment on what i hope will be a long and rewarding relationship... ...l'll wait the 60 days. i've waited this long, another month or two won't matter. just keep an eye on them, captain. don't trust them for a second... ...because, sooner or later, they will turn on you. you know all about that, don't you, byron? see you in 60 days. wait until their ship has left, then leave the key to the cell where they can find it. then turn your back for, say, 10 minutes. i have just stuck my neck out for you. i don't like doing it... ...but i had my orders. i've gotten you a 60-day reprieve. that's all i could do. that's all i had to do. after 60 days, maybe we'll figure out something. if not... i understand. thank you. and one more thing: now that i've promised him that you or your people will not leave the station... ...l, too, am stuck with that promise, and so are you. get on over to medlab and have dr. franklin have a look at you. i will. after the rest of my people are freed. good day. - he's an interesting man. - he's a martyr. i've seen it before. we had a guy on lo just like him. real charismatic. got this whole movement going around him. there's nothing more appealing than knowing someone will die for you. and nothing more dangerous. g'kar? you've assigned g'kar as my bodyguard? yes. i think your generosity in working with him... ...will be an excellent symbol of unity for all the races who have joined the alliance. - a symbol. - yes. - did you try this line on g'kar? - i did. - and did it work? - completely. great maker. all right, all right, delenn. but mark my word, this is going to be trouble. everything of value is, londo. have a good flight. i want the aisle seat. oh, no, no. you sit on the inside. i want the aisle. if you sit on the aisle, i cannot protect you. but... ...i don't like the inside. it's too cramped. i become nauseous. i'll make sure they have a supply of space sickness bags. - captain? - lieutenant, care to join me? - i'm having a quick bite before i crash. - no, i ate something a little while ago. i just wanted to say that i heard how you handled the telepath problem. - that was good thinking. - adequate. solves the immediate problem, but that's all i had to do. i learned that on my last command. you don't have to solve every problem all at once. problems are solved in pieces. if you're on the seventh floor of a burning building, you can die or jump out the window. once you're out the window, you're alive for another two seconds... ...during which time you figure out the solution to the next problem. and so on. but this telepath problem, it's gonna take me a while to unravel. well, you did the right thing. that's what matters. i hope so. i really do. but to tell you the truth... ...i get this nagging suspicion that maybe bester was right. this thing will blow up in our face. it worries me. i also have this nagging feeling that i'm forgetting something. i'm sure you'll figure it out. good night, captain. good night, lieutenant. oh, no. - lochley to security. - security here. i said, let me the hell out of here! - you can release mr. garibaldi now. - about time!

1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"you unlock this door with the key of imagination. beyond it is another dimension- a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. you're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. you've just crossed over into the twilight zone. okay, and thank you for calling. yeah. we'll be watching. that was colonel connacher, honey. he says daddy is just fine. will he... will he be going up soon? in just about an hour. that's what colonel connacher said. do you want to go back to sleep? i don't blame you. i can't sleep either. i'll tell you what. i'll make some coffee for me and some cocoa for you. and you wash your face and hands and comb your hair. and then we'll turn on the television set, okay? okay. be safe, bob. be safe, darling. and come back. in the vernacular of space this is t minus one hour- 60 minutes before a human being named major robert gaines is lifted off from the mother earth and rocketed into the sky farther and longer than any man ahead of him. call this one of the first faltering steps of man to sever the umbilical cord of gravity and stretch out a fingertip toward an unknown. shortly, we'll join this astronaut named gaines and embark on an adventure, because the environs overhead- the stars, the sky, the infinite space- are all part of a vast question mark known as the twilight zone. huh. pulse normal? reasonable. someplace between nonchalance and panic. i know the feeling. i called helen. she's fine. says to tell you they'll be waiting. bless you for that. do you have any messages for the angels? hmm... give them a kiss for me- any that you meet. on my last orbit, i'll lasso a pair of gossamer wings and ship them down to you air express- collect. kind of an odd feeling, knowing i'll be moving around the earth for a week. that's progress. gus grissom went 302 miles, glenn made three orbits, schirra handled six. and you, bobby boy, are going to go round and round. and, when you come back down, maybe we'll be that much closer to filing a claim on some more sky. good luck, buddy. thanks, bill. thanks a lot. this is capcom. time is now at t minus one minute better hurry. this is capcom. the mx ten countdown is now t minus t minus 20 seconds 19... 18... 17... 16... 15... 14... 13... 12... 11... ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one... zero. go ahead, ten. we read you loud and clear. zero g, and i feel fine. spacecraft is beginning to turn now. roger. turnaround has started. spacecraft is almost over. i can see the booster just a couple of yards behind me. it's quite a sight. roger, ten. we still read you loud and clear. next transmission, bermuda. roger. understand next transmission, bermuda. phebus ten, bermuda. capcom tech on hm. phebus ten, this is zanzibar captech. we have solid telemetry contact. phebus ten. capcom calling phebus ten. we now have i.o.s., over. phebus ten, your voice transmissions are starting to fade very badly. capcom, capcom, this is phebus ten. i've lost contact with you. i've lost radar here! i've lost radar! we don't have contact here, either. no contact at all. capcom tech calling phebus ten. capcom, capcom, this is phebus ten. open the blinds, nurse. yes, doctor. well, how about it, gaines? can you talk? sure. sure, i can talk. hey, billy. what happened? well, we were waiting for you to wake up to tell us, bob. tell you? i can't tell you anything, i blacked out. we lost you on radar and radio. absolutely no contact. it boils down to this, gaines- you're the only one who can explain it. i can't explain anything. i had an odd sensation. last thing i remember is the 15th orbit. after that, i don't remember anything except this bed. i couldn't reach the cape at all. i kept trying. why don't you let him get some sleep? i think he'll feel a little clearer later on. i won't be any clearer than i am right now. how could you lose me on radar? bill, do you mean to tell me every single tracking station blacked out? really, gentlemen, i... just one last question, please. bob, there's only one way you could head back toward earth. that's just to spiral in, and then head for water. your spacecraft was found, intact, 46 miles from where you were launched. intact, bob, on the ground. there was no evidence of any damage, not even a dent. somehow, some way, you brought that spacecraft in, and you landed her. tell me how. would you please explain to me how you performed an absolutely impossible act? i didn't. i had nothing to do with it. i blacked out, general. i simply blacked out. there was some factor up there, something which i had no control over, something which must have... must have taken over for me. hmm. okay, uh... we'll talk about it later. this whole thing is temporarily classified- i mean everything about it. we'll simply make the statement that he regained entry and he landed. he's shaken up but not seriously hurt. and that's the feed. no extensions, no enlargements beyond that after we've been able to probe this we might be able to come up with but, in the meantime, it's a one-line release. ""he got back down."" unquote. you get some rest, bob. talk to you later. yeah, you, uh... sleep it off. there's an explanation for everything. well, don't worry about it now. you're, uh, all doped up, and you're also dead tired. you sleep it off, and i'll see about getting you a leave to get on home. so rest easy, pal. bill? all along, i thought there was some kind of malfunction up there- fuel or propulsion or just communication. maybe the malfunction was closer to home. maybe it was right up here maybe astronaut robert gaines went off the tracks. maybe he couldn't cut the mustard. look, you talk like that- you think like that- and you'll come around to believing it. and that's stupid, bob. we're dealing with nine natural laws plus a whole string of imponderables. and reasons are going to come out- legitimate, rational reasons. now, you just lie there and breathe through your nose. i'll call helen again and tell her you're resting and you'll be home soon. will i? will i be home? yeah. unless you persuade all the people around here that you need an attendant. dream good. i'll see you later. well? oh, it'll all come out in the wash. will it? let me tell you something, colonel... a man is sent up into space, and then he orbits. there are only three ways he can break off contact. one is ionization, and that didn't occur. the other is sunspots, and that didn't occur. the third is the man's death, and he's lying there on that bed breathing five by five. all right, i'm waiting for a fresh alternative, one i can take without flinching. one maybe i can repeat to the president without worrying about him sticking me in a rubber room. what happened to gaines? where was he for six solid hours when nobody in the world could find him? how did he make a reentry without burning up into a flake? sometime we'll have to ask him. give her my love. thanks for services rendered. i'll talk to you later. no question about it. home, james. welcome home. what's the matter, bob? is that what you did for therapy put up that fence? what do you mean? that fence wasn't there when i left last week. are you kidding me? that fence was there when we bought the house. outer space does things to memories, doesn't it? yeah. yeah, so it appears. america's latest manned orbital spaceflight ends on a note of mystery today. with a cloak of secrecy being placed over the entire project. millions were watching the orbital flight on television when, suddenly, the pictures were interrupted with a terse announcement that no further coverage would be forthcoming. general stanley eaton announced late this afternoon that further information would be forthcoming at a later date but that, for the moment, all aspects of astronaut gaines' flight would continue to be top secret pending further investigation of data. you got any more coffee out there? i'm making some. it'll be better in a minute. i'm going upstairs and put on a bathrobe. i'll be right back. do you want maggie to go get it for you? both you and maggie have been treating me like a cross between an eccentric millionaire and a piece of fragile dresden. i'll get my own bathrobe, woman. be right back. that's funny. some chicken colonel back at the base is going to be running home in his undershirt. bob, your coffee's ready. you want us to bring you up a cup? no, honey. i'll be right down. want to hear something funny? i ran off with somebody's shirt- a full colonel's, no less. bob? what? are you all right? helen... without trying to scare you, and without trying to make you wonder whether i've still got all my marbles, i'd like to ask you a question. what is it? when i left- when i walked out of here- what was my rank? your rank? what was my rank? what do you mean? wasn't i a major? haven't i been a major for 13 months? are you serious? no, i'm playing games with you. helen, i want you to tell me. you're a colonel, bob. you're a full colonel. you've been a colonel since last march? last march. i want to say something to you now. i, um... i don't know what happened up there. i have no idea. but, uh... i know you don't want to talk about it- that's why we haven't said anything- but, uh... something must have happened, bob. some delusions. some distortions. like that fence outside the house. i don't remember it. and yet you said it had been there when we bought the house. and that business with bill connacher. he told me he called you before the flight. he made it a point to tell me. and then, afterward... afterward, he said there'd been no such it's unimportant. it's insignificant, really. and yet... and yet it all seems to be part of some sort of crazy pattern. something is very wrong, because he did tell me he called. that fence wasn't there, and those eagles have never been on my collar before because, when i left you, um... you told me once that there are whole areas of space medicine that we know practically phenomena and reaction patterns that can only be guessed at. i'm sure this is one of them. i'm sure there's nothing wrong with you but a... couple of fixations that are going to go away with time. now... let's go downstairs and have a cup and don't let a white fence and a promotion end the world for you. if that's as far as it goes, i'll try not to. but what if... what if other things...? um... i'd like colonel william connacher, please. i was, uh... i was just, uh... going to call bill connacher to ask him if he'd like to... like to what? come over for dinner. bob, i, uh... i just called bill to have him give me some reassurance. i remember that... that he said once that there are some aspects to prolonged weightlessness that makes... look, really, like i said, i'm all right. it's you people i'm worried about. now, where's my coffee? i'll get it for you. don't break any more saucers, mother's helper. i'll try not to. helen? helen, i think it'd be a whole lot better- a whole lot better- if we dropped all the pretenses. if you think there's something wrong with me, just say so. and honey, i'd consider it a major favor- if you wouldn't walk past me on tiptoe with forced smiles and ""there's nothing wrong with you"" dialogue. all right? all right. ahh! i helped mommy make the pie. you know, someday, i'm going to lose you to a navy ensign who'll marry you for your father's money and your cooking. now, honey, you know i don't take sugar. maggie... honey, what's the matter? nothing. nothing's the matter. maggie, here. tell daddy what's the matter. daddy... daddy, you're different. well, how, honey? how am i different? i don't know. i don't know, but you are. youaredifferent. you're very different. there... there's something wrong. maggie! what does she mean? i don't know. what does she mean? what does she mean, i'm different? well, am i? am i, helen? have i changed somehow between now and when i left? i can't... i can't explain it to you. i don't know how. i have changed, haven't i? there is something different about me. the child sensed it. you have, too. you have, haven't you? yes, i have. how? i... i don't know. i... i just don't know. it's... it's just that you're... you're not the same somehow. you didn't have to call bill connacher. that wasn't necessary. tomorrow i'll turn myself in for psychiatric help. i don't know what it is that happened. something did. something is tearing us all apart. something so remote, we can't even put it into words. something... something, until we it's going to wreck us, helen. ivan, there was nothing he could tell you that occurred in space that could give us some key or something to all this? nothing that he could relate to me. i wouldn't recommend that he remain here, however. for the time being, i'd like to treat him have him come in at intervals, but in no way suggest to him that he's in an aberrant condition requiring psychological treatment. this is one of those instances where the psychology of the situation requires very careful handling. we're right back where we started, then. uh... mrs. gaines, i don't mean to sound callous. he's an exceptional gentleman, that husband of yours. i think he'll be out of the woods in no time. my concern happens to be, very specifically, a space project, not a man. i understand, sir. mrs. gaines, what about that fence? it was there when we bought the house. and when did he seem surprised that it was there? the moment that he came home yesterday morning. really a very strange collection of delusions. a white picket fence... a story... his own rank... and the last thing he said was he doubted very much if president kennedy would pin any medals on him. president who? kennedy. someone named john kennedy. who's john kennedy? someone who colonel gaines has decided is president of the united states. and i share your bewilderment. i never heard of him either. twilight zonewill continue after station identification. it isn't easy to say. well... if it isn't easy to say, then it's better said, so get it out. maggie's noticed it, too. noticed what? that there's something... there's something differentabout him. it's something i can't put my finger on, but... there's some... there's something different. suggesting what? suggesting nothing. something or everything. what can it suggest? simply that there's a man in my house who... a man in your house who what? the question is, a man in my house whoiswhat? better, a man in my house who is who? i think you just overshot me, unless i'm reading you very wrong. no, maybe you're reading me very right. reassure me, bill. tell me that, uh... this thing my daughter and i have this ice-cold tell us that we're just being carried away by his problem. tell us... tell us... tell us that the man in this house hello, bill. how are you? fine. i just dropped over to see how you were. me? well, that depends. depends on just what are the current standards for sanity- the acceptable outer limits. i've been going over a set of encyclopedias up there, and jotting down some notes. i've uncovered some very revealing items. there are some pretty basic historical facts that simply don't jibe. for example, it talks about a man named anderson who was sent by the united states government to supervise the construction of the panama canal. so? so, i never heard of anyone it happened to be a man it also talks about an american ace named eddie rickenbacker from world war i who was lost on a raft in the next war and never found. that's right. he crashed, and that was the end of it. but that wasn't the end of it. the raft was found. rickenbacker was saved. he became the president of an airlines company. i've got dozens of items like that. men talked about who never existed. men who existed and not even mentioned. historical events that i know happened a certain way somehow, according to the encyclopedia, didn't happen, or happened another way. the things i remember are not delusions. they're the legitimate recollections of things but somehow, some way, this world seems to have turned upside down for me. well, not in every way, you understand. uh... by and large, the people are the same. the names, the streets, the mutual recollections we all have of people and events. it's as if there were... there were another world parallel to mine. as if this world were almost a twin, except for some minor differences that happened somewhere along the line of evolution. bob, for the love of heaven... do you want to follow that line of reasoning? because, if you do, there are a couple of built-in conditions that go along with it. conditions that i don't think you or anyone else wants to admit. first and foremost, they happen to be that if all if you suddenly uncovered a theory that there are two earths, two sets of people, two histories- and you somehow, inexplicably, crossed over to the other dimension- then you're not who we think you are. and we're not who you think we are. maggie? bob! let's get it out, shall we? i'm so sick of tiptoeing and whispers. maggie! come down here, baby. come down right away. honey... think this over before you answer... but answer. who am i, honey? tell mommy and colonel connacher who i am. bob, please. no. now, sweetheart... you say whatever's on your mind. tell them who i am. i don't know who you are. maggie, this is your daddy. this is your daddy. he's not my daddy. i don't know who he is. oh, that wasn't fair. you've taken a little child, impressionable- you've superimposed on her your own doubts. i've done nothing of the sort. i merely let her say out loud what helen's been thinking all along. and, heaven help me, what i've been thinking. what you've just told me is fantastic. how can you possibly...? it's incredible. incredible. i helped build that spacecraft. i know it very well. and this one is not the same one we sent off. it's almost a twin to it, down to the very last nut and bolt, but it's simply not the same spacecraft. it's a different vehicle. it's almost as if it came out of the same mold, but every now and then- in the wiring, in the control panel there's a tiny insignificant alteration. you add them all up and you come up with one very irrevocable fact: colonel gaines went up in one spacecraft, but he's obviously come back in another. that leaves us with two alternatives. colonel gaines actually blacked out and has no knowledge of what occurred. or two: colonel gaines is not who we think he is. colonel... i want you to examine this vehicle carefully. i want you to be able to say to me, without a single shred of doubt, that this is the spacecraft you were sent up in, and the spacecraft you came down in. this is of the essence now. phebus ten, bermuda. capcom tech m.h.m. you understand me? what? what's the matter with you? bob, what the general is trying to get at is that there are delusions that a man can suffer under stress. now, all we want to do now is try to retrace the chronology from the blastoff through the orbits. and we want you to check over i am talking about a microscopic check, now, bob. we want to make absolutely certain that we can separate what is delusion from what might conceivably be an incredible series of events. the weather in the recovery are is excellent. bob, what's the matter with you? three-foot waves, only one-tenth cloud coverage, ten miles visibility. don't you hear that voice? phebus ten, phebus ten... capcom tech, do you read me? don't you hear that voice? what are you talking about? what voice are you talking about? leave the retro package on through the entire reentry. gaines will have to override... that voice. ...to 0.05... that voice! retract the scope. do you read? don't you hear that voice? recommend you go to reentry attitude and... we'll give you the countdown on retro-sequence time, bob. you're looking good. we have only 50 seconds to retrograde. over. i'll give you a mark. 45... mark. i am on 8scs now, and backing it up manually. 30 seconds, bob. capcom, this is phebus ten. the retro warning is on. roger, bob. leave your retro pack on through your pass over texas. do you read? roger. five... four... three... two... one... fire. retros are firing. i'm starting my reentry now. i'm going to fly by wire. i'm down to 15% on manual. capcom, this is phebus ten. it's a real fireball out there. how are you doing? what's your general condition? how are you feeling? i'm feeling... i'm feeling fine. condition is good. there's an awful lot of fire out there. capcom... one last question: go ahead, bob. go ahead. who's the president of the united states? say again, would you, bob? we don't think we got that. say again. who is the president of the united states? it sounds like you're asking who the president is. that's precisely the question. i hope you said kennedy. i hope you said kennedy. open the blinds, nurse. yes, doctor. our wandering boy is awake. bill. right here, buddy. how you feeling, gaines? that depends. did you hear that last question i asked up there? just before reentry? you asked who the president is. was that some sort of a gag? i didn't hear the answer. it was no gag. president kennedy. you were only gone two days, major, what happened on that second morning, gaines, we lost all contact with you for a period no radar, no contact at all. we couldn't find out what was wrong here. and we asked you that question several times after we picked you up again, but you ignored it. six hours? that's how long it took. then you came back in loud and clear. i think later, sir. right now, i think he should rest. bill... something... something i know you're not going to believe this. i'm not absolutely certain that i believe it myself. there's another dimension. i don't know how it exists or where it exists. but there's another world, parallel to ours- the same people, the same places, most of the same chronology of events. except, now and then, there's something a little bit how do you know all this? because i was there, general. i was there for almost a week. that's impossible. we only lost you for about six hours. we had contact with you all the rest of the time. i can't help that, sir. during that six hours, i lived out a week. doing what? looking at our counterparts. looking at us. us? us, as we exist in a parallel world. one that exists alongside, but which we can't see. the world i stumbled into. i don't know how. some kind of space-time continuum, some warpage. there's a doorway up there somewhere into it. it exists. every now and then, i think it's possible for somebody to fall through it, and i did. how did you get back, bob? i don't even know that. all i can remember is running toward the spacecraft. then... i was up there again... and then i was back here. well... bob, i think, uh... sleep on this for a little while, will you? why? because... i think, uh... this may just be a delusion. delusion? bill, i can recount to you every minute and everything that happened. every line of dialogue, every person that i met. i could recall to you the streets, the places, everything. this was no delusion. it was no dream. i have no proof. i've told you that. mm-hmm. well, um, okay, major... we'll talk about it later. did anybody phone helen? she, uh... asked what you wanted for supper. will i be able to leave? at least for an overnight. mm-hmm. i want you back first thing in the morning for some critique. i want to have a look at those psychiatrists' faces when you start talking to them about parallel dimensions. meanwhile, get some rest, major. one last question. be my guest. if we each have a counterpart, and you saw them, where was yours, bob? i don't know, but he was a colonel. a full colonel. i hope he got back, 'cause he has a very beautiful wife and a very lovely little daughter. i hope he got back. what do you think? uh-uh. i don't think. not on this one, sir. what kind of trauma...? something to set him tilt like that? i... can we call it ""tilt,"" sir? oh, what else? another dimension? another world parallel to ours? up there, who knows what's rational and what isn't? we don't even know the rules, sir, let alone the facts. we're... we're like little ants that have just made it to the desert. now we say we've conquered the sahara and we haven't conquered anything. we're only starting to find the mysteries, general. we haven't even begun to solve them. we're going to do a lot of groping through a lot of dark nights, through a lot of dark space, before we find the clues, let alone the answers. we've got a long way to go, sir. okay. general? there's a message from capcom, sir. i'll give it to you as we got it. it doesn't make much sense. let me be the judge of that. what's the message? capcom reports telemetry with an unidentified space vehicle. what? yes, sir. they had voice communication for about a minute and a half. the spacecraft identified itself asastro seven, and the person in it said- what'd he say? what'd he say? he identified himself as a colonel robert gaines. he asked for reentry data. colonelrobert gaines? yes, sir. then we got some garbled stuff, and then nothing. and then what? and then nothing, sir. we lost the visual sighting. we lost all voice. the thing just disappeared. get a transcript of everything have it brought to my office. and keep trying to raise, uh... yes, sir. we're still trying. good. uh... you keep me in touch. yes, sir. well, bill... you certainly were right when you said we haven't even begun. we don't have all the answers. we've got a long way to go. what's on your mind?

1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,"i believe we have at last devised the perfect television these two gentlemen are its leading characters. they are a father and son team, defenders of the underdog. each week they find a new maiden in distress, or a new dog as the case may be. and thus we have a completely different story, yet retain the same magic ingredients. being father and son not only gives them some excellent freudian conflicts, but also enables them to gang up on a single opponent. of course, the son furnishes the fire enthusiasm, while the father is the brains of the team. in each and every story we have a dramatic courtroom scene in the court of king arthur. our heroes ride horseback for the benefit of western fans, and for a little extra fun i have quietly sharpened the lances, thus assuring us some excellent operating room scenes. i don't see how it can miss. of course, just as no rose is complete without thorns, so no television show is complete without the following. would you send the car around, please? thank you. eve! eve! that kid has been in here again. i'm sorry, howard. look, if his mother can't control him, i won't have him in the house at all. i'm sure it wasn't addie's fault. you're always making excuses for her, aren't you? and gilly. you know, he's a little nuisance. well, he doesn't have any friends of his own, and he can't stay with addie all the time. she has her work to do. i just can't stand having other people's children around. of course, it would be different if we had one of our own. howard. i know. you want addie here, so i guess i'll have to put up with a boy. you know, eve, addie is a luxury. we already have three servants, and we don't really need a housekeeper. excuse me. oh, has gilly been in here again? yes, he's been in here again. i'm sorry, mr. raiden. he's been with me in the kitchen all afternoon. he must have worn it off while i was counting the laundry. addie, you like working for us here, don't you? you get a good wage. your boy is going to a very good school. you both have a home. all i ask is that you just keep him out of my study. i'm sorry, mr. raiden. it won't happen again. please. please see that it doesn't, huh? well, who's mr. lewis? he's the baseball coach. he put tommy harris on third base and i pitched. i got everybody out except john casey. well, he's a big boy. he's almost 12. of course he is. if i do all right in practice tomorrow, i'll pitch against st. martin's on thursday. well, that's wonderful, gilly. hey, mom, you know what i got on my arithmetic test? now what? i got 92. well, that makes me very proud. mom, you know what? what? i like this room. it's so pretty. now look, gilly, you've got to be out of this room before mr. raydon gets home. when is that? oh, in about an hour, i guess. okay, mom. addie, will you come in the kitchen and help me with this silly animal? he just won't hold still for the liniment i'm supposed to put on him. doesn't he know it's for his own good? come on, smidge, let's be brave about the whole thing. put that down. you're not even supposed to be in this room at all. mr. raydon. oh, gilly. do you know what that clock was worth? how could you do such a thing? i didn't mean it. it slipped. eve? i didn't mean to break the clock, mrs. raydon. i'm sorry. it's all right, gilly. it's all right. yes, it's perfectly all right, isn't it? you can do anything you like here, gilly. mrs. raydon doesn't mind. howard, please. gilly, you run along. i promise i'll pay for the clock, mr. raydon. not out of my money you won't. i want you and your son out of here, addie, for good. you don't mean that. i do mean it. i put up with this business for your sake, but this is the end of it. we'll keep gilly at the school. you won't have to see so much of him. i won't have to see him at all, and neither will you. i'll give you a month's salary, but i want you out of here on saturday. he means it this time. he really means it. i knew it wouldn't work. things could have been so different. gilly? gilly? i didn't mean to do it. it's all right, gilly. sit down. i'll get you some cake and milk. it was just so pretty, i wanted to touch it. i know, gilly. mr. raydon's very angry with me, isn't he? yes, sarah? - i left mr. raydon's milk on the stove, ma'am. oh, fine. - is he feeling any better? no, he's gone to bed. i'll take it up to him. good night, mrs. raydon. - good night, sarah. thank you. okay, miss mitchie. come on. eve! eve! addie! addie! addie! (...) eve! what's the matter? - it's howard. he's sick. addie! i'm coming! he was all right when we went to sleep, and then he was calling out to me. howard? howard? well, don't just stand there. get a doctor. call dr. borgman. i'll call him. howard? he's not breathing. but there was nothing wrong with him. i think he's dead. you always wanted this to happen. you've done this to my son. you've killed him. mr. malloy, i'm so glad you could come. i wanted to see you again, mrs. strain. i've just left mrs. raiden. oh, how is she? she asked if you could bring her a change of clothes. i can't bear to think of her in that awful place. do you know if she's been sleeping? she's always had trouble sleeping. i can't believe that all this is happening. mr. strain, it's that woman's fault, that awful old woman. what woman? mrs. raiden. you mean howard raiden's mother? yes. she hates eve. she's always hated her. she hates eve just because she married her son. that's why she accused eve of killing him. it's the state who made the accusation, mrs. strain. now, it's my job to prove they're wrong, and you can help me do it. i've told you everything i know. have you? what about that drunken gardener? he was terribly angry at mr. raiden when he fired him. it could have been him. why didn't the police arrest him? there wasn't any case against the gardener. well, there isn't any case against eve. isn't there? they think there is. they say she bought the poison that caused raiden's death. she gave him the milk that contained the poison. and worst of all, she might have had a motive. that's not true. howard raiden's mother says it is. she claims eve wasn't much of a wife to her son. she's a nasty, vicious old woman. and she knows about jack wentworth. what does she know? i don't know. what do you know? nothing. nothing? well, the question is, will the jury believe her? will they believe that eve was an unfaithful wife? do you think they will? i'm not a fortune teller, mrs. strain. but i've been studying the testimony at the preliminary hearing. as far as i'm concerned, they couldn't convict jack the ripper on the evidence they've got. do you mean that? well, they've only got one witness. an hysterical, possessive mother. she'll try and make eve sound like a jezebel. maybe that's how the jury will see her at first. when i put eve herself on the stand, that'll be a different story. then it'll be all right. they'll let her go. i've been a criminal lawyer for 10 years, mrs. strain. i've done pretty well. you know how? i never believed i was going to lose a case. i do. mrs. raiden, you were living with your son and his wife at the time of his death. i was. was your relationship with your daughter-in-law a friendly one? we understood each other. would you describe your son's marriage as happy? i would not. was there friction between them? howard did his best to hide it from me, but i knew the truth. what truth? that she'd married him for his money. and what makes you say that? she was wildly extravagant with my son's income. she spent over $20,000 a year on clothes alone. did he object to her spending so much? not at first. he was too infatuated. she took advantage of howard. i tried to make him see the truth, but he wouldn't listen. a man has to learn those things for himself. would you say he finally did learn the truth about his wife? not all of it. he never knew the worst part. that she was a filthy, evil. objection, your honor. prosecution is encouraging the witness to be abusive. mr. halstead, please confine yourself to questions of fact. yes, your honor. then to your knowledge, your son knew nothing of the affair between his wife and jack wentworth. objection. - well, i'll rephrase the question. was your son aware that eve raiden had been seeing jack wentworth? he knew nothing about it. it was the one thing about her that i couldn't bear to tell him. did you ever see them together? - i did. it was on a friday afternoon. i'd left the house that morning to go to a committee meeting of a charity organization to which i belonged. but i returned sooner than i expected. and sooner than my daughter-in-law expected. you haven't told me anything about yourself. well, there's nothing much to tell. i'm married, i'm well, and i'm keeping busy. mm-hmm. go ahead, tell me you're happy. tell me what a great guy howard is. tell me how you never regretted marrying him. not even for a minute. and then tell me you don't want to see me anymore. but i do want to see you. there's no reason why i shouldn't. let's have lunch next week, huh? i'd love to. oh, hello, mother. i thought you weren't going to be home until this evening. commit to postpone the bazaar for a week. the chairman is ill. oh, this is jack wentworth, an old friend. this is mrs. raiden, howard's mother. are you an old friend of my son's, mr. wentworth? yes, i met him once. i think i'd better be running over. you must come and have dinner with us sometime, mr. wentworth. yes, yes, i'd like that. look, eve, i'll be at the plaza in case you want me for anything. say goodbye to annie for me, huh? goodbye. goodbye. mrs. raiden. then you actually saw them in each other's arms. i heard them and i saw them. you said nothing about this to your son? i didn't like to carry tales. besides, she would have denied it. she could make howard believe anything. mrs. raiden, did your son and his wife quarrel on several occasions? yes. as a matter of fact, there was a quarrel the day before his death, wasn't there? yes, there was. i was present at the time. would you please tell the court what happened? eve left the house early that morning on one of her frequent shopping trips. when she returned about seven o'clock that evening, howard and i were in the study. i can't understand why eve didn't tell me about these. she should have come to me. i'm afraid she doesn't tell you everything, howard. oh, mother, please. hi. boy, these new shoes are killing me. that's mad. he won't look as if someone died in the stock market again, huh? do you know what these are? no idea. well, maybe you'd better take a look at them. a man came to my office today. he came to see me about you. he was from a collection agency. seems you haven't paid these bills. so the store forwarded them to an agency for collection. it was very embarrassing. poor darling. eve, you owe seven thousand dollars. well, the price of hats has gone up. hats, furs, shoes, jewelry. howard, you sound like an elevator operator. don't be so dull. i don't think there's anything dull about seven thousand dollars. it's the dullest thing i've heard all day. eve, you spent seven thousand dollars. and that's only in one store. we haven't heard from the others yet. well, tell them to wait. they take long enough with their deliveries. let them wait for their money. eve, darling, you don't seem to understand. these bills are weeks overdue. howard gives you a good allowance. what do you do with it? spend it. it's no use, huh? oh, just a minute, eve. mother and i have been talking this over. oh, and what did mother have to say? she reminded me about your annuity. the money gary left you. thank you, mother. i might never have thought of that. eve, you cannot go on spending money this way. you know the condition of the stock market lately. most of my shares are at rock bottom. and i just can't afford to sell until they go up. mother's always right, isn't she? all right, howard. punish me. send me to bed without supper. i'm dieting anyway. eve, i'm not going to pay these bills. you'll have to pay them yourself. you don't mean that. i do mean it. after all, you have ten thousand dollars of your own money. it's only fair that you should use that to pay these bills. but howard, you always wanted me to look well. you always said i should buy nice clothes. within reason, darling, for heaven's sake. within reason. all right, darling. i'll go to the bank tomorrow. i just hate it when you're angry with me. she never had any trouble fooling howard. he was always very weak as far as she was concerned. of course she didn't go to the bank the next day. she never intended to. mrs. raiden, have you ever seen this before? yes, i have. it's a check made out for ten thousand dollars to the order of eve raiden. would you read the signature on this check? it's signed jack wentworth. would you tell the court where you first saw this check? it was in her room. in your daughter-in-law's bedroom? yes. it was the day after howard died. i went into her room after eve had left the house. i thought i might find something from this man wentworth. a letter, perhaps. i found the check. it was in a bureau drawer. mrs. raiden, are we to understand that you found this check among your daughter-in-law's possessions? yes. and you appropriated it without her permission? i had to. i wanted to prove... - very well, mrs. raiden. mr. malloy, was the defense aware of the manner in which this evidence was obtained? we were, your honor. and you wish to make no objection? no, your honor. we believe the exhibit will be explained by the case for the defense. we're willing to accept it in evidence. very well, you may proceed, mr. halstead. mrs. raiden, what did you think when you first saw this check? i knew that no man would give that much money to a woman unless he was a great deal more than a friend. and so you demanded the autopsy. the autopsy which proved your son was murdered. yes. mrs. raiden, you knew your son suffered from a very serious ulcer condition. yes, but i also knew that he took good care of himself. isn't it true that mrs. raiden brought him a glass of warm milk each night before going to bed? yes, and that's how she did it. she put poison in the milk. she thought that we would believe that my son's illness was the cause of his death. but i knew better. i knew that she killed my son. just to keep you from becoming too engrossed in our story, the ground rules of television provide this cooling-off period, after which we shall all be back. welcome back to the alfred hitchcock hour. we missed you. the second half of what really happened will begin after we cross this one-minute moat. you may proceed with your witness, mr. malloy. mrs. raiden, how long were you married to howard raiden? about two years. you had been married before? yes, my first husband was killed in an auto crash about seven years ago. i see. what was your relationship with jack wentworth before your marriage to howard raiden? we were very good friends. was there any romantic interest? yes, before i met howard. where were you living at that time? i was sharing an apartment with addie. with adelaide strain, the woman who is now your housekeeper? yes, we were both widows. she had a child, didn't she? a boy named gilbert? yes. so you married howard raiden and a year later, mr. adelaide strain came to work for you as your housekeeper? well, adelaide had been a wonderful friend to me. i was very happy when howard said we could hire her. the boy came with her? yes. addie and i arranged for him to go to a school in the neighborhood. a private school? the maynard school for boys. now what happened to jack wentworth after your marriage to howard raiden? he went to south america. he's a mining engineer. and when did he return? just this january. you heard mrs. raiden's testimony about finding you and jack wentworth together. was that the first time you saw him after his return? yes, that was the first time. but it wasn't the way she said. you didn't embrace him. but you made it sound all wrong. i didn't even know that jack was in town or that he was coming to see me. it was a surprise addie had arranged. we've got five years to catch up on. i want to hear all about it. well, you remember the company i told you about? the one working the mine up in the andes? yes, i remember. well, it took us almost a whole year to set up operations, but it paid off. we took millions of dollars of tin out of that mining. i'm rich. you really deserve it, jack. i deserve it or not, i've got it. it's just marvelous. thank you. your hands are a little heavier now, isn't it? mm-hmm. you know, on the way over here i passed by a jewelry store and i saw a bracelet that i would have loved to wear. i have everything. everything. well, you haven't told me anything about yourself. well, there isn't much to tell. i'm married and i'm well and i'm keeping busy. you haven't said you were happy. didn't i? i know, i know, i know. you're going to tell me you're happy. you're going to tell me what a great guy howard is. mm-hmm. then you're going to tell me you've never regretted marrying howard, not even for a minute. and then you're going to tell me you don't want to see me anymore. no. no? let's have lunch next week, huh? i don't think we should. hello, mother. i didn't think you were going to be home until this evening. oh, is that what you thought? well, the committee have postponed the bazaar for a week. the chairman is ill. this is jack wentworth. he's an old friend. this is mrs. raiden, howard's mother. well, how do you do, mrs. raiden? how do you do? are you a friend of my son's, mr. wentworth? well, i met him once. i think i should be running along. why don't you come to dinner sometime? i'm sure my son would be only too pleased to see an old friend of eve's. well, thank you. that would be very nice. eve, if you want me, i'll be at the plaza. i'll see you to the door. no, no, no, please. just say goodbye to addie for me. i will. goodbye, eve. goodbye. pleasure, mrs. raiden. i knew what mrs. raiden was thinking, but it wasn't true. i was happy to see jack, but that was all. did you see jack wentworth after that? yes, but there was nothing secretive about it. we met a couple of times for lunch or a cocktail. mrs. raiden, we've heard about a quarrel which took place the day before your husband's death. do you recall that occasion? yes, we quarreled, but it didn't happen the way mrs. raiden said. it wasn't that way at all. boy, these shoes are killing me. yes, it must be very tiring, all this shopping. do you know what these are? no. maybe you'd better take a look at them. a man came to my office this morning from a collection agency. you haven't paid these bills. how do you think i feel about that? oh, howard, i'm sorry. you owe $7,000, eve. $7,000. that's only from one store. we haven't heard from the others yet. i never realized how much i was spending. the stock market has been acting very badly lately. most of my stuff is at rock bottom. i just can't afford to sell any shares. howard, you never discussed money with me. if you'd explained, i would have tried to economize. howard gives you a good allowance every month, but it never seems to be enough for you. i don't know why it is. i'm always running short. i know why. it's dear old addie, isn't it? do you think i don't know the money you spend on her every month? and i'm paying her more than she's worth. and that school she sends her boy to, it's absurd. sending him to an expensive private school. but he has to go to the maynard school. it's the only school close by. besides, addie does pay part of the tuition. there was never any need for addie around here in the first place. but she's my friend. and don't think she hasn't taken full advantage of it. we pay her $500 a month, and what does she do for it? nothing. except a range of few flowers. i'm going to fire her. no. - i'm going to fire her! all right, howard. what do you want me to do about the bills? my mother and i have been talking this over. she thinks you ought to pay them yourself. seems only right to me. but how? well, what about the annuity gary left you? i don't think there's enough. well, it should be over $10,000. i want these bills paid. and i want them paid by the end of the week. you go to the bank tomorrow and draw out the money. all right, howard. i'll go to the bank tomorrow. but i knew i couldn't go to the bank. there was really only one place i could turn. eve? ah, you look beautiful. well, this is certainly a lucky break for me seeing you again so soon. you may not think it's so lucky when you hear the reason. oh? oh, thank you. uh, daiquiri? you remembered. daiquiri, please. i'm in trouble, jack. i've made a terrible mess of things. oh, how terrible. you remember that annuity gary left me? mm-hmm. well, it's all gone, every cent. i kept drawing on the capital. you've been helping addie with gilly's school fees. i know. she told me. well, the fees are high, and he needs a lot of things. but i've been extravagant with myself. i can't help it. i just love clothes. hey, you, uh, should have them. i owe a lot. $7,000. you know, five years ago, that was all the money in the world as far as i was concerned. right now, it doesn't sound like so much, though. might as well be a million. howard insists i pay it. see, he thinks i still have my own money. well, he can afford to pay it. but he won't. he's furious with me. he even wants to get rid of addie, and i don't know what she'd do about gilly's schooling if he did. i see. well, thank you. thank you. well, uh, why don't we make it, uh, make it out for $10,000? that's an awful lot of money. i know, but you may have some bills you've forgotten about. it's not as pretty as a diamond bracelet, but... i'll pay you back. i promise i will. you just promised me one thing. that you'll call me any time you're in trouble. will you remember that? that was how i got the check. i wasn't proud of myself for it. but i had nothing to be ashamed of, either. mrs. raiden. was there anything... illicit in your relationship with jack wentworth? no, nothing. did you love your husband? yes. were you unfaithful to him in any way? no, never. mrs. raiden. isn't it a fact that you brought your husband a glass of warm milk every evening? yes, i did. did you put poison in that glass of milk the night he died? no, i didn't. are you sure? i swear i didn't. no further questions. your witness, mr. halstead. mrs. raiden. you know your husband died of a lethal dose of vaconitine. yes. the tincture of vaconitine is found in certain liniment preparations. it was contained in a product called k944, used in the treatment of skin ailments in animals. are you familiar with this product? yes. you own a dog, i believe. yes. you recently purchased some of this k944, didn't you? the vet recommended it. however, the bottle you purchased was never found in the house. do you know what became of it? i can't imagine what happened to it. but you know what happened to some of it, don't you? you used some of it to kill howard raiden. i didn't. i had no reason to kill howard. no reason? no reason at all? objection! objection sustained. please do not leave the witness, mr. halstead. mrs. raiden, what was the name of your first husband? gary mitchell. at the time you met him, he was an employee of howard raiden, wasn't he? yes. they didn't get along very well, did they? as a matter of fact, howard raiden fired your first husband, didn't he? i don't see what that has to do... how old were you at the time of that first marriage? seventeen. only seventeen. and how long had you been married when gary mitchell was killed in that wreck? four months. naturally, that disturbed you very much. of course. in fact, you had another reason to be unhappy, didn't you? yes. i was very unhappy, yes. not only because your husband had died, but because he had left you with a child. isn't that true, mrs. raiden? here's a copy of the birth certificate. it proves that you gave birth to a child six months after the death of your first husband. would you like to see it? so, you were a widow at seventeen, with a baby you didn't really want? i did want him. but i couldn't take care of him. i had to find work. i didn't know what to do. yes, it was hard, wasn't it, all that responsibility on someone young and all alone? you needed help. so you turned to the best friend you had. you let adelaide strain look after your child and you went off to work as a fashion model. i was only studying to be a model. i wasn't trained. i was making hardly any money at all. the hours were long and addie offered to take care of gilly for me. and when you started seeing howard raiden, you never told him about the baby. i couldn't. i just couldn't. of course you couldn't. that would have spoiled everything, wouldn't it? i meant to tell him some day. but you never did. you were afraid he wouldn't marry you if you knew about the child, especially a child of gary mitchell's, a man he despised. so you let adelaide strain raise the boy as her own, until you could bring them both into your home. i wanted my baby with me. but howard raiden thought the boy was adelaide strain's, didn't he? and he told mrs. strain he didn't want her to work for you anymore. isn't that what happened? didn't he fire her? yes. and if adelaide strain was forced to go, your son would have gone too? yes. and that's why you had to kill your husband, wasn't it? that's the real reason. i didn't kill him. that's all, mrs. raiden. it is now your duty to weigh these arguments, and the testimony of the witnesses you've heard, in order to determine whether the defendant is innocent or guilty of the charge of first-degree murder. in order to reach that decision, i remind you again that a conviction for the crime of murder requires evidence of both opportunity and motive. you must be convinced that the defendant, eve raydon, had adequate opportunity to commit the act which resulted in the death of her husband, and you must be satisfied that the prosecution has shown just cause for that crime to be committed. if you believe there is a reasonable doubt, then you must return a verdict of not guilty. if you believe that both opportunity and motive have been proved, it is your duty to find the defendant guilty as charged. the jury will now retire to consider their verdict. why didn't you tell me the truth? why did i have to learn it from the prosecution? i couldn't, eve, make me promise. you know the most important fact of all, and you kept your mouth shut. do you know what you've done to our case? if i had known the truth, i could have fought back. now, it's too late. you've handed them the one thing they didn't have before, the motive. but she didn't kill him. she didn't kill him. there are twelve people in that jury room. tell it to them. it'll be a miracle if they believe it now. how long has the jury been out? that's about six hours now. i shouldn't have listened to eve. i should have told them about gilly. ah, don't blame yourself. i'm sure you did what eve wanted. i never thought they'd find out. all these years, no one ever guessed. i don't blame her, jack. she was trying to make a home for gilly. she always intended telling howard. but he proved so impossible. no, i don't blame her, hattie. i just feel so helpless. hello? oh, yes, mr. malloy. about what time did you say? oh, fine, thank you very much. good night. well, the jury is locked up for tonight. we won't know anything until tomorrow morning. if then? they're going to convict her. i don't know, hattie. i just don't know. look, why don't i stop by around nine in the morning and we'll both go to court together. good night, hattie. what's the matter? mr. raiden. mr. raiden's after me. oh, no, gilly, it's just a dream. i was in his room. he came after me. shh, gilly, shh. i couldn't move. my legs couldn't move. no, gilly, it was just a dream. just an awful nightmare. lie down and go to sleep now. there's nothing for you to be afraid of anymore. mom? mom? well, of course, i'll have to report this to the police. you understand that? yes, yes, i know. is she going to be all right, doctor? well, luckily, the poison she took was a slow acting one. yes, she'll be all right. thank you. thank you very much, doctor. mr. wentworth. oh, yes. she left this note in her room. it's addressed to mrs. raiden. oh, well, i'll take it. oh, by the way, where is gilly? he's up in his room. i'll take very good care of him, sir. thank you. my dear steve, it's not enough to say i'm sorry. not when i've made you suffer so much. i really thought it would be all right. i kept hoping and praying all through the trial. a thousand times i wanted to stand up and shout for them to stop. to tell them the truth. that i killed howard. i did it for all of us. please believe me. i just wanted us to be happy. you and me and gilly. to be together always. i thought they would blame howard's death on his illness. and then they arrested you. and i knew that i hadn't solved anything. i'd only made things worse. you've always been so kind to me. i know you'll be kind now and forgive me for what i've done. take care of your boy, eve. he needs you so much. well, mr. halstead? i'm satisfied, your honor. you'll agree then that the jury be dismissed? by all means. then it's over? it's over. not for mrs. strain, i'm afraid. mr. malloy, what's going to happen to addie? i don't know. i'll do everything i can to help her. may i see my son now? you're free to go whenever you wish, mrs. raiden. come on, eve, i'll take you home. would you mind dropping me off? not at all. goodbye. goodbye, your honor. mr. malloy, thank you so much. mr. halstead, you seem a trifle disturbed. your honor, that jury would have brought in a verdict of guilty. wouldn't they? that, counselor, is something we'll never know. you have now seen the whole of what really happened. we shall cross-examine you later. by the way, mrs. strain was subsequently tried and found guilty. she hoped for a suspended sentence, but unfortunately they suspended her. my two stalwart heroes are no longer partners. the split-up was entirely friendly, however. you see, this way they can represent both sides of a case. defending the underdog is fine, but it's usually the upper dog who can pay the big fees. next week, the alfred hitchcock hour will bring you another story. some previews of this will follow the following."
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"who's there? it's your relief, sam. all quiet? didn't see a thing, chief. nobody ever does. whatever the thing is, it's already killed 50 people. i never realized how dark it is down here. stay on your toes, schmitter. keep your phaser in your hand at all times. what good will that do? you saw what happened to ed appel when he shot at it. how about those other people? i'm sorry, schmitter, but we've got to have guards. o.k., chief. i'll do what i can. keep alert. if you hear anything or see anything, call in. somebody can arrive in three minutes. a lot can happen in three minutes. chief, is it true the enterprise is on its way? it's coming. you think it could get here in the next four hours? you'll be all right. [fiery noise] no. aah! come on. aah... schmitter. like the rest of them. burned to a crisp. space -- the final frontier. these are the voyages of the starship enterprise. its five-year mission-- to explore strange new worlds... to seek out new life and new civilizations... to boldly go where no man has gone before. captain 's log -- star date 3196.1. a distress call from the pergium production station on janus 6 has brought the enterprise to that long-established colony. mr. spock, dr. mccoy, and i have beamed down to meet with chief engineer vanderberg, administrative head of janus 6. let's assume there is a monster. what has it done? when did it start? about three months ago, we opened up a new level. sensors gave us an unusually rich pergium reading. not only pergium, whatever you want. uranium, serium, platinum. the whole planet's like that. it's a treasure house. we're aware of that. if mining conditions weren't so difficult, janus 6 could supply the mineral needs of a thousand planets. but what happened? first, the automatic machinery, piece by piece, started to almost disintegrate. metal began dissolving away. there was no reason for it, and our chemists were unable to analyze the corrosive agent. i'm sure there is an answer. it simply has not yet been discovered. yes, it has. i don't know what this butchering monster is, but i know what it's doing. our maintenance engineer sent down to the drifts to repair the corroded machinery. we found him... seared to a crisp. volcanic activity? there is none currently on this planet, captain. he's right. none. at first, the deaths were down deep, but they've been moving up toward our levels. the last man died two days ago three levels below this. same way? burned? i'd like to examine the body. we kept it for you. there isn't much left. roberts will show you. it isn't pretty. you post sentries? guards? of course. five of them have died. who else has seen this? i have. this is ed appel, chief processing engineer. describe it. i can't. i only got a glimpse of it, but it's... big and shaggy. ed shot it. oh. you mean shot at it. no. i mean shot it. with this. fascinating. a good, clean shot. didn't even slow it down. well, i've made my report to you. production's stopped, nobody will go into the lower levels, and i don't blame them. the federation wants pergium, then you'll have to do something about it. that's why we're here. you're all pretty tough, aren't you? starship, phaser banks. you can't get your starship down in the tunnels. no need to. mr. vanderberg, i'll need a complete subsurface chart of all the drifts, galleries, tunnels. you'll get it. mr. vanderberg, what is this? it's a silicon nodule. millions of them are down there. no commercial value. but a geological oddity, to say the least. pure silicon? a few trace elements. look, we didn't call you here so you could collect rocks. thank you, mr. vanderberg. we'll need your complete cooperation. you'll have it. just find that creature, whatever it is. i've got a quota to meet. come on, appel. vast number of tunnels won't make our hunting any easier. schmitter didn't burn to death, not in the usual sense, anyway. explain that. well, there are only fragments of bone and teeth left, but the plant's physician agrees with me -- a chemical corrosion... almost as if he'd been thrown into a vat of extremely corrosive acid. strong enough to eat machinery? strong enough to eat anything you can think of. mr. spock, show me the positions of the deaths and acts of sabotage. here, here, and here. if the times of these incidents are accurate, the creature would have to have moved at an incredible speed. mm-hmm. mr. vanderberg, how recent are these charts? they were made last year. before the appearance of whatever it is? that's right. i see. mr. spock... give us a report on life beneath the surface. within range of our sensors, there is no life, other than the accountable human residents of this colony beneath the surface, uh, at least, no life as we know it. we can't cover all the tunnels on foot. production must be resumed. we must have that pergium! if we could force another appearance of this creature... when that creature appears, men die. [fiery noise] aaaahhhh! too many tunnels. we couldn't possibly -- mr. spock, our sensors can pick up normal life functions at a considerable distance. but what about abnormal life functions? [siren blares] something's happening in the reactor room! back to your stations. look at that. i wouldn't touch it, captain. an extremely active corrosive. traces may linger. kirk! quickly! the main circulating pump for the entire reactor-- it's gone. same indication as shown at the door, captain -- very strong corrosive. is there a replacement for that? no. none. it's outdated, but it always worked fine. spock, onboard? nothing for a device this antiquated. without the pump mechanism, the reactor will go supercritical. it could poison half the planet. we can't shut it down. it provides heat and air and life support for the whole colony. mr. spock, we seem to have been given a choice -- death by asphyxiation... or death by radiation poisoning. a pxk pergium reactor? no, sir. we don't have any spare circulating pump for a thing like that. i haven't seen a pxk in 20 years. can you rig one up? it's vital. i can put together some odds and ends, but it won't hold for long. how long? 48 hours maybe, with luck. 48 hours is better than nothing. gather what you need and beam down here. top priority. aye, captain. i'll be right down. scott out. what happens when it breaks down? hopefully we'll find the missing part by then. small chance. the alternative is to evacuate all you people to the enterprise. a dozen planets depend on you for pergium for their reactor. they're already screaming. reactors closing down, life support systems -- i'm concerned with my people right here, kirk. they're being murdered. find that monster and kill it. the missing pump wasn't taken by accident. it was the one piece of equipment absolutely essential for the operation of the reactor. do you think the creature is trying to push the colonists off the planet? it would seem so. but why now? these production facilities have been in operation for over 50 years. i don't know. but there is a possibility. what's that? life as we know it is universally based on some combination of carbon compounds. but what if life exists based on another element? for instance... silicon? you're creating fantasies, mr. spock. not necessarily. i've heard of the theoretical possibility of life based on silicon, but life of an entirely different order. it's possible that our phasers might not affect it. certainly not phaser i, which is far less powerful than phaser ii. all right. how about this -- a creature that lives deep in the planet below us, at home in solid rock. it seems to me that in order to survive, it would have to have some form of natural armor plating. it could explain much, especially since the colonists are armed only with phaser i. but we have phaser ii. which i could render more effective against silicon. silicon-based life is physiologically impossible, especially in an oxygen atmosphere. it may be, doctor, that the creature can exist for brief periods in such an atmosphere before returning to its own environment. i still think you're imagining things. maybe, but at least it's something to go on. mr. spock, have lieutenant commander giotto assemble the security troops and arm them with phaser ii. you make the proper adjustments. you seem fascinated by this rock. yes, captain. you recall that vanderberg commented there were thousands of these at a lower level-- the level which the machinery opened just prior to the first appearance of the creature. do they tie in? i don't know. speculate. i have already given dr. mccoy sufficient cause for amusement. i'd prefer to cogitate the possibilities for a time. a short time, mr. spock. we have very little. how's it going, scotty? it's a plumber's nightmare, but it'll hold for a bit. it has to hold longer. sorry. that's about the best i can do. [beep beep] kirk here. captain, security officers have gathered in chief vanderberg's office. i'll be right there. scotty, ride herd on it. kind words. tender, loving care. kiss it. baby it. flatter it if you have to, but keep it going. i'll do what i can, sir. you'll proceed from level to level, checking out every foot of opening. you are searching for some sort of creature which is highly resistant to phaser fire. phasers will be set on maximum, and remember this-- 50 people have died. i want no more deaths. except the bloody thing. the creature may or may not attack on sight. however, you must. it is vitally important we get this installation back into production. mr. vanderberg, may i ask at which level you discovered the nodules of silicon? the 23rd. why? commander giotto, take your detail. go directly to the 23rd level. start your search there. aye, aye, sir. do you have reason to suspect this creature may be on that level? it's a possibility we've discussed. keep your people on the top level together at a safe place. i don't know any safe place, captain, the way that thing comes and goes. well, gentlemen, you have your instructions. let's get at it. [sensor wails] mr. spock? find something? adjusting my tricorder to register for silicon. [sensor continues to wail] interesting. traces? a life form, captain... bearing -- 111 degrees. elevation -- 4 degrees. one of our people? no, sir. silicon. come on. [fiery noise] aaaaahhhh! he never even had a chance to fire, captain. it's only been seconds since we heard him scream. the creature must still be around. captain. this tunnel. my readings indicate it was made within the hour, moments ago, in fact. - are you certain? - positive. this tunnel goes out of sight. our best machinery couldn't cut a tunnel like this. indeed, captain. i'm quite at a loss. [fiery noise] get gone. disappeared. astonishing that anything of that bulk could move so rapidly. these walls are hot. indeed. this tunnel was cut within the last two minutes. you all right, captain? yes. perfectly. did you see it? yes. where does the tunnel go? readings indicate a maze of tunnels in that direction. did you shoot at it? yes. we took a bite out of it. not animal tissue. what is it? closest approximation i could come to would be fibrous asbestos, a mineral, captain. then your guess was right. it would seem so. silicon-based. summation. we are dealing with a silicon creature of the deep rocks, capable of moving through solid rock as easily as we move through the air. that explains the tunnels. this creature's body secretes an extremely powerful corrosive. powerful enough to dissolve the door of the reactor chamber. and it explains the murdered men. it's definitely phaser resistant. we had our weapons set for silicon and on full power, yet we only damaged it. it still lives. meaning it's impossible to kill? no. no, it might require amassed phasers. or a single phaser with much longer contact. commander... pass this on to your men -- we knew it was a killer. now it's wounded... probably in pain somewhere back there. there's nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal. commander giotto. instruct your men to concentrate the search in this sector. remind them the creature is wounded. aye, aye, sir. what is it, spock? i've run a complete check on all life forms, radius 100 miles. i've located all our men, and i've located one creature moving rapidly through native rock, bearing 201. and that is all. one creature in 100 miles? exactly. captain, there are literally thousands of these tunnels in this general area alone, far too many to be cut by the one creature in an ordinary lifetime. then we're dealing with more than one creature, despite your tricorder readings, or we have a creature with an extremely long life span. or it's the last of a race of creatures which made these tunnels. if it is the only survivor of a dead race, to kill it would be a crime against science. mr. spock... our mission is to protect this colony, to get the pergium moving again. this is not a zoological expedition. maintain a constant reading on the creature. if we have to, we'll use phasers to cut our own tunnels. we'll try to surround it. i'm sorry, mr. spock, but i'm afraid the creature must die. i see no alternative myself, captain. it merely seems a pity. the search team is gathering in the main tunnel. good. so it is wounded... and therefore twice as dangerous. stay in pairs. if you see it, concentrate your phaser fire at what appears to be its head. concentrate it. maintain it. it is definitely resistant, but it can be hurt, and thus it can be killed. gentlemen, if you'll examine your charts. i last located the creature in the area marked attit-26 moving in bearing 201. this particular group will move out beyond that area in all directions to surround it, possibly capture it. your orders are shoot to kill. protect yourself at all times. commander giotto, disperse your search parties. aye, aye, sir. louis, vinzi, take your men out. mr. spock. capture it? i don't recall giving any such order. you did not. i thought, if the opportunity arose-- i will lose no more men. the creature will be killed on sight. that's the end of it. very well, sir. mr. spock. i want you to assist scotty in maintaining that make shift circulating pump. i--i beg your pardon, sir? you heard me. it's vital that we keep that reactor in operation. your scientific knowledge -- is not needed there, sir. mr. scott has far more knowledge of nuclear reactors than i. you're aware of that. mr. spock, you are second in command. this hunt will be dangerous. either one of us alone is expendable. both are not. captain, there are approximately 100 of us engaged in this search against one creature. the odds against you and i both being killed are 2,228.7 to 1. 2,228.7 to 1? those are pretty good odds, mr. spock. and they are of course accurate, captain. of course. well, i hate to use the word, but logically, with those kind of odds, you might as well stay. but please stay out of trouble, mr. spock. that is always my intention, captain. [beep beep] kirk here. scotty here, captain. my brilliant improvisation just gave up the ghost. he couldn't stand the strain. can you fix it again? negative, captain. it's gone for good. start evacuation of all colonists to the enterprise. not all, captain. i and my key personnel are staying. we'll be down to join you. we haven't enough phasers for you. we'll use clubs. we won't run away. we're staying. good. get everybody else aboard the enterprise. the fewer people down here, the longer we can hold out. how much longer, scotty? the reactor goes critical in 10 hours unless you find the mechanism. we'll do our best. start feeding us constant status reports. vanderberg, you and your crew assemble at level 23, checkpoint tiger. kirk out. team up with enterprise personnel. they're better armed than you. always keep someone in sight. vanderberg, take two men and enter that tunnel. rendezvous with commander giotto. appel and the rest, go through there. tie up with lieutenant osborne's detail. mr. spock and i will control the operation from a central point. that's all. mr. spock? captain, we are being watched. are you sure? intuition? no, sir. we're being watched. [electronic tone] captain. fresh readings within the hour in each of these tunnels. chart says both of these tunnels converge a few thousand yards further. you go left. i'll go right. should we separate? two tunnels, two of us. we separate. mr. spock. yes, captain. i've found a whole layer of these silicon nodules of yours, hundreds of them. [spock] indeed? i find that most illuminating, captain. be absolutely certain you do not damage any of them. explain. only a theory i have. [rumbling] captain? [spock] are you all right? jim? jim! yes, mr. spock. all right. we...seem to have had a cave-in. i could phaser you out. [kirk] no, you better not. any disturbance might bring down the rest. besides, it isn't necessary. the chart said the tunnels meet further on. very well, but i find it extremely disquieting that your roof chose that particular moment to collapse. please proceed with extreme caution. i shall quicken my pace. very well, mr. spock. i'll meet you at the other end-- [rumbling] [beep beep] kirk here. captain, i just read some fresh signs. the creature is in this area. i'll take a life form reading. it's not necessary, mr. spock. i know exactly where the creature is. where, captain? 10 feet away from me. kill it, captain, quickly. it's not making any threatening moves, spock. you don't dare take the chance. kill it. i thought you wanted it kept alive, captured if possible. jim, your life is in danger. you can't take the risk. it seems to be waiting. i remind you it's a proven killer. i'm on my way. spock out. well... what do we do, just...talk it over? well, you can be hurt, can't you? we just sit here? it's your move. no, no! don't shoot. come on over, mr. spock. fascinating. he's made no moves against you. no. it seems to be waiting. i tried talking to it, but no response. yes... they're all through here. all over the place. thousands of them. yes, i see. it means something to you? possibly the answer, captain, but i'm not certain. captain, you are aware of the vulcan technique of the joining of two minds. you think you can get through to that thing? possible. mr. spock... i know it's a... terrible personal lowering of mental barriers... but if there's a chance... i'll try. aah! pain! pain! pain! that's all i got, captain... waves and waves of searing pain. it's in agony. ''no kill i.'' what is that, a plea for us not to kill it, or a promise that it won't kill us? i don't know, captain. evidently, it gained an immediate knowledge of us from its empathy with me. in my brief contact with the creature's mind, i discovered it is a highly intelligent, extremely sophisticated animal... in great pain, of course, because of its wound, but not reacting at all like a wounded creature. it calls itself a horta. a horta. a horta! mr. spock, we need that retardation mechanism. you must reestablish communications with it. captain, it has no reason to give us the device, and apparently every reason for wishing us off this planet. i'm aware of that. if we could only win its... confidence. dr. mccoy, this is captain kirk. [mccoy] yes, captain? grab your medical kit and come down here on the double. is somebody injured? what happened? never mind. just come down to the 23rd level. you'll be led to us by tricorder readings. jim, i remind you that this is a silicon-based form of life. dr. mccoy's medical knowledge will be useless. he's a healer, let him heal. mr. spock, you must reestablish communications. i want to know why it suddenly took to murder. to obtain that kind of communication, captain, it will be necessary to touch it. we have seen how the creature destroys. lieutenant commander giotto. giotto here, captain. are you all right? perfectly all right. where are you? we're at the end of the tunnel. a mr. vanderberg and his men are here, and they're pretty ugly. shall i let them through? under no circumstances allow them in here yet. the minute doc mccoy gets there, send him through. aye, aye, sir. pity! the thousands... devils! eternity ends... the chamber of the ages... the altar of tomorrow! [spock] murderers! stop them! kill! strike back! monsters! what in the name of... what is spock doing? it's wounded--badly. you've got to help it. help that? go take a look. [spock] the end of life... murderers. you can't be serious. that thing is virtually made out of stone! help it. treat it. i'm a doctor, not a bricklayer. you're a healer. there's a patient. that's an order. mr. spock... tell it we're trying to help. the mechanism. understood. is the end of life... eternity stops... go out... into the tunnel. to the chamber... of the ages. cry... for the children. walk...carefully... in the vault of tomorrow. [sobbing] sorrow...for the murdered children. the thing you search for is there. go. go. sadness. sadness... for the end of things. go... into the tunnel. there is a passage way. quickly, quickly. the captain said for you to wait here, and here is where you'll wait. that murdering monster's in there. we're going to kill it. you're going to stay here. that's right, lieutenant. just beam it down to me immediately, and never mind what i want it for. i just want it! now move! it is time... to sleep. it is over. failure. the murderers... have won. death is welcome. let it end... here. mr. spock... mr. spock... spock... spock... come out of it. i found the unit in there. it's in pretty good shape. i also found about a million of these... silicon nodules. they're eggs, aren't they? yes, captain, eggs... and about to hatch. miners must have broken into the hatchery. their operations destroyed thousands. no wonder. there. they're coming. all right! all right, let's go! come on. how are you doing, doc? i'll let you know. [running footsteps] all right, let's get them! don't fire. first man that fires is dead. that thing has killed 50 of my men. you've killed thousands of her children. what? those round silicon nodules you've been collecting and destroying? they're her eggs. tell them, mr. spock. there have been many generations of horta on this planet. every 50,000 years, the entire race dies, all but one, like this one, but the eggs live. she cares for them... protects them. and when they hatch, she is the mother to them, thousands of them. this creature here is the mother of her race. the horta is intelligent... peaceful... mild. she had no objection to sharing this planet with you, till you broke into her nursery and started destroying her eggs. then she fought back the only way she knew how, as any mother would when her children are in danger. we didn't know. how could we? you mean, if these eggs hatch, thousands of those things will be crawling around down here? this is where they live. they digest rock. they tunnel for nourishment. and they are the most inoffensive of creatures. they harbor no ill will. look, we have pergium to deliver. yes, i know. here's your circulating pump. you've complained this planet is a mineralogical treasure house if you had the equipment to get at it. the horta moves through rock the way we move through air, leaving tunnels. the greatest natural miners in the universe. it seems to me we could make an agreement, reach a modus vivendi. they tunnel. you collect and process, and your process operation would be a thousand times more profitable. it sounds all right if it will work. except for one thing. the horta is badly wounded. it may die. it won't die! i'm beginning to think i can cure a rainy day. can you help it? help it? i cured it. how? i had the ship beam down 100 pounds of that thermal concrete we use to build emergency shelters. it's mostly silicon. i just troweled it into the wound. it'll act like a bandage until it heals. take a look. it's as good as new. you'll have to get in touch with the horta again. tell her our proposition. she and her children can tunnel. our people will remove the minerals. each side leaves the other alone. think she'll go for it? it seems logical, captain. the horta has a very logical mind. and after close association with humans, i find that curiously refreshing. ship ready to leave orbit, captain. course laid in. very good, mr. spock. chief engineer vanderberg standing by on channel 1. fine. yes, chief. kirk here. just wanted to tell you the eggs are hatching. first thing the little devils do is start to tunnel. we've already hit huge new pergium deposits. i'm afraid to tell you how much gold, platinum, and rare ores we've uncovered. i'm delighted to hear that, chief. once mother horta tells her kids what to look for, you'll all be embarrassingly rich. the horta aren't so bad once you're used to their appearance. that's about it, kirk. thanks for everything. our pleasure, chief. kirk out. curious. what chief vanderberg said about the horta is exactly what the mother horta said to me. she found humanoid appearance revolting, but she thought she could get used to it. oh, she did, did she? did she happen to make any comment about those ears? not specifically. but i did get the distinct impression she found them the most attractive human characteristic of all. i couldn't bear to tell her that only i have-- she really liked those ears? captain, the horta is a remarkably intelligent and sensitive creature with impeccable taste. because she approved of you. really, captain, my modesty... does not bear close examination, mr. spock. i suspect you're becoming more and more human all the time. you... captain, i see no reason to stand here and be insulted. ahead, warp factor 2."

look, mr wedge, we don't have that kind of gang, we're not a bunch of hoods, -we've got a basketball team. -why you carry a knife benji? well it's only a boy scout knife, they sell them all over. i just use it for, you know... who you think you're kidding? look, who sides you are? oh no, i didn't stick kenny, somebody else did. i swear i didn't kill him. i’m not making accusations, kid, that's the prosecution's job, sit down, sit down, now i’m gonna go over this thing the way the police have got it, and then you tell me where they're wrong, huh? at 10 minutes to midnight on october 9th you and two other guys, were walking down thurman street, you just come out of a movie house, kenny archer just come out of an apartment building, in thurmond and avenue sea you bumped into each other, there was some horse play but the next thing that happened, you and the other two guys were running away and kenny, fell to the sidewalk and started crawling toward the stoop of a house, now there were two people sitting on the steps of that building, they saw you running away and they saw kenny die right in front of them, then a half an hour later, the cops picked you up in your old man's store, and you still had the knife in your pocket. it wasn't me, the rest of that stuff it's true, -but i didn't hurt kenny. -all right, who are the other two guys? -i don't know. -son't give me that! i tell you i don't know, they came out of that movie the same time i did, but i never saw him before, one of them must have done it, when i saw kenny was hurt i ran away, that's how it was. but you had the knife. but i didn't use it. look kid, that knife is exhibit a, you know what that means? -leave me alone. -the witnesses saw you're holding... you're not here to help me. yes, i am kid, the only way you can be help, now you listen to me and do what i tell you, i want you to plead guilty, you understand? that's the only thing you can do, if i put this case in front of a jury, you're gonna spend the rest of your life in a cage, you plead gilly the judge might give you a break. i won't do it, i am innocent and i ain't gonna stay in jail for something i didn't do. i am talking sense to you, now listen to me... i’m trying to help you son! i’m not your son, i got a father. let me out of here, will ya? you'd better talk some sense into him, i told him if he'd plead guilty in a second degree, the judge is bound to be lenient. but then he goes to jail for something he didn't do. look mr marino, because you're his father, doesn't give you the right to ignore the facts. the facts are wrong, i know, you don't like to lose cases, if my boy pleads guilty you lose nothing your records is still good. all right, if you feel that way about it, if you think that's my reason get yourself another lawyer. please please i don't know what i’m saying, -i don't know anything about the law. -well i do, and i know this much mr marino, your faith in your kid is very commendable but it's no defense in the courtroom, all right, we plead not guilty, i’ll do what i can to make it stick. why shouldn't it? it's the truth? -why shouldn't it stick? -because the prosecution has got witnesses. mr dankers you were present at the time of kenneth archer slang, isn't that so? that's right. would you please describe what happened. well, i was sitting on the stoop, getting a breath, then the kids come running up the street, i didn't pay no attention until they start fooling around, next thing i know, one of them drops to the sidewalk, and the rest of them run away, then the kid crawls up the stoop, only he dies before he gets there. how far away from the boys were you when the scuffle occurred? not, not far, maybe 40 or 50 feet. i see, close enough for you to get a look at that. i only saw one of them good. there's a street lamp near the apartment building isn't there? -yeah. -so you didn't have any trouble seeing the boy who stabbed kenneth archer? i didn't see the actual stabbing, but i saw the boy run away with a knife in his hands. do you see that boy in this courtroom now mr dankers? yeah i see him, it's that one over there. mrs archer, i’m i’m very sorry i’ll try to be as brief as possible, but i must ask you these questions, you said that kenneth was a good son. yes, yes, he was very good. all right. he was always helping me around the house. -did he ever get into any trouble? -no, never, never. -was he ever picked up by the police? -no. no, never before. did he ever get into any fights, with other boys? all right mrs archer, would counsil care to cross-examine? well what do you say benji? oh, if i could work miracles i’d work one, you can get life, even if you got out on parole in 20 years you know what should be worth, are you gonna plead gilty? benji will you please plead gilly? no, i didn't do it. i did it. not going so well is it? of course it's not going so well, i wish i could figure out some way to get that old man on the stand, he's got a fanatical faith in that kid of his that might just rub off on the jury, do you think he's innocent? my question is immaterial irrelevant and it's niot your business. you do not look at all well, you don't look at all well, and i think when this is over you ought to see a doctor. you know that's not a bad idea, you remember doc uh, hagerty? but he's not the kind of doctor i mean, -i mean a good all-around gp. -yeah yeah. i’m going out, i’ll be at the dugan hospital if anybody wants me. i don't understand you vernon you say the police already examined the boy's knife -for blood stains using the standard benzedrine test. -that's right, they didn't find anything so they claimed that the kid had wiped the blade clean, but you told me one time there was some kind of a test that's even more sensitive. there is, it's called a reduced phenolphthalein test. it's a lot more sensitive in my opinion but it's not universally accepted. yeah but could you make that test now? it's all right with me just give me the boy's knife. i can't do that, it's court property, but could, could you demonstrate the test forming using another knife, -that's just like. -i suppose so. -good, i picked this up on the way over it's the same type that benji marino carried, pretty cheap too 98 cents. the cheaper the better. well first we'll put some whole blood on the blade, and we'll wipe off all traces of the blood, yeah, take a look, see any stains? clean as a whistle. now we'll try it on the solution, and the blade may look clean but, with a cheap knife the blade metal is usually porous, so it retains microscopic quantities of the blood. changes color and gets dark, huh? if the solution changes color, verny, you can be sure there was blood on the blade, there's only one drawback. what's that? this test doesn't prove whose blood was on the knife, if your boy cut his own finger it'll work just the same, he'll look just as guilty. -oh benji... -what's the words? you listen to me and listen carefully, i thought of something that might just save you it's a test, now this is a chemical test that can determine, whether or not there's ever been blood on your knife, now i’m going to make that test in court tomorrow and if it's negative, the jury will know that you didn't kill kenny archer. no, i don't understand that kind of stuff. i’m not asking you to understand anything, but if you stab that kid, a jug, full of chemical is going to turn dark and you can kiss your freedom goodbye, there¡s something else, if you ever cut anybody with that knife, the chemical is going to turn dark too, now you tell me something and i want you to tell me the truth, has there ever been blood on that knife? i told you i never cut one. -do you understand my question? i want to know if there's ever been blood of any kind on a knife. no, -i was brand new i never cut nothing. -you sure? you never cut your own finger? i said it was clean. mr wikers if the prosecution has no further witnesses, do you wish to make your summation? -yes your honor. -your honor... -yes mr wedge? something has occurred which i consider to be a paramount importance to this case, i asked the court's permission to introduce new evidence for the defense. objection, the defense has had sufficient time for the introduction of evidence, i suggest that this is a delaying tactic. -what sort of evidence mr wedge? -this is a demonstration your honor, which in my opinion will clearly establish the guilt or innocence of my client. if mr wedge would like a postponement... i don't want a postponement i want to make this demonstration if i may describe it. very well council you may proceed, what is this mr wedge? your honor this is a chemical solution, specifically formulated for the detection of blood stains, ladies and gentlemen, exhibit a in this case is a knife, the knife which presumably killed kenneth archer, now this knife, was found in the possession of benji marino on the night of the sleigh, however not one word of testimony has been produced, in this court concerning the vital factor of blood, now this knife has not left the possession of this court since my client's arrest, however this clean shiny blade can still, tell a story of guilt or innocence, because, as any biochemist knows, there is one infallible test, which can determine whether an object of such porous metal, has ever tasted even one drop of blood, your honor it is my intention to prove once and for all, whether i’m defending a boy falsely accused or a lying murderer, i intend to dip the blade of this knife into a solution of reduced phenothalene, a reduced phenythaline is the most sensitive of all blood detection chemicals, -if... -one moment mr wedge, -you say that beaker contains what kind of solution? -reduced phenolphthalein. and how can we be certain that it contains this chemical? could be lemonade for all that we know. i have a statement from dr haggerty of the dugan hospital. or if you plan to produce expertise... i plan only to make this test mr wickers. your honor objection. state your objection, council. defense is acting improperly, the police laboratory has already made the standard test, on the weapon and has found no blood stains on the blade, the prosecution has stated that the knife was obviously wiped clean. your honor the sensitivity of this test... no time during this trial as the prosecution denied, the absence of blood stains on benjamin marino’s knife, now mr wedge is trying to demonstrate something we already know, using a test which is not accepted as standard laboratory procedure, i suggest that the so-called demonstration is nothing but pure theatrics, but with an intention to mislead, and to confuse the jury. mr wedge, the court must agree with the prosecution, you are not an expert in forensic chemistry, the corroboration of the police laboratory report, is gratuitous evidence, must be considered inadmissible. your honor my client is willing to have me make this test, -the boy is aware of the chance he's taking. -i’m sorry, this demonstration is improper, objection is sustained, you may not make the test mr wedge. mr wedge, if you please make your summation to the jury. i believe that benji marino is innocent, i believe he's innocent because of a test that i was not permitted to make, this boy knew that if the results of the test were negative, he would be condemned to prison for the rest of his life, and no guilty person would have allowed it. the former the jury please rise, has the jury reached its verdict? we have, your honor. please read it to the court. we find the defendant not guilty. you can wait right here in the judge's chamber, your attorney will be with you in a moment. bless you for what you did mr wedge. i didn't come here to be congratulated i wanted to see you both for another reason, the prosecuting attorney was right mr marino, what i did out there was theatrics, pure theatrics. i don't understand. i mean, i didn't want to make that test, i would have had to if he hadn't objected but that's a chance i took. you didn't want to? look, if this stuff had turned dark it would have been all over for your boy, i was counting on the prosecutor's objection, i figured on it, i also figured that the jury would be impressed in the right way, and that's all i could hope for. the knife would have been all right, i know it would. how do you know mr marino? because you've got faith? yes. well in that case there's only one way we can find out, isn't there? we'll make the test now for our own sakes. why? what difference does it make now? because i want to know, that's why. here, make it test, make your test now mr wedge. those of you with a passion for peripheral detail, will be interested in knowing, that the actual killers in this case were ultimately brought to justice, as for this next detail, it is a television commercial, an item for which i have a passion, frankly i like them because i feel so wonderful when they're over, which is when i shall next see you. i hope you have enjoyed singing along with hitch, it is the best way i know to indulge in a community sing, without actually having to rub elbows with one's neighbors, next week we should be back myself and all the gang, until then good night."
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"(""alfred hitchcock"" theme music) - good evening. please do not be alarmed. this is not a remote broadcast. i'm still very much with you. actually, this is from my collection of ancient weapons. in the days of the bow and arrow, this could strike with a force of a machine gun. furthermore, instead of the bothersome rattle of explosions, a burst of shots from this instrument was accompanied by sweet music, a feature which was undoubtedly appreciated by the victims. actually, you will find quite a number of these about today. most of them are in our larger symphony orchestras. they help keep the conductors from becoming obstreperous. with that thought in my mind, i can't help but turn to our sponsor, that dear person would like to spend the next minute talking about himself. this will be followed by power of attorney, a drama about a woman and her devoted companion and about a man who helped her with her investments, and so in just one lamentable minute, power of attorney. (suspenseful music) - [man] it was so unexpected. - it isn't true. - [man] i'm afraid so. - but you told me, you told me only yesterday that those stocks were worth $10,000. - [man] only this morning. - where are you going? - [man] back to the office. - that was shirley's college money that i gave you. - i invested $5000 of my own. - [woman] will you be coming back at dinner? - you can't feel like cooking for me after what's happened. - oh darling. it isn't your fault. it's just rotten luck, that's all. - i'll be back, at eight on the button. - [officer] what time did his hotel say he checked out? - [woman] six o'clock. - [officer] and he was supposed to be here at eight? - he told me that he was in love with me. he said that he wanted to marry me. he said he was gonna triple my $10,000 stock in three months. - [officer] where did you meet this wilford james, mrs. norton? - on a plane coming back from jamaica. he came over and sat down beside me and began feeding me that line. - salzburg is a charming town. i was there last in '59. - we go every year for the festival. - oh, i've never been for the festival. - [old woman] it's the best time. - cigarette? - no. agatha doesn't smoke. - agatha, you're agatha? agatha what? - tomlin. i'm mary caulfield. - james jarvis. - how do you do? - how do you do? and how do you do? - how do you do? (suspenseful music) - after i passed the bar examination, i in my home town in competition with my father. he was actually very proud. married my childhood sweetheart, and i thought, boy, james jarvis, you have really settled down. and then my darling wife died in childbirth. after that i couldn't stay in england any longer. so i immigrated to america, came to new york, started to fool around the stock market. you know it seems i found my niche, it's fascinating. do you know anything about stocks and shares, mrs. caulfield? - not a thing. - miss tomlin? you a financial wizard? - hardly. (james chuckles) - my lawyer takes care of everything. i don't want to know about numbers and contracts. handling money is a man's business. (glass clinks) (dramatic music) i told you she'd be late. - she's always late. - who's always late? - my great-niece. she was to meet us here. - which way are you going? we could share a cab. - we live at the golden angel hotel. - you wanna talk about coincidences, that's where i'm staying this trip. what about that. here, give me your tags, i'll get the luggage. - eileen! - aunt m! - darling. - aunt m, i'm sorry we're late. it wasn't our fault, the traffic was backed up for miles. ask robert, bumper to bumper. - robert. - hello, mrs. caulfield. - mr. jarvis, this is my great-niece, eileen harris. robert reeves. we're gonna give mr. jarvis a ride to the hotel. - will there be room in the car? - robert brought his father's car. - robert. - give me your things and i'll get your bags. - that's all right, i have them right here. - are we ready? then let's go. - oh, miss tomlin, look here. let me take that. and that one's too heavy for you, dear. see you later. porter. this lot. (suspenseful music) - [clerk] well, well, good afternoon, mrs. caulfield. welcome home. and how was salzburg? - [mary] wonderful as always. anything exciting happen while we were away? - [clerk] not a thing. welcome home, miss tomlin. - thank you. - no, no, no, not all of those are mine this time. the bottom bag belongs to mr. jarvis. you better check in, mr. jarvis, they were about to put you in with us. - i wasn't gonna say a word. (chuckles) yes, i have a reservation, mr. james jarvis. - [clerk] jarvis? - james jarvis. - [clerk] well i'm sorry, there's nothing here under that name. - i called from chicago four days ago. i called about noon. - oh, well it's obviously our mistake. the only thing i have right at this minute is a single over the pool. - how would i like a single over the pool? - you wouldn't. put him in the rear where we are where it's quiet. - oh yes, i'll have a room on the fourth floor sometime after three. he's not out of there yet, but he's checking out today. - what time is it now? - [clerk] it's 1:30. - i'll wait for it. - come and have a cup of tea with us. - no thank you, but that's not necessary. - he'll be with us. - fine. leave mr. jarvis' bags. i'll have them sent up, sir. - thank you. the house in jamaica was just too much trouble. i never used it, oh, maybe a couple of times a year. i just have the apartment in rome now. i suppose i ought to have something in new york. - i used to have a house in new york, but i really prefer living in a hotel. oh that's sweet. greetings from mr. barton. - birthday, aunt m. - i'll talk to him. (phone rings) - hello? it's for you, your room is ready. - hello? thank you. yes, i'll go right up. 405, that's not too far away, is it, mary? - one flight up, two doors down. - oh, we're neighbors. (chuckles) - you'll have dinner with us when we get organized? - well, until then, why don't i invite you to dinner somewhere tonight? - yes. - you, agatha? eileen and robert? - we have other plans. - well, i'll pick you and agatha up about eight o'clock? - we'll have a drink here? - great, see you later. - [agatha] goodbye. - are you always this quiet? - always. well, happy birthday and bon voyage. - merci. - alvederzane. - alvederzane. (laughs) - bye. - [mary] he's charming. - you think everyone's charming, aunt m. - isn't he, agatha? - not to me. (suspenseful music) - oh hello, is there a florist shop in the hotel? oh fine. yes, this is mr. jarvis in 405. i'd like to send a dozen ro, two dozen roses to 303. yes, one dozen for mrs. mary caulfield, and the other for miss agatha tomlin. fine, bye. mm, holding up pretty well for five days. - agatha changes the water every morning. and this morning she gave them a vitamin. - well, i'll buy you both some more. both of you. - you were telling us about the arlo trust company, mr. jarvis. - that tone mean you want me to shut up? or do you really want to hear - [agatha] it's your choice. - don't play games, agatha. - mystery maiden. - don't say that. just what she wants to hear. - i want to hear about the arlo trust company, the chance that comes once in five lifetimes. - go wash the dishes. - no, i'm serious. i really want to try and understand. - well, i have the opportunity of buying through a friend of mine, a very dear friend, who happens to be on the board of directors, as many shares in the arlo trust company as i can afford. they sell for $50 a share, but i can buy them for 30. he transfers them into my name, and then when the shares go on the market, i sell 'em and double my money. it's not quite as simple as that, but that's basically how it works. you know anybody who wants to double their money in one afternoon? - me. - oh, mary. - you better speak to mr. barton. - well, i would, i'd have to. i couldn't do anything without consulting him. he controls everything. oh, he's such a character, james. nearly 80, never married, but he's as sharp as a tack. - sharp as a tack. why don't you arrange a meeting between james and mr. barton, and let james explain it to mr. barton. - why i'd love to. - well, let's arrange for lunch tomorrow. i'll phone mr. barton right away. - oh, thank you. cigarette? - i don't smoke. - mr. thomas barton please. will you tell him mary caulfield phoned? hello, thomas? listening in on your answering service again. are you free for lunch tomorrow? wonderful. here, one o'clock. there's something i wanna talk to you about. how are you feeling? well, you go right to bed. goodnight. no sooner said than done. - speaking of bed. - really? - really. thank you for a delightful meal. - thank agatha. - oh, she's the hash slinger? (chuckles) it was beautiful. goodnight. - goodnight. - and goodnight to you, mary. (suspenseful music) (coughs) (dramatic music) - right on the button, stroke of one. (chuckles) - and voila. you know it's the first time in my life i've been punctual six times in a row? of course it may have something to do with the fact that i only live three minutes away. - our plans have changed, mr. jarvis. something awful has happened. - where's mary? - mary's all right. it's mr. barton, he's dead. his secretary found him this morning. he didn't go into his office. they found him in his bed. he hadn't been feeling well lately. he seems to have had some kind of a stroke, suffocated somehow. mary is very upset. - i'm sorry. - of course it couldn't mean anything to you, but mary and i were both very fond of him. - i know. i'm terribly sorry. - i'm sorry you didn't meet. you'd have liked each other. - don't you think that you should lie down? - no. - i'll go. - mr. barton would say we were irrational if he saw us behaving like this. agatha spent all morning fixing this lunch. we'll have it together. james. how, in an instant, flowers take on a new significance. they seem out of place here. they seem to belong to thomas, and the dead. - here, let me take them. - [mary] very fortunate for me that you're here, james. (suspenseful music) are you asleep? - no. - seven times eight is what? - 56. - 56. - carry the five. let's talk about it, agatha, chase it out in the open. i don't think i know enough about him. known him nearly three weeks, seen him every day. he's been an absolute miracle. i don't understand you, agatha. you think he's dishonest? you're such a suspicious old thing. i have to have somebody to do this. i have to have a new lawyer. i've already asked him to come down later to go over the things that mr. barton's secretary sent me. well, i certainly trust him much more than i do any of the men the bank sent me. and he's more attractive. i don't think you dislike james so much. i feel you like him more than you'll admit, even to yourself. ooh, sun's too bright. i thought so. (doorbell buzzes) i'll get it. come in, james. - here i am with my peruse-able cap on. i hear you've got something needs perusing. - james, agatha. agatha's on the patio trying to get some sun. it's the first time i've ever known her to want to get a tan. i don't know what's come over her. she's cut her beautiful hair. you better have a drink before you look at my affairs. it's amazing how confused i get in just a week. - afternoon, agatha. say, i like your hair, beautiful. (chuckles) you know, i think i'm making progress with agatha. almost got a smile out of her. now, where's all this legal confusion? - [mary] on my desk. - how did you convince agatha to let me have a look at this stuff? promise her a bushel of persimmons? - shh, she knows we're talking about her. - we're in here talking about you, agatha. boy that really is some shell. - much thinner than you think. - oh really? bark's worse than the bite? - much. she can have a night off anytime she wants it. - you wouldn't be jealous? - a little. - just a little? - ask her. maybe she'll stop complaining about you. it's what she really wants. (gentle music) - i was nursing mr. caulfield when he was in the hospital, and then when he left the hospital, mrs. to come and live at the house and look after him there. and then when he died, she was so upset. she couldn't bear to be alone. she gets morbidly depressed if things go wrong. that's against the law. - you won't tell anybody, will you? goodnight. (laughs) - goodnight, james. - goodnight, sleep well. - so? so? - so what? - did you have a good time? - nice enough. - [mary] what do you think? - about what? - [mary] about him. - he didn't try and kiss me. - is that good or bad? - not good. not bad, clever. we'll see. - 22% my dear lady. 22% richer than you were a week ago right here. - i don't understand it at all. - let me see it. - just one or two more papers to sign, then we can talk about something more interesting. - what are these now, james? - these give me what's called the power of attorney. - that i've heard of. but i'm not sure what it means. - tell mary what the power of attorney is, agatha. - it means that you give james the right to sign your name for you. - that you give me the right to make decisions for you if i can't get to you in time. mr. barton had it. it's the reason you were never troubled about anything. is there any more coffee, agatha? - yes, there is. - now, mary. right here. - eileen called this morning. she wants to know if i'm going to be able to help her visit robert. she wants to leave within the next three weeks. - and there. well, the way arlo trust is going right now, pretty soon you'll be able to buy germany. there we are. safe as safe can be. - [agatha] coffee, mary? - not for me, keeps me awake. i'm exhausted, going straight to bed. goodnight. - goodnight, mary. sleep tight. (laughs) - night. - night. - you approve? - i approve. (smacks) (dramatic music) (smacks) - don't you ever do that again. - into each life some rain must fall. and in the center of every hour of television, we must have a station break, after which, we shall continue the story of mary, agatha, and their friend, mr. jarvis. - where's mary? - in the sun room. - you better fix us a drink. better fix us all a drink. arlo trust has declared bankruptcy. - what does that mean? - means that everything we've invested in it is gone. - how much of my money did you invest in it, james? - yesterday it was selling for $75 a share. now they can't give it away. - how much? - i invested every penny you had in your savings. - my savings? but that's all excuse me. - it was so unexpected. - i'd better go to her. - yes. - come for breakfast in the morning. (suspenseful music) - i don't know how i can tell any of them. peter and his wife live on the money i send them every month. eileen is counting on me to pay her way to see robert. - they've all lived off you for years. let them help you now. - rich aunt m. if rich aunt m spends any of the money in her checking account, there won't be enough left to pay the hotel bill this month. - mary, i have $1000 in the bank. it wasn't his fault. - be so much easier if it were. - i thought he was coming down to breakfast. - he said he was. 405 please. (phone rings) - [james] hello? oh hello, agatha. - james, breakfast will be ready in a minute. - [james] oh sweetheart, something's come up and i can't make it. i've got to get down to the office. - james, i have $1000 in the bank. mary won't take it, if it'd be any help. - well, yes it might help me get back on my feet. - you're welcome to it. - could you have it about noon? - yes, i have to go out shopping anyway. james, could we rent a car and drive up the coast tomorrow? mary has to get out of this apartment. - i'll arrange the day that way. - good, see you at lunch then. - about one? - yes, goodbye. - bye. yeah, would you get me 626-0025. oh hello, reservations please. this is mr. jarvis smith. i have a reservation on the 11:15 flight to mexico city this morning, but something's come up and i have to cancel that. could you manage me one say in the late afternoon? yeah, 6:15 would be fine, fine. oh, fella, first class, huh? yeah, great. all right. front desk? yes, this is mr. james jarvis in 405. would you ask the cashier to make out my bill up to date? yeah, i'll drop in sometime this afternoon and pay it off. fine. bye bye. - i'm going to the market. do you want anything? - my great-grandfather, my grandfather, my father worked their entire lives to save that money. and now it's gone in one afternoon. (melancholy music) where are you going? - [agatha] to the market. - market. market to buy a fat pig. - [agatha] i'll be back in 1/2 an hour. - home again, home again, jiggity jig. (melancholy music) hello, eileen. this is your aunt m. eileen, i'm not going to be able to help you go to germany. something drastic has happened. there was some stock. arlo trust company. i had all of my money invested in them. and now it's gone. no dear, no, i'm quite all right. i just didn't want you to go on counting on me. goodbye, eileen. (classical piano music) (phone rings) - any messages? - only a couple of circulars. miss tomlin, we'll all miss mr. jarvis. - miss him? - [clerk] he's checking out this afternoon. very nice man. - oh yes, today's thursday, isn't it? yes, he told me. i'd forgotten. (suspenseful music) - are you all right, miss tomlin? - yes. yes. (classical piano music) - [operator] may i help you? - 405 please. - [operator] i'm sorry, mr. jarvis doesn't answer. would you like to have him paged? - yes, page him please. - [operator] mr. james jarvis. phone call for mr. james jarvis. i'm sorry, mr. jarvis is not in the hotel. would you like to leave a message? - yes, tell him that agatha tomlin called. mary? mary, are you asleep? (dramatic music) (doorbell buzzes) - how is she? - what do you mean? - well, she called me an hour ago. she scared me to death. she was crying, saying something about she'd lost all her money. is that true? - she's sleeping. yes. yes, it is true. - well, what happened? she said something about the arlo trust company. so i went to see robert's lawyer to talk to him about it, and he never heard of it. so he phoned his broker, who vaguely remembered an arlo trust company that went bankrupt in chicago a few years ago. how much did she invest? - i don't know. - you know to the penny how much. you invested in it too. you've been swindled. - yes, i'm afraid so. - agatha, we'll have to call the police. - as soon as your aunt wakes up, i'll talk to her about that. - well, if she wants to talk to robert's lawyer, i can get him on the phone. evans is his name - i think. - spannis worthy evans in brentwood. i have to go downtown now to get my passport, but i'll be back before in case you need me for anything. - [agatha] thank you. - be sure and let me know what the police say. - [agatha] yes, i will. - bye, have aunt m call me tonight. - [agatha] yes, goodbye. (dramatic music) - agatha. bagatha. (chuckles) - [operator] guest please? - 303. (phone rings) - agatha, bagatha. (phone rings) - hello? - oh, agatha? i just got in. what are you doing? - just sitting here, waiting for you to return my call. where are you? - oh, in my room, lying down on the bed. - [agatha] did you go to the office? - sure. - [agatha] are you able to drive mary and me up the coast tomorrow? - mm hm, sure am. - i thought if we started about 10 in the morning that we'd be able to have lunch on the pier at santa barbara. - great. - i went to the bank and i drew out the money. i have $1200 for you. - i'll pay you back just as soon as i can. - why don't you come down here right now. mary would like to talk to you. - how is she? - [agatha] she's thoroughly disenchanted with stocks. - from well i imagine. and with me. - no, she does not blame you, james, and besides, it's not such a disaster since the morning's mail. i was worried about her before. hello? are you there? - oh yes, i was just lighting a cigarette. good news? - i'd say so. you know that she lost her only brother in texas last year. oh i'm sure she's mentioned it to you. well, this morning, such luck. there was a letter, a legal sort of a thing, which neither one of us can decipher, but it's plain that she's inherited the major part of his estate. arlo trust can be forgotten, and she'd like you to be kind enough to come down and explain it to her. - of course. - but don't you dare mention stocks to her. she says all she wants to do is put the money in the bank and live off the interest. - must be a sizeable sum. - oh much more than we ever dreamed of. we're expecting you. - i'll be right down. bye. (suspenseful music) (doorbell buzzes) ♪ it was a lover and his lass ♪ ♪ with a hey and a hey and a hey ♪ - keep your voice down. mary's resting. i'll wake her up in a few minutes. she didn't sleep well last night. - good morning. it is still morning, isn't it? - i think so. would you like some coffee? - no thank you, ma'am. - james, i'm so glad you're here. it was such an awful night. i was so worried about mary all day yesterday, and i found something that scared me. i didn't know what to do about it. - and what's that? - look at this. i didn't know she had a gun in the house. i found it in her bedroom. it's loaded. she was so despondent that i was afraid of what she would do. of course the morning mail was a godsend. oh i hate those things. get rid of it, james, get it, get it out of the house. take it away. no, don't point it! put it in your pocket. - there (chuckles) i'll look after you. - mary, are you awake? james is here. she's mumbling something. i'll get her some coffee. meanwhile, you two can peruse, as you say, that letter. - mary, mary, quite contrary. how does your garden grow? hey, agatha? agatha? what are you doing, you silly baby? oh, i see you. agatha, what you do that for? (laughs) mary? - hello, the police, get the police. get somebody up here right away, someone's been shot. - agatha! - 303. - agatha! - hurry! - agatha, open up, will you? (pounds) agatha, what are you doing? agatha! open the door, will ya? let me out of here. agatha, let me out of here! agatha! (glass shatters) agatha! agatha, let me out! (gunshots) - he's in the sunroom. be careful, he's got a gun. (gunshot) (dishes shatter) - why would he kill mrs. caulfield? - i don't know. i heard them arguing about some kind of business. she said that she wanted to go to the police about something that he didn't want investigated. some kind of stocks. something called the arlo trust company. (dramatic music) - well, that's the way the body bounces. however, i feel compelled to say that the manner which mary chose to leave this veil of tears is not the one to solve one's problems. in short, we do not recommend suicide as a way of life. that is all the story we have for tonight. some miscellaneous items follow. i found a new use for my harp. if you like sliced, homemade bread, just push the loaves through the harp before baking.

brother he insists on coming home late at night and making a great deal of noise in the dark before he tumbles into bed i thought that this orthopedic mattress would be precisely what he needs to cure him of that bothersome habit our story does not concern a bed like this but it does take place in a sleepy little town apparently nothing much ever happens in lindvale but i have the uneasy feeling that if we watch closely something will in case you're doing the driving linvale lies just on the other side of this one-minute billboard [music] ah [music] hey [music] [music] hey mister you see flipper i think he came back here why my cat i'm looking for him well look somewhere else but he came around the side of your house well he was trespassing just like you a take off you hear what i said [music] sheriff's office oh i'd like to speak to the sheriff please uh well i'm sorry ma'am he's all tied up right now well when can i talk to her it's rather urgent it's urgent yes so if you could have him get in touch with me as soon as possible do you want to hold on while i just get a pencil yeah do you uh just uh want to give me your name and address it's mrs logan 74 walnut lane yes ma'am i'll give you the sheriff your message tell him it's important all right how's that sharon henry you're a regular wizard with a pair of scissors thanks how about some half tonic hmm what do you got sweet lilac evergreen or a wild tiger it's that green bottle over there it's it's pretty potent stuff sure tell me he goes over big with the ladies maybe i better leave well enough alone morning sheriff i just got a phone call who's mine in the store well i just got a phone call from a lady named logan she says that she has to talk to you she says it's urgent urgent last time i saw that word was a crossword puzzle but that's what she said probably some old spencer with a cat up a tree is that uh mrs logan up on walnut lane yeah 74 will not rain that's no spencer henry she's a widow heard she moved into the archer house a couple of months ago oh is that the one yeah i've seen her around town she's kind of pretty well maybe his fate ben you and a good-looking woman like that something might develop sure all right i'll take a ride out there well you don't have to see a band always give her a call unless maybe i've wet your appetite look at that charlie we got a barber who's a regular cupid hey mister you seen a cat why are you missing one uh-huh i think you ran away well that's too bad you're the sheriff aren't you that's right well maybe you can find him his name's flipper he's sort of gray i'll keep an eye peeled uh yes uh sheriff whister ma'am you call my office oh yes please come in i uh hope i didn't call you away from anything well it wasn't important what can i do for you well it it's something that might only be my imagination i almost feel like a fool bringing your way out here why don't you let me be the judge of that you see i'm new here and i don't want to get involved in something that's none of my business i've been debating with myself for the last three days but well i had to tell someone mind being a bit more specific well that's just it it's nothing i can quite put my finger on maybe you better come upstairs beg pardon i'll have to show you oh take a look through the window at the yard next door it's been going on like that for the past three days the drinking yes he doesn't seem to want to do anything he just hangs around the house all day that's harry jarvis isn't it you know him oh by sight i know most of the people in this town by sight he's in real estate never knew he was much of a drinker well he only started a few days ago after his wife disappeared i'm not quite sure i follow you oh it's a lot of little things ever since i moved in i used to hear them arguing they used to shout so loud they'd keep me awake and all of a sudden the argument stopped and you haven't seen her since no oh once she used to walk her dog in the mornings a little white mongrel named timmy but for the past three days she hasn't come out of the house when was the last time you saw her late friday afternoon she was out there sitting in a deck chair he was mowing the lawn once or twice i saw him look at her she didn't notice she was playing with the dog but you should have seen the expression on his face he looked like he wanted to kill her well mrs logan this is all pretty circumstantial maybe his wife is sick or she might be visiting relatives i can think of a hundred different explanations but why does he do his own laundry and why does he sit in the yard all day about eight years ago we had a homicide in lynn vale man got clubbed with a bottle in one of those taverns out by the highway that's just about it this is a peaceable town well i i told you it might only be my imagination but if you could have seen the way he looked at her well look there's no sense and i are going off half cut before we start assuming things why don't i do a little quiet checking would that make you feel better oh i think so good i'll give you a call tomorrow well i just as soon deal with mr jarvis himself if you don't mind i see where can i set up an appointment uh-huh okay i'll call back next week yeah the name is uh johnson that's right bye-bye that was his real estate office i get the feeling they haven't seen him lately well maybe he's just gold-breaking maybe kind of pointless though considering he's the boss no i got to do some checking on this baby wonder who his friends are oh i can tell you that him and doc wyatt are big buddies charlie you amazed me how did you know that i see them all the time up at the country club they're always playing golf together country club you getting social on me when ain't that i just caddy up there every once in a while you don't pick up a couple of books moonlighting huh just on sundays it's my day off sheriff i wouldn't want to stand in the way of a man's self-improvement now what about jarvis well he doesn't seem to have many friends just just to stop quiet well i guess i better have a talk with him you knows around walnut lane see what you can find out from the neighbors but charlie uh do it quietly i don't want any phone calls oh sheriff they said you wanted to see me yes sir sorry to bother you doctor oh it's not bother rather look at your faith than the babies i've been in delivery all morning well this won't take long take all the time you like you look healthy so i assume that this is official sort of i understand you're a friend of harry jarvis harry i don't know if he is i was wondering if you'd noticed any well changes in him lately it's funny you should ask he has been out of sorts the past few days seems to be worrying about something thank you senator strain it's possible probably worried about business problems happened to the best of us well i guess it didn't serious then thanks doctor appreciate it if you keep this confidential so it's me uh i wonder if his wife has noticed anything have you seen her lately by the way margaery not for quite a while though she is coming to see me tonight oh no she's coming in for a checkup you mean she'll be in your office tonight uh-huh eight o'clock are you sure of course i'm sure come and see for yourself excuse me miss uh i just want to see if my watch is right i have 10 past state that's what i have well maybe i might be fast well wasn't she here yet she's usually on the dot uh give mrs jarvis a ring and see what's keeping her yes doctor oh what is it well that appointment was canceled i forgot to tell you i substituted mrs phillips when you're out of luck sheriff she canceled oh she didn't cancel doctor it was her husband her husband yes he called a few hours ago what's the trouble sheriff oh nothing if you want to why don't you give her a ring no uh i have a feeling mrs jarvis sitting in thank you thanks scotland [music] got myself into now let's see i'll leave excuse me girls sheriff whister oh come in what a pleasant surprise oh mrs burgin that i'm not disturbing anything oh no no no no it's just the girls come over for a little bridge a little tea would you like a cup of tea oh no thanks not just a little cup i keep telling my husband i never see the sheriff anymore well i've been kind of busy man i was just thinking about you the other day do you know that new teacher over at school miss gunderson oh you want to give her a call you would have a lot in common and if you're interested in slides she has the most wonderful collection all of those marvelous european cathedrals well ma'am oh i know you think i'm a matchmaker but remember sheriff after all you're the last bachelor left in town oh well that's not exactly true you know there's uh uh charlie my deputy and tom down at the firehouse ah but you you're the prize catch oh if i wasn't married i'd be running after you myself well that that's very flattering mrs bergen um i wonder if you would mind if i asked you a couple of questions police business well in a way you know mrs jarvis don't you of course marjorie and i are co-chairman of the home for the agent committee well have you seen her recently no no i haven't and it's rather odd if you ask me she missed a meeting of the famous books club the other day and it was one of her favorites too mo be dick well did she call to let you know she wasn't coming no her husband called me he said she wasn't feeling well have you talked to her since i can't reach her every time i call her her husband says she's either out or washing her hair well thanks mrs bergen you've been very helpful oh what's it all about sheriff you can trust me well it's nothing serious just routine ah you're being very mysterious but i won't pry oh just a minute [music] uh what's this miss gundersen's telephone number [music] [applause] [music] hi come up with anything well it's hard to say i talked to most of the neighbors and i tried not to raise any eyebrows i think i did a pretty good job charlie get to the point has anyone seen mrs jarvis no not for three days she hasn't even taken the garbage out well that still doesn't prove anything no but it's kind of strange the way i hear it is she used to be all over town all the time clubs and meetings it seems that she used to spend hardly any time with her husband hmm oh by the way that mrs logan called you this morning she wanted a car right back well why didn't you leave me a note i couldn't find a pencil [music] hello sheriff worcester ma'am oh i've been trying to reach you all morning why what happened now i'm sure something's wrong last night mr jarvis came out into his backyard and he started digging in his garden digging can you think of any reason on earth why i'd do a thing like that only one and i'm not sure i like it tell you what mrs logan suppose i dropped by your place tonight oh i wish you would i'll be expecting you thank you all right well what you want problems charlie problems see you in the morning oh say uh do you know that new teacher up at the school uh miss gunderson oh sure the fat one uh-huh may not come out again tonight but you can see the hole i i went to bed early last night and then i heard him working in the garden first i thought i was dreaming but there he was in his shirt sleeves he had a shovel he was whistling to himself while he dug whistling and digging after a while i went back to bed but i could still hear him just doesn't make any sense well it makes a lot of sense he's probably killed that poor woman and he's going to bury her out there now now we can't jump to conclusions what else can we do you said yourself she didn't show up for the her doctor's appointment no one's seen her for days it's got to be murder [music] see why don't you go down there and arrest him on what charge there's no law against a man digging in his own backyard sheriff i don't understand why you're so hesitant well because i don't want a suit for false arrest what more do you need it's obvious he's digging a grave out there [music] what is it i think he saw me get away from that wonder [music] well he's gone he must have frightened him away he looked straight at me now he knows i've been watching him well it was bound to happen sooner or later sheriff i don't like it i'm alone here if he decides i know something that's him maybe not i didn't hear any car drive up who else could it be better answer it it's all right i'm here [music] i'll be two feet away [music] i'm jarvis your next-door neighbor oh hell can i come in oh yes of course is there something i can do for you you tell me i beg your pardon i saw you spying on me from your bedroom window why spying i think you're mistaken i just happened to look out oh just happened huh i heard a noise and i was curious i suppose you think it's funny me digging in the garden at night well it's really none of my business that's exactly right it's none of your business but i wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea you see i like to do my gardening at night during the day it's too hot too many bugs but after dark it's cool quiet you can hear yourself think well that's perfectly understandable i'm glad you feel that way maybe now you'll stop watching me honestly mr jarvis i had no intention forget it i think we understand each other oh mr jarvis i'm new here and this town isn't very friendly so well uh i'd like to get to know you and your wife better maybe you two could come over for dinner one evening i'm sorry i my wife doesn't like to go out much but we're right next door to each other i said she doesn't like to go out besides you've probably seen enough of us from your bedroom window [music] you heard that i heard now do you believe me well i never said i doubted janet's logan that still doesn't prove anything all he's done is calling his next-door neighbor the way he talked to me the way he looked at me that still doesn't prove he's burying his wife in his backyard sheriff wisdom do like me of course i do man then remember this he knows that i saw him if he did kill his wife then i am a threat to him think about that aristotle once said that a play should have a beginning a middle and an end but what did he know today a play must have a first half a second half and the station break you have seen only one of these the other two follow [music] so [music] hey hello sheriff what do you want i'd like to talk with you mr jarvis is this police business yes sir i'll come in the place needs a good cleaning but i guess you can see that for yourself then again i wasn't expecting any company well i'll try to be brief is your wife at home my wife why there was an automobile accident in town yesterday i'm investigating it and we think maybe your wife was a witness must be some mistake one of the drivers of the cars gave a pretty good description of her that she was walking her dog so if i could just talk with her a few minutes she isn't here well i can come back tomorrow no no i mean she's away oh vacation well something like that she's uh she's been gone for three days so she couldn't have been witnessed any accident i see well just for the record so we can write it off uh where can we get in touch with her no she went upstate uh she was gonna write me and tell me the name of her hotel but i haven't heard from her yet and she's been gone three days that's right tell me did she take the dog with her yeah yeah she took the dog any more questions no that's all thanks for your cooperation oh you can uh go out the front door [music] sheriff not kind of late aren't you sonny i can stay up as long as i want find your cat yeah it was home under the bed good what'd you see on that jarvis floor why isn't he your friend he's nobody's friend always he can get me on my cat timmy uh timmy's his dog isn't he tell me something son have you seen him today oh mr jarvis no the dog sure i saw him this afternoon he was sitting in the window boxing up a storm your positive it was timmy yep honestly got two dogs thanks [music] [music] food look now mrs bergen why did you do a thing like that i was only trying to help after all it was obvious you were suspicious about something so i just i just baked a cake and went over there i really wasn't in any danger that's not exactly the point when mr jarvis answered the door i said i want to see marjorie i said i have a new recipe that she's interested in mocha madre is very fond of mocha well what did mr jarvis have to say for himself he was positively rude he said marjorie isn't well and he grabbed the cake and he slammed the door in my face wait a minute you mean to say he didn't say his wife was out of town oh of course not why would marjorie go out of town she hasn't been anywhere since i've known her and that's 10 years excuse me sheriff worcester it's me sheriff a little while ago he hopped in his car and he drove off you follow him yeah he went right to bell's hardware store i'm across the street right now hey wait a minute charlie [music] charlie charlie charlie i'm all right here i'm registered listen he just got in his car and drove off he had a package with him should i follow him no you stay where you are i'll meet you he's got to run mr bergen what's he up to do you think he's done something to marjorie tell you what ms bergen if he has you'll be the first to know well howdy sheriff sorry uh you come for your fishing rod sheriff no i'll pick that up next week hmm uh actually uh i came to inquire by one of your customers oh who's that harry jarvis i understand he was just in that's right mind telling me what he bought well let me see he uh he picked up a sack of grass seed mm-hmm anything else yeah a can of rat poison that was it seemed like he was in a hurry well thanks mr bell come on charlie well the grass is easy to figure he wants to see the garden but why the rat poison well maybe he has is it rats that his wife isn't dead yet do you mean you think he's kind of locked up in that house no he wouldn't take a chance like that why the poison well like i said maybe he has this charlie get in touch with al and tell him to meet us at mrs logan's house tonight what fun we're going to see if jarvis has dropped anything that holey's been digging and charlie bring shovels [music] my coffee charlie oh uh actually i'd like something a little bit uh stronger ma'am charlie you're on duty uh coffee will be fine how long are we gonna keep waiting on that guy sheriff you got anything better to do well no no but that whistling's getting on my nerves i wish you'd learn a tune yeah he's been at it since before you came first he started digging now he's covering up did he put anything in the hole he might have i i couldn't watch that carefully because he kept looking up here i'm afraid sheriff he might do something to me after last night i don't want to take any chances all right we may as well move in charlie now let's go charlie get the shovels sheriff [music] you'll let me know what happens just watch from the window you can see for yourself [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] right what are you doing here sorry mr jarvis we're gonna have to do a little digging what you've got no right to go around here digging into my garden that busy body next door she calls you didn't she there i just saw her at the window she called you didn't she we got a tip mr jarvis we want to know why you come out here and dig at night i can't dig in my own property a man can't dig in his own property you've got to admit it looks mighty suspicious i'm sorry i'm eccentric do i have to plan my life to suit you charlie well excuse me [music] [music] [applause] [music] sarah yeah you better come here something buried here [music] make out what it is yeah keep there's something down there all right [music] want to start talking no charlie let me have your life [music] what is it can you make it out jeff it's a dog what all this digging and it ain't nothing but a dead dog what did you expect a body [music] i hated myself for doing it not a cruel man and the dog was sick anyway marjorie being gone i suppose i just wanted to put it out of its misery so i dug the hole and bought the rat poison yep to the dog who else would i give it to [music] wait a minute you mean you were looking for her you mean that character next door said that i might have murdered marjorie let's be frank mr jarvis there's still some mystery as to your wife's whereabouts but to assume that i killed her but you've been giving everybody in town a different story you've told some people she was sick and you told me she was on vacation and with that hole you're digging out and back i guess it did look a little suspicious well i've learned one thing anyway you can't keep a secret in lynn vale what kind of secret marjorie left me sheriff she walked out four days ago just like that no explanations walked in and told me we were through packed her things took our reserve cash and her jewelry and that was that after 15 years of marriage i'm sorry to hear that mr jarvis do you uh no she planning a divorce who knows i don't even know why she left me what does go on in a woman's mind sheriff don't ask me sure we had our fights we we argued a lot but to wake up one morning and find your wife pack in a suitcase it's a little hard to live with i guess i did go overboard drinking and isolating myself probably i did take it all out on the dog she loved that thing i was just somebody who brought the paper home do you mind if i um take a look through the house no i'll help yourself i guess this had to come out anyway might have been a little easier if that busy body next door had kept their blinds closed [music] sheriff worcester you saw what we dug up yes the dog i suppose i should have known why why should you have known because this is linville things like that just don't happen here what did he tell you that his wife had left him that's all there is to it she'll probably sue for divorce you mean to say you believe that sure i do it happens every day then you're taking him out his word well what else can i do i've searched the house in the garage her jewelry is gone personal effects suitcases everything then why did he lie to everyone the poor guy's ashamed he didn't want to know that she'd left him as a matter of fact he's hoping she'll come back when she runs out of money oh it's the most far-fetched story i ever heard look mrs logan i've made a fool out of myself and dug up a man's garden if he wanted to he could get me in a lot of trouble but he's been pretty decent about it he's gonna let it drop and that's just what i'm gonna do let it drop suppose you're wrong bring me some proof then i'll act but until you do i'm just gonna forget it sheriff i don't feel safe with that man around that's something wrong i tell you well there's nothing to fear you just call me if anything happens it would be too late then i'm sorry man but there's nothing i can do i just can't arrest him on your say-so you've made yourself perfectly clear good night no reason uh why we can't be friends i think there is good night [music] tell you one thing boys don't ever get married you should have told me that five years ago yeah well thanks for helping us out [music] [applause] [music] anytime [applause] so so [applause] [music] oh [applause] [music] foreign [music] i still can't believe it what a chance we took it worked in it what did he say when he left give me some proof then i'll act but until you do i want to forget about it fine that's exactly what we want [music] we got work to do [music] so it's a good thing they never looked in your yard [music] give me a hand [music] do you need some help no you fill in the hole i'll take care of things over here [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] hmm [music] [music] so hello mr jarvis sheriff what are you doing back here came for the dog what can we come in well i was just getting ready for bed well this won't take for just a minute but i don't understand i i thought this was all cleared up well there's a city ordinance against burying animals on residential property we'll just dump in this basket and be on our way but i i filled a hole in again look i'll left i'll dig it up in the morning then you come back to the door i wouldn't think of bothering you mr jarvis we bothered you enough already charlie and i can take care of it yeah but i don't you worry about a thing mr jarvis [music] darling here you'll need this [music] [applause] [music] i think our story is further evidence to support my belief that in cases like this there is nothing quite so good as burial at sea it is simple tidy and not very incriminating one word of warning however if you take your wife on a sea voyage buy her a round trip ticket no matter what your plans may be next week i shall return with a story some commercials and more friendly tips for happy husbands until then good night [music] so [music] you

""i know most of the freighter captains, it should be a piece of cake.” i didn't know i'd make 20 log entries a day and fill out reports every night. looks like you did a good job. ""do something, do it right."" that's what my father said. every father says that. even i say that. that's why you're a good parent. you know all the clichés by heart. hello, stranger. haven't seen you in days. i've been filling out reports. there was a reason i didn't join starfleet, i couldn't do this paperwork. smart. there was a time when you couldn't get him to shut up. - i like him better this way. - that's mean. - i was just kidding. - no. you weren't. - worf to captain sisko. - sisko here. can you come to the bridge? we've picked up a distress call. we've been unable to establish two-way communication, but the signal is coming from the rutharian sector. let's hear it, chief. ...and commander gatsby is dead, too. i didn't see other escape pods leave before the ship was destroyed, so i may be the only survivor. my pod was torn open on impact and the rain is pouring in. i'll take the radio and a survival kit. the environmental suits were damaged in the crash. this is an l-class world and the atmosphere is barely breathable. repeat: this is a general distress call. i am a united federation of planets citizen and a starfleet officer. if you can hear me, please respond. my government will reward you for any assistance and most of all, you'll be my personal heroes. that's enough. - how long will it take us to reach her? - at maximum warp, six days. - any other ships closer to that sector? - no, sir. mr worf, turn us around and set a course for the rutharian sector. aye, sir. chief, i want you to establish a two-way com link and when you do, tell her... tell her her ""heroes"" are on the way. captain's log, supplemental. the starfleet officer, whose name, we've learned, is lisa, continues to transmit her call for help. but chief o'brien has been unable to establish two-way communication. - how's it going? - slow. she's transmitting on a rotating subspace frequency. we can't return her signal. - do you have to keep that on? - no, but she is all alone. - the least i can do is listen. - she doesn't know you're listening. you're not comforting her by listening. it doesn't bother me. sometimes it feels like she's actually talking to me. it's true. especially when she talks of her home and family. - she reminds me of my cousin. - 'i don't believe it. it's raining again. how can there be so much water and so little life? - i'll leave you two alone. - i'm starting to hate this place. this is a general distress call. hello? are you paying attention? i know you're out there. i know you can hear me. so just answer me. tell me you're on your way. tell me i'm going to be rescued. tell me i'm not going to die alone. i hope you're satisfied. i'm sure nothing gives you more pleasure than stifling my creativity. only you would consider bar stools to be a form of artistic expression. let's see how creative you are. have you picked out the major's gift yet? - gift? - for this saturday. you do know what saturday is? - saturday? - yes. it's the one-month anniversary of your first date with major kira. - i suppose it is. - and you haven't picked out a gift. why should i? the man's experienced unrequited love for the better part of three years. now he has her, he wants to know why he should celebrate their anniversary. - whatever you're selling won't work. - you think i'm going to get involved? the last thing i want to deal with is a lover looking for a last-minute gift. there's a promenade of shopkeepers out there, if you want to buy a gift. a one-month anniversary gift. ever heard of anything so ridiculous? ok. so now you... now you have him looking for a gift. what are you up to? i tell you, you'll write it down. next thing, i'm in a holding cell. i won't write a word, i promise. - this is character research. - right. quark, listen. i'm working on a crime novel, but i've hit a wall in my writing. it's not truthful anymore. phony, artificial. i'm having trouble creating real characters, especially nefarious ones. if you could just let me watch and listen as you pull off... whatever it is you're going to pull off, it could help me. you could give me insight. i could even model my lead character after you. lesson number one. no one involved in an extra-legal activity thinks of himself as nefarious. - sorry. - i'm a businessman, ok? now, if you're interested in learning more about my business... - i think that can be arranged. - great. but nothing you see or hear turns up in print and none of it gets back to your father, understand? completely. so there is a sun after all. now that the sun's up, i can see how truly ugly my new home is. there's nothing out there but dirt and rocks, more dirt and more rocks. chief? can i ask you a personal question? sure. are you uncomfortable having me aboard the defiant? no. why should i be? i'm a civilian. isn't it awkward having me aboard a warship? we've had civilians aboard before. it doesn't bother me. - i was afraid you'd say that. - i'm sorry. hello! this is lisa cusak. i'm receiving your transmission. can you hear me? hello, hello! i could hear you two talking. - can you hear me? - yes! we can hear you. thank god. whoever you are, i love you. my name is lisa cusak. i was the commanding officer of the olympia. we left the federation eight years ago for an exploration of the beta quadrant. what happened to your ship, captain? we were heading home, but then we picked up strange energy readings in a nearby star system and we stopped to investigate. we found an energy barrier around the fourth planet. probing it with our scanners triggered a quantum reaction. a surge of metrion radiation disabled our engines and we spiralled toward the surface. i gave the order to abandon ship. the last thing i remember is a console exploding in my face. i woke up in an escape pod and i've spent the last day and a half sitting in this cave, trying to raise someone on subspace. dr bashir, chief medical officer. are you sure you are on a l-class planet? positive. to answer your next question, i've been giving myself 15cc's of triox every four hours to compensate for the excess carbon dioxide. - like it says in my medical tricorder. - how much triox do you have left? 150 milliliters. will you reduce the dosage to 8cc's every six hours? - we need to stretch out your supply. - what happens when she runs out? that's a good question. what happens then? you will experience the effects of hypoxia, but the triox compound will strengthen your cardiopulmonary system, allowing you to better withstand the effects. in other words, i'm going to be gasping for air by the time you get here. - yes, i'm afraid so. - thanks for brightening my day. - is there anything we can do? - there is, actually. the injections are keep me awake and i haven't talked to anyone for two days. we'll help you with that, captain. i'll have one of my officers stay on the line with you at all times. - and order them to enjoy it! - done. - 80, who's first? - i think i'd better start. sounds good to me. a lot has happened since you left, captain. the second fleet hit dominion forces occupying betazed three times in the last month, but they keep sending reinforcements and fortifying their positions... ok. that's it, please. no more war news. - you're depressing me. - sorry. no. i'm sorry. i'm sorry for you and me and everyone in the federation. i can't believe we're at war. let's change the subject. how about some good news? things to look forward to when i get home. tell me people still fall in love, get married and raise families. - they do. - good. - what about you? are you married? - no. seeing anyone? i'd like to think there's still something positive in the life of a starship captain these days. - i am seeing someone. - now we're talking. - tell me about her. what's her name? - kasidy yates. - the same kasidy i spoke to earlier? - that's her. - she one of your officers? - no, civilian. freighter captain. sounds like you're having problems. - why would you say that? - there's no joy in your voice. the tension level went up when you said her name. you sounded more relaxed talking about the war. - ben, are you still there? - yes, i'm still here. you just... caught me off-guard... a little. i can tell. back when i was a junior officer i dated a civilian for six years. want to hear about it? sure you do. why? it's a funny story and one of us needs to cheer up. we met on andor. i was assigned to the federation embassy, as an attaché. he was in the andorian agricultural ministry. at first, he kept pointing his antennae at me whenever i walked through his office and i found that rude. excuse me, coming through. excuse me. - odo? - well.. this is it. can i see it? very nice. the major will love it. how are you going to give it to her? what sort of evening do you have planned? - i don't have anything planned. - fortunately for you, there's still time. - pick one. - a holosuite program? it's your anniversary. you have to do something special. i bought her a gift. have it your way, but if it were me and i had found true love after a lifetime of searching, every month would be worth celebrating. all right. let me look at those programs. come on. looks like the constable is going to be busy saturday night. he won't be following me around the station or watching the airlocks for criminals or monitoring the cargo bays for illegal transactions. - he has deputies. - deputies i can handle. with odo out of the way my biggest problem will be deciding what to do with the money i'm going to make. ...both my sisters are teachers. i don't know how they do it. personally, i can't stand children. i know everybody loves children. not me. - yeah. - what about you? you like children? oh, yeah. - really? - yeah. doctor, i'm starting to think that maybe you're not really paying attention to... wait a minute. what's that? there's something moving out there. - it's getting closer. - what? stay back. - no! don't hurt me. - captain, what's going on? please, stay back. no, don't... no! captain cusak, can you hear me? hello? hello? god... - she's gone. - who is this? what have you done? - i have eaten her. - what? i've eaten her! what difference does it make to you? you weren't even listening to her. you have my sincere apologies. i was carried away with my work. i'm a patient. doesn't that make me your work?' you're absolutely right. i don't know what i was thinking. you now have my complete attention. i've got news for you, doc. i'm all talked out. it's time for you to take your patient's mind off her impending doom. - you're not doomed. - i feel better already. see how easy that was? now keep going. what should i talk about? how did they let you out of medical school with this bedside manner? - are you sure you're a doctor? - yes, i graduated second in my class. and we're especially proud of that, aren't we? i feel it will take some hours to crawl from this hole i've dug for myself. not at all. it will take you days. you have my assurance they're high-quality crystals. you won't get them at this price anywhere else in the quadrant. five days, cargo bay 3. see you then. i'll take this one. ""paris, 1928."" nice choice. say what you will about humans today. their past was certainly romantic. - book us four hours on sunday night. - you mean saturday. i mean sunday. saturday is the anniversary. our first date ended badly. i don't want to commemorate it. i'm celebrating the anniversary of our first kiss. - your first kiss? - romantic, isn't it? come on. come on. what's going on? my partner... i can't get him on the channel. he's changed his com system protocols. - you just talked to him. - he's a wanted man. he's careful about using subspace. the authorities might try and trace his signal. i have no way of contacting him until he gets here saturday night. - can't you explain he'll have to wait? - haven't you been paying attention? if he sets foot here with odo on duty we'll be in a holding cell faster than you can say ""criminal conspiracy”. - what are you going to do? - i think... my best option is... panic. when fighting first broke out, i thought, ""all right, o'brien, you've done this before. ""keep your head down... ""focus on the job and you'll get through this, ""just like you did in the last war."" but this war is different. maybe i'm different. i have this growing sense of isolation. i see people. i talk to them, i laugh with them, and... but some part of me is always saying, ""they may not be here tomorrow. don't get too close”. i'm sorry. i shouldn't be laying all this on your shoulders, captain. no, it's all right, miles. it sounds like you need to talk with someone. i'm sure it's the last thing you need to hear. - i should be cheering you up. - forget about me. you're the one who needs cheering up. there's a sad state of affairs. you've seen a lot of combat in the last year. that's a heavy burden. - are you sure you're not a counsellor? - i'm sure. i'll let you in on a secret. i dislike the concept of a ship's counsellor. me too. i like some of them personally, but... - but sometimes they get in the way. - that's exactly how i feel. but saying it out loud is almost heresy. and there's this assumption that only someone with a diploma can listen to your problems or give you advice. - sometimes all you need are friends. - exactly. - so where are they? - excuse me? where are your friends, miles? why aren't they helping you? well, we... i haven't spoken to them about any of this. it's not the kind of thing you talk about. if you can't talk to your friends and you can't talk to your wife, you know who that leaves? the ship's counsellor! - excuse me. it's 1800 hours. - already? - afraid so. - but we're still talking. boys, don't fight over me. miles, i'll talk to you in the morning. - and think about what i said. - all right. i will. - good night, captain. - good night. don't let me keep you from your work, julian. i know how busy you are. no work tonight. you've decided to spend your time conversing with your patient again. three days in a row. you must be swamped with paperwork. i feel awful, keeping you from your duties. i managed to catch up with all my paperwork this afternoon. let me guess. thanks to your genetically engineered brain you did the work of ten other doctors at the same time. you've answered my next question. ""how are you feeling?"" i can hear you're in your usual acerbic good mood. wrong again, my superhuman friend. - i'm not feeling well at all. - tell me. the last injection didn't do the trick. i feel this heavy weight on my chest. it's harder to breathe and every time i move my head, the cave spins. come in. - what is it? - captain cusak has run out of triox. she's feeling the effects of co2 poisoning. i thought she had at least a day's worth of injections left. apparently the last vial was tainted, probably in the crash. - how long does she have? - no more than two days. that's not good. we're still three days away. - we need more speed. - speed's not the problem. i could increase the warp plasma 97 gigahertz. that would increase our velocity to warp 9.5 and save us a full day. the defiant's problem is structural integrity when going above warp 9. at those speeds the ship literally starts tearing herself apart. can we strengthen the integrity field? not without bleeding power from another source. - such as? - the phaser reserves. we could be at a disadvantage should we encounter a dominion ship. we're a long way from the front lines. chances of meeting a dominion ship are negligible. - we should not take that risk. - she'll die if we don't get there faster. - use the phaser reserve, chief. - aye, sir. thank you, sir. - how's it going? - we're increasing speed. - the captain's condition is worsening. - i see. - is there anything i can do? - i don't think so. - well. i guess i'll see you later. - right. - are you sure you want to hear this? - trust me, ben. i'd rather be worrying about your love life than about my own problems. well... when kasidy came to the bridge last night, all i wanted her to do was leave and i couldn't tell you why. she doesn't belong there, ben. that's why. she doesn't belong in that part of your life and you know it. off duty, i'm sure kasidy is exactly what you need. but on the defiant, she's a random element, a piece that doesn't fit anywhere in the puzzle. she was the convoy liaison officer on our last mission, and a damned good one. this isn't about her. this is about you. you have trouble doing your job when she's on the defiant. that's a problem. it's also affecting your relationship and that's another problem. don't take it so hard. you can't mix your personal and professional lives. most people can't. i certainly can't. i once served on the same starbase as my sister. what a nightmare that was. i look forward to meeting you, lisa. i'm sure i'm not the only one around here who feels the same way. if you ask me, everyone on that ship could use some r and r. - beautiful, aren't they? - gorgeous. do you know how much i was going to get for these? - almost 200 bars. - that's a lot. no kidding, that's a lot. now, they're just a crate full of junk. there's a chance that odo won't find out about this. no, he'll find out. odo would love nothing better than to see me in jail. - and after all i did for him. - like what? like helping him find true love. if it wasn't for me, he and major kira would never have gotten together. i was there for him during all the heartache and the lonely nights. he was wallowing in misery because she was still seeing shakaar. i told him to make his move. i told him not to give up. i was there for him. and what did i get out of it? nothing. he still spies on me. he still bothers me about minor infractions of the law. and he still can't wait for the opportunity to send me to prison. i should have remembered the 285th rule of acquisition. ""no good deed ever goes unpunished."" - to failure. - i'm not drinking to that. jake, in ten minutes, my business partner's ship will dock. in 15 minutes, odo will arrest him. in 20 minutes, my name will come up. and in 25 minutes, odo will walk in here with a warrant. you should humour me on this one. quark. i'd like that holosuite now, after all. - you would? - that's right. it turns out nerys agrees with you. she wants to celebrate the anniversary of our first date. so here we are. is the holosuite still available? it's all yours. the program? - odo, have a good time. - thank you, quark. i'm sure we will. - i don't believe it. - neither do 1. i'm going to win this one, jake. you know what the best part is? i beat odo. i finally beat him. jake, i did it. i beat him. - he looks happy. - he should be. he's about to make his biggest profit of the year. you sure you want to let him get away with smuggling denevan crystals? i owe him one. so he'll get this one, but just this one. why is it every time i think i have you figured out you do something to surprise me? like tonight. where did you get the idea to celebrate our one-month anniversary in paris? some mysteries are better left unsolved. i want a scan of that barrier but use passive sensors only. an active scan is what triggered the destruction of the olympia. it's an exogenic field generated by unstable elements in the planet's core. captain cusak has lost consciousness. we have to get her to sick bay in the next 45 minutes. the defiant can't penetrate the barrier. the energy is composed of metrion radiation. if we get near it, the dilithium matrix in the warp core will collapse and we'll be pulled down onto the planet's surface like the olympia. - options? - could we beam through it? we can't get close enough to the barrier to initiate transport. a shuttle pod impulse engine doesn't use antimatter. it is unlikely a shuttle could withstand the gravimetric stresses. unlikely, but not impossible. i didn't come all this way to give up. i'll take the risk. doctor, mr o'brien, you're with me. mr worf, you have the bridge. sisko to defiant. we're preparing to enter the barrier. - good luck, captain. - thank you. - shields down to 73%. - primary power grid off-line. - switching to backups. - shields at 50%. losing the navigational computer. - secondary nav comp on-line. - we're coming out of it. damage report. some buckling in the starboard hull plating, but otherwise fine. - scan the planet, doctor. - not showing any life sign. wait. i've found the crash site and the cave. is there somewhere we can set down? yes. it will be tight for time. we've got to get her back on the ship in 20 minutes. still no life readings. this has to be the only direction she could have been headed in. over here. it was a human female. 51 years of age at time of death. cause of death: carbon dioxide poisoning. it can't be lisa. that woman's been dead for years. three years and two months but all the evidence fits: age, rank, the way she died. if she's been dead for three years how has she been talking to us? it must be the energy barrier. when her radio signal passed through the barrier's metrion radiation the signal time-shifted into the future. then when you sent the return signal? it went through the barrier and travelled back in time in the same way. we've been talking to someone from the past? so what do we do now? we should bury her. no. not here. not alone in this cave. we'll take her back with us. give her a proper burial among friends. it's called an irish wake. it's a way to memorialise a death and celebrate life at the same time. what are we supposed to do? drink, sing songs, laugh, cry, talk about the deceased. it sounds almost klingon. - hey. - hey, yourself. when this is over, i want to talk to you about something. - something that's been on my mind. - ok. - is it about me? - it's about me, actually. ah, that's a relief. i want to try to explain about my behaviour lately. sounds good to me. but we'll talk about it over dinner. - you cook. - that's a deal. ...i just wanted to say that... although i only talked with her for a very short time, i really admired lisa cusak. i cared about her and i'm going to miss her. and another thing. contrary to public opinion, i am not the arrogant, self-absorbed, god-like doctor that i appear to be on occasion. why don't i hear anybody objecting to that statement? - i will if you insist. - i insist. - then i object. - thank you, miles edward o'brien. no, i have a heart and i really care about all of you, even if sometimes it would appear that i care more about my work. to the woman who taught me that it is sometimes necessary to say these things. - lisa cusak. - to lisa. i never shook her hand and i never saw her face. but she made me laugh and she made me weep. she was all by herself and i was surrounded by my friends. yet i felt more alone than she did. we've grown apart, the lot of us. we didn't mean for it to happen but it did. the war changed us. it pulled us apart. lisa cusak was my friend but you are also my friends and i want my friends in my life because someday we're going to wake up and we're going to find that someone is missing from this circle and on that day, we're going to mourn, and we shouldn't have to mourn alone. to lisa and the sweet sound of her voice."
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and brooders. i decided to go into the egg business. like any other business it needs fresh ideas. here is our latest design. its advantages are obvious. no more eggs rolling off the table. valuable storage space saved in the refrigerator. unfortunately, this particular innovation has not filtered down below the management level. our executives quickly saw its possibilities. but the hens seem rather slow at grasping new ideas. this is one of our plastic models. we have a large number of them scattered about to demonstrate to the hens what can be done if they put their minds to it. as you can see, we are using every psychological weapon at man's disposal. and now, perhaps, this slogan will also give you strength to bridge the gap between this vignette and tonight's story. greetings. lovely day, isn't it? no doubt you're very surprised to find yourself visiting me here in my poultry farm in new zealand. the only poultry farm of any size completely and perfectly run by one man, myself. oh, but you're right, that still doesn't make me famous, does it? oh, nowadays, when television cameras pry everywhere you're probably more accustomed to visiting the homes of well-known statesmen, artists. people who, shall we say, have made their mark. well, i have made my mark. i could be quite famous if i chose to be. the reason you've never heard of me is that i succeeded. i succeeded and only failure in the particular accomplishment i'm speaking of brings notoriety. you're a lovely plump one, aren't you? yes, nicely stuffed and basted with just the right amount of seasoning. you'll make a superb dinner. yes, that's right. i'm a murderer. perfect, i think. why is it that the only time food turns out superbly is when you cook it yourself? there. excellent. oh, did i shock you when i told you i was a murderer? i hope not. i certainly didn't mean to. actually, there's a very common misconception held by most people about murderers. how often have you heard us described as ""cold-blooded,"" ""fiends,"" ""inhuman monsters"" and the like? deplorable exaggerations, really. but, obviously, you can see i'm not any of those things. the truth is, in my own case it was an act of kindness. there. all finished. mmm. you see, helen personified all those qualities in people which made me withdraw from them and choose chickens instead. oh, true, chickens have all the same qualities, but in them, it's forgivable. well, at least they can't take advantage of someone like myself, someone too sympathetic, too understanding. oh, helen was only one of the many who took advantage of these qualities in me. but she was certainly the worst. you see, helen believed in her own golden rule. ""every man for himself."" ahh. of course, in her case it was different. it was ""every woman."" perhaps, you'll understand it better if i told you exactly how it happened. you see, helen and i were engaged and everything was going along fairly smoothly, until one night she arrived here at the farm unexpectedly. oh, it's too dreadful. i just don't know how to tell you. i really don't. tell me what, my dear? well, i... oh, no, i can't. i just can't! but arthur, you must believe one thing. i don't want to hurt you. i couldn't bear to hurt you. i told it to stanley, i told everyone the same thing. and now you're telling me. but i have to. it's the only thing i can do. i assumed that. now, just what is this dreadful calamity? well... i can't marry you, my darling. you can't marry me. how ironic. well, that's a funny thing to say. not really. so, you can't marry me. well, that means you're marrying someone else. and i suppose this, uh, stanley is the lucky man? how much is he settling on you? it will be easier for both of us if you would be a little bit more civilized about it. oh, but i am being civilized. i'm releasing you. i wish you well. i even wish this poor stanley, whoever he is, well. you know perfectly well who he is! you introduced me to him. you can't mean stanley braithwaite. that gambler? financier. oh! well, whatever he's calling himself these days he still has the most appalling table manners of anyone i've ever met. it so happens that there are more important things in the world than table manners. oh? though you may not think so. and what is your idea of more important things? well, to live some kind of life. travel, see the world, wonderful places, wear good clothes, jewellery. one thing about you, helen, your aspirations have always been of the highest. but most of all, not to be buried in this farm, as you call it. why not what you used to call it? a haven. a place where one could spend the rest of one's life in peace. really, arthur, you have a talent for being nasty. do i? one sometimes takes on the coloring of one's associates. think i'd better go. yes. no doubt stanley is waiting. but you could tell me one thing before you go. why did you agree to marry me in the first place? i was afraid at the time that there might not be anything better. goodbye, arthur. hello, john, nice to see you. hello, arthur. not an official visit, i trust? oh, not likely. i was on my way into town, thought i'd stop by and see the new pride and joy. well, how do you like it? very impressive. filled with labor-saving devices, no doubt? oh, completely. come inside and i'll show you. with all this new machinery, i'll even be able to mix the feed for the chickens myself. and i've got everything i need for a balanced diet stored in these tanks. that seems to be your new ambition in life, to be able to run the whole place entirely by yourself. not so new. it's been my ambition for over a year. yes, ever since helen. ever since... ever since i came of age, shall we say? well, that's one way of putting it. are you really happier like this? but of course. why should that puzzle you? i don't know. it seems as if, by rights, that you should be married. married is the last thing i'll ever be. john, you don't know the joy of having everything exactly the way you want it. no petty annoyances. no catering to other people's demands. it's the perfect life, really. but do you like living alone? i like doing what most people would like to do, but simply haven't the courage. they're so afraid of being lonely, they surround themselves with a lot of friends they don't even like. or marry them. and spend the rest of their lives wondering why they're so miserable. that's what i call really cynical. but you'll change your mind. one day some pretty little thing will come along and then... well, we'll see. are we playing chess tonight? most certainly. i'll see you at the pub, around the same time. good, i look forward to it. darling, i'm back. she'd come back to me, indeed. with a vengeance. she chattered endlessly all through dinner but i wasn't really listening. i was realizing how perfectly she'd timed her arrival. once she had her foot in the door, i knew i'd never be able to close it! she was all charm and affection, overflowing with solicitude. calmly taking my sympathy for granted. unhappily, it made me remember something i'd said in the delirium of our early days. that no matter what ultimately happened between us, if she was ever in trouble, she was to count on my help. i'm a man of my word and i couldn't bear the idea of going back on it. wasn't that a good dinner? delicious. i can get the coffee, then we can have it in the living room. we can leave the dishes till the morning. you mean not wash them? well, we can wash them in the morning. what's the difference? apparently none. did you think this was an ashtray, helen? no, of course not. i just couldn't find one, so i used it. ash won't hurt it, darling. there. have your coffee. thank you, no. arthur, what's the matter? what are you looking at me like that for? you've been doing it all through dinner. what have i been doing all through dinner? well, looking at me as though... uh, as though you're angry with me, or as though you weren't really glad to see me. oh, but i am glad to see you. why shouldn't i be? oh. you're thinking about that awful scene we had the last time i was here, aren't you? it has crossed my mind, yes. well, we were both upset. we both did things we didn't really mean. it'll be different. you'll see. i am seeing. does this mean that you've left your husband for good? oh, you were so right about him, arthur. he was a beast, more than you could know. a wealthy beast, as i remember. money isn't everything. isn't it? but that's not what you thought a year ago. well, i've learnt a lot in a year. so have i. principally, that i like my life the way it is now. and i won't have any changes. but i'm not going to change your life, darling. your just being here changes it. oh... you're not going to send me away? where would i go? what would i do? i'm sorry, darling. oh, don't fuss. it's only an old coffee cup. would you like a liqueur? oh, i'd love one. you really haven't anyplace to go, have you, helen? only here. that means you haven't any money, either. he didn't give me a penny. but the courts... oh, no! i couldn't take him to court! i mean, you can't fight a man as rich as that. all those lawyers and things. oh, yes, i see. so, if i threw you out, you'd be miserable. i'd rather be dead. a very wise decision, i think, my dear. and the least i can do, for old times' sake, is grant it. john. may i come in? oh, please do. anything wrong? i'm afraid it is. you mean this is an official visit? yes. nothing serious, i hope. it's very serious. oh. well, you better come in. if it's going to be serious we may as well make ourselves comfortable. please. i'm here to ask if you know a woman called helen braithwaite. oh, but of course. i was engaged to her once. uh, before she married stanley braithwaite. when did you last see her? oh, about three weeks ago. she arrived here one night unexpectedly. why, john, i believe you thought i was going to lie about it. well, she's been traced as far as your farm. no one's seen or heard of her since. oh, i'm so glad. you're glad? yes, she managed to get away from him after all. away from whom? well, her husband. she'd left him and he wanted her back. apparently he was a dreadful man and she'd rather do anything than that. i see. exactly when did she come here? oh, about um... three weeks ago, on a thursday. as a matter of fact it was the night i had to call off our chess game if you remember. i remember, the 24th. what happened? well, i... i don't mind telling you. uh, but... well, i wouldn't want it gossiped about, i know i can rely on your discretion. you see, she came expecting me to help her. i saw no reason why i should. when i refused, she became angry and left in a rage. as a matter of fact, she left her suitcase behind. it's still here. i'm expecting her to send for it. may i see it? but of course. wouldn't you say it's a little strange for a woman to leave without her suitcase and her purse? i'm a bachelor, sergeant. and i don't know how a woman is supposed to behave. i think the simplicity of my story, the seeming stupidity of it, made him wonder if his first suspicions weren't a trifle unjust. had i been a murderer, i would surely have tried to dump the incriminating evidence in the river and thus join the large group of us who have made that one mistake. things thrown into rivers have a way of floating up at the most awkward moments. and i knew that the suitcase, or anything else being here, meant nothing, unless they also found helen's body. oh, hello, john. this is inspector ben liebenberg of the cid. mr. arthur williams. good afternoon. i'm sorry to trouble you. that's quite all right. won't you come in? thank you. well, what can i do for you? well, mr. williams, we're still trying to find this unfortunate young woman, mrs. braithwaite. oh, you mean there's still no trace of her? not since she left here. what a nice little house you have here. yes, isn't it? would you care to look around? thank you, i would. follow me. i started with the living room and dining room. it was nice of the inspector to take such an interest in my house and i was only too glad to show him around. he seemed to be most thorough in his appreciation. and then we went into the kitchen. i explained for the inspector's benefit that i disliked having servants around and had made my house and farm as self-contained as possible. after we'd gone all over i took them into the poultry house. i explained to them the layout of the chickens. the less they moved about the heavier they would become and the more marketable. when i showed them the new barn, again, they were fascinated by the obvious hiding place my storage tanks provided. but they said nothing. well, thank you very much, mr. williams. it was a pleasure. i'm very proud of my farm. yes, i can see that. well, we'll say goodbye now. goodbye. arthur. goodbye. a week passed and they still hadn't returned. but i was becoming irritated by the constant surveillance. particularly by constable barry. they'd altered his beat, so that he was able to pass my gate and keep an eye on everything which went on. that was when i decided to bring things to a head. and it seemed to me that the simplest way to do that was to appear to make crippen's mistake and run away. i'd picked my hiding place very carefully. i knew the police had searched the extensive caves a few miles from my farm very thoroughly. chances were, i wouldn't be disturbed. and i wasn't. but at the end of three days i decided my purpose had been accomplished. besides, i'd run out of reading material and i was beginning to be bored by my cuisine, which, while adequate, was somewhat limited by my equipment. why john, what a pleasant surprise. where have you been? oh, were you worried? i'm so sorry. it occurred to me mrs. braithwaite might have got lost somewhere in the caves, so i went to look for her. but you've been away three days! yes, unfortunately, i got lost myself and it took me all this time to find my way out. my, but you, uh, certainly have been busy. find anything? you'd better go inside, the inspector will want to see you. oh, i shall be delighted to see him again. you go ahead, i'll follow you. it's not a very likely story, is it, mr. williams? likely or not, it's true. do you really expect us to believe such an obvious lie? i expect you to be polite. considering the amount of damage you've done to my property already, it's the least you can do. we were only doing our duty. really? well, the only justification you could have for doing it is finding what you're looking for. mr. williams, i want... sergeant, we found the body, sir. really? how extraordinary. where was it? well, it was in the barn, sir. it's all right, constable. you can go now. oh, i see. it was a little trick. i'm disappointed in you, inspector. i'd expected something less childish from you. of course, they never found helen's body. and as much as they might suspect she had been murdered, they had no proof. in spite of their thorough search, no body was found and that, along with the fact that there was no obvious motive on my part, resulted in the cloud of suspicion gradually dispersing. by christmas even sergeant theron became convinced of my innocence. and now, to show there were no hard feelings i sent him a brace of cockerels as a christmas present. well, that's all there is to tell. sergeant theron enjoyed the cockerels very much indeed. and i was pleased about that. i'd raised those particular chickens on a special new diet i'd taken great pains with. the ingredients were varied and i'd processed them all myself, using my new hammer-mill to grind everything very fine. sergeant theron asked me to list the ingredients i used so he could make a mixture for his own chickens. i was glad to. i listed them all. all but one, that is. i left out that one special ingredient that made it, really. there was a very sad end to our story. because of the excellent bone, meat and blood meal mr. williams kept supplying them, his chickens grew to enormous size. then it happened. one day, as he shouldered his way through the hungry flock... but it's too awful to describe. please rejoin me in a minute after i pull myself together. i have abandoned the egg business. our model was successful in only one case. one hen dutifully reproduced it perfectly. but unfortunately, the uses of a plastic egg are rather limited. it appears to be time to say goodnight. next week, we shall be back with another story."
1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,"[theme music] i wonder how many wives around the world who would actually murder their husbands, if it was positively guaranteed they would get away with it. quite a few. here is one way that is worth considering. go out and buy 13 oysters in the shell. bury one of them in the soil of a potted plant for 48 hours. then, dig it up and squeeze just one drop of its juice onto each of the six oysters you are serving to your beloved spouse for supper that evening. your own six you leave alone. later on, i promise you, the wretched man will be smitten with shellfish poisoning so virulent that he will succumb before dawn breaks. and not one finger of blame will be pointed at you. the poor fellow ate a bad oyster, and that's all they'll ever be able to say about it. now watch this story. [music playing] roald dahl (voiceover): mr. appleby was about to open his fourth antique shop. his rather unusual methods of business had got him into the habit of disposing of a wife and a shop in a different town every few years. mr. appleby hated to sell anything. he loved his bric-a-brac. consequently, three successive marriages to three well-to-do ladies had, to date, made good his losses. appleby antiques absorbed other people's capital. [music continues] you don't believe in bad luck, missus? miss. [bell ringing] i'm not open for business yet. oh, dear. i've seen just the thing i need. what? that. it's perfect for a friend i loathe. i shall be open tomorrow. how much? it's not for sale, not until tomorrow. you remind me of my father. - really? - yes. he was a stickler. everything in its time and place. [bell ringing] please! what? your cigarette! oh! ash never hurt a rug. i-- shouldn't be there. that's far too, uh-- everything's at sixes and sevens. i'm terribly sorry, ma'am. miss! miss sturgis. very well. miss, if you insist. you seem rather attached to that awful rug. it has sentimental value. that's all. you positively can't bring yourself to sell the vase until tomorrow? no. not until i'm straight, i'm sorry. mm, pity my friend would have hated it so much. (laughs) well, i'm prepared to pay the price, mr. appleby. i'm not without money. shall we say, i'm one of the fortunate few? perhaps i'll pop by again tomorrow. by all means, do. [bell ringing] [music playing] [bell ringing] [music continues] hello again. have you cracked a bottle of champagne over it yet? what? the shop. it's the official opening day, isn't it? yes. but no champagne. no. pity. i imagine you still have that unspeakable vase? [bell ringing] oh, yes. it's even worse than i thought. perfect. right! how much? well, i-- it's not for sale. no, as a matter of fact. oh, come now, mr. appleby. we mustn't be silly. you have a living to make. besides, i'm sure you are dying to get rid of it. i know i would be. you see i-- (sighs) please, miss sturgis. would you come through? oh. how sweet. you remembered my name. i have rather a good memory. really? oh! you're obviously very tidied. yes. i like things in order. just like my father. obsessive. i was saying-- oh, yes. yes, so you were. i only sell objet d'art. what? works of art. what, this junk? oh, please. my shop is my life, and furthermore, it is the policy of the shop never to sell anything unless the prospective purchaser shows a-- a true appreciation of the article in question and can assure it the care and attention to which it is entitled. really? well you must be flat broke. oh, uh-- no, no. no, i wouldn't say that. well, you can't make a living. oh, i survive. but, uh-- that's not the point. if i sell, i must be quite sure that the article goes to a good home. any other policy would be a betrayal, a desecration. what an unusual man you are, mr. appleby. fascinating! of course, i was only teasing about the vase. my friend will adore it, cherish it. but, uh-- i must go. i'm keeping you. no, no. no-- no, i hope i haven't kept you. oh! no, no, no. i'm a woman of leisure. i don't you to work for my living. uh, may i? yes. please. you know, it's quite uncanny. you even dress like my father. you were with him to the last? yes. yes, i was. then if i may say so, miss sturgis, you deserve your reward. because, well, a woman such as yourself could have married at almost any time and left the nursing of an aging father to someone else. you must have made a considerable sacrifice. well, i don't deny i've had my dreams, mr. appleby. but that's all they were. i dare say, all they'll ever be now. i don't see why. because i've never met the man who could fit those dreams. no? no. i'm hardly a simpering schoolgirl anymore, am i? well that isn't the way i would have expressed-- you see, i know my bank balance would outweigh my looks. i'm a realist, mr. appleby. but i admit that what i yearn for most is a decent, respectable man, who would devote himself to me and make the memory of my dear father a living thing. oh, please. don't say anything. i must go. i've said too much already. [bell ringing] [clock ticking] [bell ringing] i'd given up hope. three days, and you didn't call in. why didn't you? oh, well i-- i felt we both needed time to, uh-- to think about our friendship. i knew i did. [commotion outside] oh. oh, i-- and have you? yes! yes, i've thought about it a great deal. and-- i'm sure you have, too. yes, well-- i-- i remembered what you'd said about-- about your father, and how you would always hoped you'd meet a man like him. i'd nearly given up hope. i-- i've-- (sighs excitedly) [clock ticking] martha? yes. i believe you've met that man. do you, arthur? do you? yes. yes i do, with all my heart. truth is, i'm very lonely. i believe you are, too. perhaps i am. oh, martha. i-- i'll give you respect, tenderness. could you, uh-- i mean, would you marry me? [ticking continues] (breathlessly) oh! (sighs excitedly) [church bells ringing] i still think it's all been a bit hasty, don't you? it's love, father. well, don't look so gloomy. the old boy doesn't get a penny till she dies. [church bells continue] [clock chiming] just off to the shop, dear. so soon? half past nine. i ought to open at 10 precisely. - oh, i didn't mean that. - what then? well, when i said so soon, i meant-- um-- how long have we been married, arthur? three weeks. and already, you're forgetting your promise, aren't you? no, i don't think so, dear. why, no. to devote yourself to me. but i am devoted, dear. i am. but you can't be, dear, if you're at your shop. a man must work! my man mustn't, dear. what? my money is more than enough. your income wouldn't keep me in cigarettes. i do wish you wouldn't smoke. - are you criticizing me? - no, no. no, it's just, uh-- no. - good. that's settled then. this morning, no shop. you'll help me with a crossword. then, i shall cook you a nice lunch to build you up. well, i-- i don't take lunch, dear. i did say. yes, i know you did, dear. but a husband who only eats soft boiled eggs is never going to satisfy me. [music playing] eat up. there's a good boy. horseradish? i don't take condiments. (laughs) my father was a pernickety eater. so like you. [music continues] i'm fine, mr. gainsborough. a joyful bride. arthur's become so-- so devoted. yes! yes, i'll ring tomorrow night. same time. bye! [music continues] oh! i'm just going up, arthur. oh. you and your glass of water. my father always had a glass of water at 9'clock. settles my stomach, dear. yes. bed time. [music continues] arthur. i'm ready, arthur. do come along, arthur. jobs. is that the post, dear? yes, dear. anything nice? nothing much. just a postcard. who's it from? i don't know. uh-- it's for you. oh. suit? you're not going to the shop, are you? oh, yes. i think i must today. really? oh, very well. but you will have to make up for it tomorrow. oh, it's from isabelle. do you remember? i sent her that awful vase. oh, arthur. imagine. but for her, we might never have met. off you go. back by six sharp. [music playing] client informs us three months in arrears rent, above mentioned property. unless hear from you by return of post, forced to take immediate action. [music continues] appy! (singsong) appy. (speaking) i'm sure you heard me the first time. i do wish you wouldn't call me appy, dear. but it suits you, dear. you don't have to hang up your clothes, you know. i don't mind. i like things tidy. i know you do, appy dear. (laughs) i don't. come along. [arthur grunting] i'm looking for a distinct improvement tonight. [martha giggling] [clock chiming] your telephone call to mr. gainsborough? yes, appy dear. i don't see why you have to telephone him every night. don't you? i do. martha? hmm? i'd like a glass of water, please. you would? yes. very well, appy dear. [suspenseful music] is that what happened to the others? others? what others? your other three wives, appy. what do you mean? i don't understand. oh surely, you can't forget three wives just like that. unless, of course, i've come to mean so much to you that you can't bear to think about the others. that would be lovely-- i made it quite clear i'd been married before. of course. of course you did, dear. but you didn't say how many times, did you? mr. gainsborough decided, after we were married, to check. everything he found out about you only made you seem, in my eyes, an ideal partner. ideal? mm. the moment i first saw you, i knew you instinctively for what you really were. knew? how could you? i've told you many times. you are the perfect image of my father. in everything, appy. don't call me that. from now on, i shall call you whatever i like. you're insufferably neat, just as he was. priggish and pompous. i hated him all my life for what he was and what he did to my mother. what? married her for her money, made every day a nightmare, and then killed her for what was left of her fortune. killed her? oh. do you imagine you are the only man who's ever been capable of that? yes, appy dear. he killed her. murdered her, if you prefer. using a slip rug on a polished floor, to make it look as if she'd broken her neck. her method strangely similar to your own, is it not? aren't you going to drink your water? what happened to him? mr. gainsborough thinks you know that perfectly well. he thinks you read of the case and copied it. there were new witnesses, of course. but mr. gainsborough was my mother's solicitor. he became suspicious, demanded a hearing. a doctor made it clear in court how my father could have killer her and made it look like an innocent fall. but before a decision could be made, my father died of a heart attack. what has all this to do with us? when he was gone, i swore that i would find a man exactly like him, and make him suffer as my mother suffered. i knew, of course, such a man would only marry me for my money. and i determined he should never see a penny of it until i was dead. and i won't be dead for a long, long time, appy dear. because you're going to care for me until my last possible breath. how can you make me do that, hmm? a man whose wife can send him to the gallows ought to know that, surely. you can't prove anything. three wives, the same methods is too much for coincidence, dear. if i did it three times, i can do it again. ah, but you see, that's where my arrangements come in. arrangements? mr. gainsborough has all the documents about your marriages. the way your wives died, the way you always got the bequest at the right time to pay your shop's debts, and a letter from me saying that in the event of my death, an inquest is to be held immediately. so you see-- - no! yes! you're going to devote yourself to me, arthur appleby, for the rest of your life. you're going to care for and cherish me. and eventually, i may-- i just may hand over the letter or the evidence to you. now, i'm going upstairs. martha? martha! oh, one more thing you must remember is that, if i didn't telephone mr. gainsborough before 9:15 every evening and report that i'm fit and well, he has instructions to ring me. [clock chiming] i'll use the telephone in the bedroom. [phone ringing] ah, there he is! wait. wait. yes? mr. gainsborough (over phone): appleby? yes. mr. gainsborough (over phone): i wish to speak to mrs. appleby. really? well, she can't speak to you just now. what is it? mr. gainsborough (over phone): this is gainsborough, appleby. i'll give you 10 seconds to have your wife at this telephone. do you understand? it's for you. [yelling] [music playing] mr. gainsborough (over phone): the 10 seconds are up, appleby. do you understand? your time is up. [theme music]"

what if the sphere's destruction was allen's actual aim? not escape? i found a small wound at the bottom of jackson's sternum. it's deep. seems to curve through the diaphragm... ...toward the heart. forgive me, friend. my curiosity necessitates opening you up. oh. the track of the wound does lead to the heart. the lungs and heart are shrunken and abnormally pale. completely drained of blood. there's no blood in brady either. jackson, brady... allen. i'm thinking crazy thoughts, nate. i'm thinking... i wonder if all that blood's in allen's stomach. i'll examine him. help me. trapped in this... flesh. starving. what are you? i'm a traveler. - not of earth. - i don't... my true form is small. shape... hideous to you. i feared death. the cave-in. death was your escape. maybe you don't need oxygen. a lesser component of our metabolism. was the sphere... my ship? its destruction is our first duty facing discovery. there was no chance to re-enter. leaving this takes too long. so in the shaft was my only chance. why must your ship be destroyed? we must not be understood. why not? put down the knife. do it now. for we are friends, doctor. livestock must not understand what devours it? oh, fret not. you will understand what devours you. that is essential. i can smell your cancer, doctor. it is delicious. come, let me rid you of it. i will love you. that body will be your coffin. i'll see you buried in it. it's rotten blood. thin nourishment. animating this and synapsing with you is high cost. once you and i are one, i will be near starvation again. but you are a prize host, dr. winters. through you, i can feed even when killing is too dangerous. meals are delivered to you still warm. what the hell are you doing? well, we mustn't raise suspicion. the cut must be forensically correct. have to be careful of the pectoral muscles or i'll lose the use of these arms. why is my arm free? final neural splicing requires a sensory-motor standard to perfect my brain's fit to yours. the rest of you is paralyzed, but once this is done i will unbind you, and we will be free together. you're going to transfer yourself from allen into me? correct. how? well, normally via the alimentary canal. you see, over eons, we have become perfectly streamlined to facilitate our entry into other beings. as a larva, i entered eddie sykes' mouth as he slept. but i've grown since then. oh, how i have grown. we will have to make an incision. you're going to use your puppet there to pluck you out. but once he's dislodged you, won't he go limp and drop you? i am quite more familiar with your physiology than even you, doctor. i know what i can and cannot cut. the most supreme adaptations are purchased at the cost of inessentials. our hosts already carry structures for sight, sound, smell, locomotion. it'd be quite redundant to carry those capacities ourselves. so we travel light. no quaint fins or stalks or feathers terminating in hooks or... suckers or little digits. we've no use for any of it, for we have transcended. have i amused you, doctor? you are truly self-deluded. you're stalling for time. it's already too late. you really don't see it, do you? - see what? - you're jealous. absurd. you have no senses of your own. you have to steal them from others. we have inhabited men for millennia. we have caused great nations to fall. - we have shaped– - you've stolen everything you ever had. you're nothing but a thief and murderer. a parasite. you're pathetic. you're nothing but cancer with a big mouth. your friend, the sheriff, will come soon. sunup, i believe. he will make a fine first meal for us. his flesh will nurture our body, and your anguish as we consume him will nurture my soul. to say nothing at all of his. now where will we begin? you know, it's a curious problem. with careful flensing of the superior and inferior extremities, leaving the primary arteries intact, a man can live for hours. oh, you can harvest meat all the way to the coxal region before he dies. he offers up his pain along with his protein. finally, we can harvest the arteries at our leisure. but of course, the, uh, flesh of the extremities is tough. now aside from the rump, the organs are most toothsome, but bring death much faster. you think about it. let me know which you prefer. either way, as i use your hands to haul forth his smoking entrails, and your mouth to guzzle them down, the repeated orgasms that we will have with your loins will be astounding. you called yourselves our livestock, but you're so much more. i could've eked two weeks out of brady and jackson if that was all. but i reinvested half the energy their blood gave me to keep their brains alive. that way i could whisper directly into their eighth cranial nerves. just to make sure they understood everything that i was doing to them. and eddie sykes? oh, yes. he is here with us right now. mute and powerless as i disembowel him. you're forgetting something. i forget nothing. your arrogance makes you stupid. what have i forgotten, sweet doctor? never mind. i will know every thought in your head in just a few moments, all your memories, your senses. and your fear. your suffering... all mine. all mine. all mine. sykes knew you'd be blind and deaf once you were out of him, you sadistic bastard. oh! here. there must... there must be a way. not to survive, but... what have you done? we're communicating through my eighth cranial nerve now, right? where am i? you are in your new home, but you won't be occupying it for long. there's been some vandalism, i'm afraid. the lights don't work. you'll also find the neighborhood a bit quiet. i can still make you move. we will await your friend's arrival. and when he comes close, i will... i should mention the plumbing has a terminal leak. you only have a few more minutes before i bleed out. i will live. i will live. wouldn't you like to know what you forgot? the whole time you were forcing poor sykes to slice himself up, you were being recorded. no. my tape machine was running. oh no, no, no, no. the tape ran out a while ago, but i'm sure the portion that's left will make for interesting listening when my friend arrives. let me out! carl. this is dr. carl winters, reporting pathologist for the montague county coroner's office. i'm leaving this recording for you alone, nate. my typed report will serve as the official record..."

less than four light years. set a course. nothing? i ran every scan in the book. there's no sign of any intruder anywhere on the ship. maybe our sensors missed something. i went through all the logs for the past 24 hours. to say they were uneventful would be an understatement. this is good news. that i'm imagining things? when you're a little on edge, it's not uncommon to see ""the enemy"" out of the corner of your eye. i thought that was called paranoia. whatever it is, it's not uncommon. just the other night, i thought i heard clicking sounds in my quarters. for a moment i could've sworn there was a xindi-insectoid lurking in the shadows. what i saw wasn't a shadow. all right. i'll keep an eye out. there's some mild vasodilation in the prefrontal cortex... that would account for your headaches. other than that, you're in perfect health. are there any more tests that you can run? what do you expect me to find? the last few days, i've had the strangest feeling that i am being watched. i've heard whispering down corridors... in my quarters. could i have been exposed to something that's making me hallucinate? there's no evidence of any mind-altering substances on board. so basically, this is all in my head. it appears to be. great. i suppose you believe you're dealing badly with stress. it's not a good sign when you start to see things that aren't there. that's a matter of opinion. on denobula, when a person under stress hallucinates, it's considered healthy-- a harmless way for the subconscious to release nervous energy. i've always envied those who had that facility. i tend to keep too much bottled up inside. i should get going. t'pol's asked me to translate a section of the xindi database. hoshi. that's where i'm waiting for you. that's where i'm waiting for you. ensign sato to lieutenant reed. i need help in the command center. - hoshi. - who are you? don't be frightened. hoshi. how did you get aboard? i'm nowhere near your ship. what do you want? you're searching for something. i can help. hoshi... are you all right? i'm not picking up anything out of the ordinary. we still haven't found any ships nearby, or any ""uninvited guests"" on board. i'm not imagining it, captain. you have to admit, it's a possibility. with respect, sir, i know that my mind can be overactive sometimes, but that is not what's happening. this is real! i want you to keep hoshi under observation until we can sort this out. post a security detail outside, and assign teams to engineering and the armory until further notice. are you expecting an attack, sir? around here, you never know. i'll see you both in the morning. isn't it about feeding time? i'll take care of it after i get you settled. would you mind? i'm really not that tired. be my guest. the vulcan root leaf's in the container. that's strange. it's... when the alien communicates with me, it's... it's almost like he's inside my head looking at things through my eyes... experiencing what i'm experiencing. talking to him is like talking to myself. does that make any sense? it makes perfect sense. listening to your thoughts has been very pleasurable. what? i've been with you for several days, studying your mind, your memories-- learning so many things about you. why me? my telepathy only works in rare instances. it takes a unique mind to process it. yours is the first i've found in many years. what do you want? i'm only three light years away. my home is what you're seeing right now. all i want is to meet you. i don't think that'll be possible. i know you're on an urgent mission. that's what i want to talk to you about. what did he tell you about the xindi? he's saving that for my visit. he could've given you something as a show of good faith. this could be another attempt by the xindi to infiltrate enterprise. i think he wants to help. he was horrified that seven million of us were killed. he says he's willing to use his abilities to help us find the xindi. i think that's reason enough to meet with him. - archer to mayweather. - go ahead, sir. we're taking a slight detour. i asked hoshi to come alone. the captain's always a part of first-contact missions. starfleet regulations. i hope that's not a problem. not at all, captain. i'm pleased all three of you could come. my name is tarquin. i'm obviously not what you expected. i didn't want to frighten you, so i created a human image when i contacted you on enterprise. thank you for coming to me. you said you could help us with our mission. you're searching for a weapon that could annihilate your planet. i may be able to find it... but i'll need an object that's associated with the xindi. why? every artifact retains an imprint of the people who made it... who used it... i have the ability to sense those imprints. i could arrange to have something sent down. how much time would you need with it? no more than a few days. we didn't pick up any other bio-signs. i take it you live here alone. alone. it's an awfully big planet for one person. i've lived here for a very long time, mr. reed. my only contact with the outside world has been through telepathy. bring me the artifact. i'd like to get started. we'll be back as soon as we can. captain... one small request. i'd like hoshi to stay with me while i'm working. i'm afraid that's not appropriate. nonetheless... it's a condition of my helping you. if i'm comfortable with this... i don't get the sense that he would harm me. my instincts tell me otherwise. he's hiding something. if he's insistent, we could put off looking for the sphere... stay in orbit. it's only for a few days. the luxury of dealing with one problem at a time anymore, sir. if he can tell us something about the xindi weapon, it's worth the risk. i can take care of myself, captain. this is from the weapon that attacked your planet. we think it was a prototype for a much larger weapon. this will be very useful. - may i? - thanks. - i need a minute. - take your time. do i have to tell you to stay on your toes? i think that falls under the ""goes without saying"" category, sir. did you did bring a phase-pistol? i'll keep it under my pillow. you know how to reach me. do you always eat like this? only when i have company. thank you. i thought you might enjoy something familiar. programming these dishes was a challenge. i had to recreate their tastes and textures from your memory. please. it should approximate the recipe from fiorella's on fountain street in san francisco. you've certainly done your homework. i've enjoyed it. mmm, what's this? dessert. it's a delicacy from the arakon system. i think you'll like it. you know, my stomach is a little unsettled. you told your grandmother that every time she tried to serve you soba noodles. now, it's one your favorite foods. since you seem to know so much about my past, i think it's only fair that i know a little about yours. where are you from? my home world is 30 light years from here. a wonderful place to live... provided you're not born telepathic. the odds are one in 50 million. i was among the unlucky few. we're considered a threat to the rest of the population. there's only one solution for people like me... to live out our lives in exile. so we're sent to places like this. to solitude... i think you're familiar with it. what do you mean? your parents learned you were gifted, so you spent your childhood with private tutors, studying languages. you thought it was normal to go through your days alone. i'm sorry... i forget you're unaware of how much i know about you. are you reading my mind... continuously? not since you've arrived. now that you're here with me, i would rather get to know you the way other humans do. this is great, but i'm pretty tired. of course. if you need anything else, you let me know at supper tomorrow. i'll be working most of the day. feel free to wander. there are a lot of interesting things here. but i strongly suggest that you stay inside. the winds can be treacherous. i'm sure there's enough to keep me occupied. if you'd like, you could spend some time looking at this. it's written in a dead language, over a thousand years old. everything about these people: their homeworld, their culture, has vanished into time. thank you. you don't have to feel alone. i won't. i'll be busy with this. that's not what i meant. you often feel isolated, even around other people. you don't have to. - archer to the bridge. - yes, captain. i assume we're getting close. you assume correctly. take us out  warp. - i'm on my way. - yes, sir status. we're getting reports of anomalies on all decks. breaches on decks b, c and e. emergency bulkheads are in place, but three subsections have decompressed. we're losing structural integrity in the forward hull. all stop! the anomalies are stronger here. if there is another sphere in the region, it's emitting a lot more gravimetric energy than the first one. which means if we continue, there's a good chance this ship is going to get torn apart. if it is there, how far? approximately 75,000 kilometers. it might as well be 75 light years. - bridge to commander tucker. - go ahead. how are your engines holding up? so far so good, but i wouldn't recommend putting them through a lot more of this. how long would it take you to insulate a shuttle pod with trellium-d? i'd need a day to refine enough ore, and, uh, at least 12 hours to reconfigure the hull. get started. aye, sir. hold our position. you might want to steer clear of the launch bay for the next couple of days. indeed. i'm sorry, i didn't mean to disturb you. not at all. please. have you had a chance to look at the book i gave you? i'm about halfway through. i didn't expect you to translate it so quickly. aren't you supposed to know me better than that? and what did you think of it? it's an interesting language. reminds me of medieval klingon. any progress? a few images... impressions. did you know that there are five xindi species? that's what we've heard. there's a great deal of conflict among them. they don't trust one another. do you know where they're building the weapon? not yet. i'm going to need more time. what's this? it helps me extend the range of my telepathy. my family gave it to me when i was exiled. without it, i never would've found you. would you like to try? is that possible? with guidance. if you close your eyes, you'll begin to sense light and color. let the images take shape and let the shapes become more distinct. can you see them? i think so. you're trying too hard to find them. let the images come to you. how do you make sense of all that? it takes practice. try again. maybe later. i should let you get back to your work. feel free to return... if you'd like some company. thanks. i asked you to stay inside! is this why you didn't want me out here? who are they? they're people i knew. the last one died over a century ago. we should go inside. how did they die? very few life spans are as long as mine. how old are you? i was born over 400 years ago. who were they? the first one is morianna taal. she was my first companion. like you, she had a unique mind. and the other three? companions as well. when i lost morianna, i began to search for another... and another. sometimes i don't know what is worse... being alone, or having to bury the people i've come to care about. it's been many years since i found someone like you. you're right, we should go back inside. all i'm asking is that you consider the possibility. you know the enterprise is on an important mission. i just can't abandon my duties. it's possible that with my help, your mission will be over soon. do you really expect me to spend the rest of my life on a desolate world,ith someone that i have known for less than two days? but over time, they came to appreciate what i had to offer them. no one will ever understand you the way i can. i am grateful for your help, and i'm happy to stay here while you work, but i have no intention of becoming your next companion. if you think that projecting yourself as human is going to make me change my mind, you're mistaken. you've let your fear of the unknown stand in the way far too many times. you almost left enterprise early in its mission because you didn't think you could control your fears. but in spite of that, you stayed. it strengthened you. this situation is no different. you obviously misinterpreted a few memories, because this situation is very different. i'm giving you the chance to experience something you searched for your entire life. it's the reason you study languages... to make you make connections with people. i don't need you to help me to do that. then why do you seem so isolated? you live on a ship filled with your own people... and yet there are many times when you feel alone. stay with me. i'll teach you ways of sharing thoughts and emotions no human can. i already told you, i'm not interested. you're lying, hoshi. i can hear everything you're thinking. what i'm thinking is none of your business! michio. your grandfather. he's the last person you were truly close to, but he died a long time ago. leave me alone. you can have that kind of connection again. leave me alone! i know this must seem overwhelming. but think about what i've said. you're going to have a great deal of time. sensors say we're passing through a gravimetric distortion. no anomalies. the trellium seems to be doing its job. - archer to enterprise. - go ahead. we're approaching 79,000 kilometers. still no sign of the cloaking barrier. adjust your heading to 0-1-6-mark-2. stand by. that felt promising. i believe you just grazed the perimeter. turn starboard, 3-point-6 degrees. i think we've found it! maintain course. you should be heading directly toward the cloaking barrier. power's fluctuating. hull integrity? some micro-fractures, but nothing we can't handle. switching to back-up! trip. let's get going with the scans. ah, hell. is there a problem? the sensor relays were damaged. how much time do you need? not long, but we'll have to get back to enterprise. i need to open up the circuit housings on the undercarriage. no way to get to them from the inside. bring the descent thrusters on-line. you're not planning to land on that thing? thrusters, trip. and get the ev suits ready. not exactly my idea of shore leave. get to work. i'm going to take a look around. don't get lost. - how's it coming, trip? - almost there, sir. just two more relays. captain! what happened? the port thruster ignited! i can see that. when i was bypassing the last relay, i must've triggered a surge in the propulsion system. son of a bitch! it's going to be a long time before enterprise decides to come looking for us. can we launch without a port thruster? we can sure as hell try. whoever gets the first clear shot. careful, sir. that was awfully close to the o-2 recycler. i need to spend more time in the armory. - archer to enterprise. - we're here, captain. it was right where you said it was, t'pol. we got all those scans you asked for. captain's starlog, supplemental. while t'pol analyzes the data from the sphere, we've set a course to pick up ensign sato and find out if the alien learned anything about the xindi. may i come in? i won't be long. i just heard from your captain. enterprise will be here in a few minutes. i have learned a great deal about the xindi weapon. i'm sure he'll find the information useful. thank you for all your help. have you given any more thought to my offer? i can't stay here, you know that. i understand. i was foolish to think it was even a possibility. the next time you invite someone for a visit, you might want to let them know that you're looking for a lifelong companion. i won't forget. please keep the book as a reminder of your time here. i was hoping you'd say that. i'm nearly done, and i'm anxious to see how it ends. after i've briefed captain archer, i'll send him to you. it was a privilege knowing you. how was your stay? i'm eager to get back to enterprise. i'm sure. if it's any consolation, your time here was well spent. we've learned more about the xindi than i expected, and he's offered to keep supplying us with information for as long as we're in range, thanks to you. glad i could help, sir. there is one condition. he wants you to stay with him while he continues his work. i assume you told him that wouldn't be possible. i won't order you to do this, hoshi, but it may be our best chance of finding the weapon before it's too late. with any luck, it'll only take a few weeks, maybe a month. we'd come back for you as soon as the mission's over. i don't need to tell you what's at stake, ensign. i'll go back to my quarters to pick up a few things. thank you, hoshi. there's no reason for you to leave. just give me a list of what you need and i'll have it sent down. i should brief my replacement on the u.t. upgrades. we'll take care of it. don't worry. at least give me a chance to say good-bye to the crew. i wish there was time. it won't take long. sir, i might not see my friends again. i'm sure travis will understand. travis? travis and the others. they realize     how important this is. i was just thinking about travis. you're a regular mind reader. we've known each other a long time. where is captain archer? we'll be here for you... as soon as we can. where is he?! hoshi... where is captain archer?! hoshi... open a channel to ensign sato. our signal's not getting through, sir. there's some kind of disruption field. - sir... - what's going on? my station's down. everything's going off-line-- main and auxiliary power, warp engines, life support. nice try. what were you planning to tell my captain when he got back? were you going to appear as me, and beg him to let you stay? no, you can't do that, can you? i'm the only one on board that you can play your tricks with! enterprise has already returned, and their fate is in your hands. what is that supposed to mean? i can't let you leave, hoshi. i've waited too long to find you. what's happened to enterprise? if you agree to stay, they won't be harmed. they'll be free to leave orbit. let me speak to captain archer. that's not possible. why the hell not? you'll be happy here, i promise you. why can't i speak to captain archer? there's no power on your vessel, and there won't be until you agree to remain with me. you would kill over 80 people to keep me here? i don't want to kill anyone. that's why it's essential that you agree to stay. you mustn't do that.  it's very fragile. i'm counting on that. now, undo whatever you've done to my ship, or you will never contact anyone again with this thing! an empty threat, hoshi. as long as you are with me, i won't need to contact anyone else. as long as i'm with you, another 60, 70 years? then what? what'll you do when i'm grave number five out there? without this, you will never find another companion. you will be alone for the rest of your life. please, think of what i can offer you. this is your last chance! report. power's returning to all systems. malcolm? weapons are coming back on-line. - tactical alert. - aye, sir. - it's ensign sato. - put her through. - captain, are you all right? - we are now. what the hell's going on? i think it's time to come get me. captain's star log, supplement ensign sato's returned to enterprise without any new information about xindi i'm hoping t'pol's analysis of second sphere will bring better news what have you got? the data you collected allowed me to create a nearly accurate map of the anamolies. nearly? these are the coordinates where we've encountered strong anamolies. the waves aren't intersecting where they're supposed to. exactly. the locations are being influenced by more than two gravimetric sources. a third sphere... a third sphere would correct some of the error but not all of it. so i had the computer run a covariant extrapolation. how many? we'll need to farther into the expanse to be certain, but... at least 50. 50 manmade spheres, each one the size of a small moon. and each one generating massive amounts of gravimetric energy. did it ever occur to you that whoever built these things may have done it to create the expanse? why would someone want to create a web of crippling anamolies? what are you doing here? did you enjoy the ending? you can't do this. i don't want you watching me. this is the last time. i promise. i've brought you information to give to your captain. why now? you're on a dangerous mission. i don't want to see you harmed. who knows? you may change your mind about me someday. come in. i thought i told you to get some rest. he came to my quarters. i was afraid that might happen. he gave me these coordinates. what are they for? a xindi colony. he said they're building part of the weapon there."
0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"excuse me, i'm looking for ambassador delenn. - could you tell me where to find her? - of course. this way. - shuttle 1 is ready. - any more seismic disturbances? we're still picking up rumbles from further down. i wouldn't bother, but we're in orbit. - best to check it out, just to be sure. - agreed. - shuttle 1, begin geological survey. -confirmed. initiating launch.  i have to go. let me know when the team is back. will do. - ms. winters. - hello, commander. - problem with the transport tube? - no, not really. every time i get into the tube, garibaldi's there, like he knows. mr. garibaldi is many things, but he's not omniscient. - i think i'll take the stairs. - i think i'll join you. range to surface, 40 miles. close enough. activate scanners, set for maximum depth. let's see what's going on underneath. what the hell was that?! - we've lost power. get it back. - i can't, i have no controls here! it was the dawn of the third age of mankind...  ... 1 0 years after the earth-minbari war.  the babylon project was a dream given form.  its goal: to prevent another war by creating a place...  ... where humans and aliens could work out their differences.  it's a port of call,  home away from home...  ... for diplomats, hustlers,  entrepreneurs and wanderers.  humans and aliens,  wrapped in 2,500,000 tons...  ... of spinning metal,  all alone in the night.  it can be a dangerous place.  but it's our last,  best hope for peace.  this is the story of the last of the babylon stations.  the year is 2258. the name of the place is babylon 5. babylon control to shuttle 1. shuttle 1, do you receive? confirmed, we're receiving you.  all of our readouts blacked out. same here. it was some kind of massive power surge, right off the scale. knocked half our systems out. it came from inside the planet. - what's your situation? -controls are fried.  we've achieved orbit, but we can't make it back. - can you send someone? - confirmed. we'll send two starfuries asap. don't go anywhere. don't go anywhere? as if we could. okay, we've got a while to wait. who's got a deck of cards? - you're sure they're all right? -they're shaken, but fine.  -they'll be back in a few hours.  - good. and find out what's going on. - sorry. - it's quite all right. an interesting riddle. i thought the planet was uninhabited. none of our surveys found signs of life down there. perhaps in the past, someone might have lived down there. if that's true, you may have awakened something. perhaps. we'll know more later. now, as far as these new trade routes are concerned... . babylon, this is delta leader.  we have retrieved shuttle crew and are returning to cobra bay.  i want all the equipment loaded: spectral analysis, thermal probes. - we'll reconvene tomorrow. - yes, sir. - dr. tasaki! - lieutenant commander. - what was that? - i have no idea. we were told the planet was safe and uninhabited. - now it appears it isn't. - incorrect. we don't know if anyone's alive there. the seismic activity could've triggered an automatic system. - we'll know more once we go back. - what are you going to do? process the data collected from the power burst... ...then call my wife. she loves mysteries. - this doesn't worry you? - it scares the hell out of me. but, what better way to go out than in the cause of scientific knowledge? is this a multiple-choice question? because i have some ideas. we will release our trade routes to sector 1 1 9... ...provided that our ships are allowed free use of the centauri jumpgate. - you drive a very hard bargain. - it's a fair deal. your government stands to profit substantially. the jumpgate fees are pocket change. what i consider a tent, you consider a pocket. but you are right. it is a reasonable demand. done and done. i will have my government issue an agreement by... ...when? tomorrow this time? what a pleasure to deal with someone reasonable. negotiations are more enjoyable when certain individuals are not here. there is a difference between being unreasonable and being angry. ambassador g'kar is angry, but even the greatest anger fades with time. my dear ambassador delenn, i am sure that for you this is true. but for g'kar and his people, they will do anything to destroy us... ...until the universe itself decays and collapses. if the narns stood in one place, and hated, all at the same time... ...that hatred could fly across light years and reduce centauri prime to ash. - that's how much they hate us. - you don't have to respond in kind. of course we do. it's a natural law. physics tells us for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. they hate us, we hate them, they hate us back... ...and so here we are, victims of mathematics. ambassador. - he never listens. - he will, sooner or later. - how can you be sure? - because the alternative is terrible. without the hope that things will get better... ...that our inheritors will know a world that is richer than our own... ...life is pointless and evolution is vastly overrated. good day, commander. - the signal seems to have diminished. - you sure it's a beacon? we were able to run a few tests. it's a series of regular signals, repeated at specific intervals. we haven't been able to decipher them. - how's dr. tasaki? - he's like a kid with a new puzzle. - he wants to check it tomorrow morning. - a glutton for punishment. i'll authorize it, on the condition that he gets there safely. agreed. i'll take care of that first thing tomorrow. by the way, commander... ...have you heard from mars colony? - no, why? it's always in the earthforce status report... ...but it came in and there wasn't any word from mars. often that's a sign of military exercises, but we'd have been warned. - probably a glitch. good night. - good night, commander. what's the third principle of sentient life? - draal. - incorrect answer. it is the capacity for self-sacrifice. the ability to override evolution and self-preservation... ...for a cause, a friend, a loved one. it has been too long, delenn. you've forgotten your training. soon you will have forgotten all about your old friend draal. not if i live to be 1 001. well then, why would you keep your friend standing out here in this hall? tanker 1 2, are you in position to refuel?  roger, c & c, our hose jockey is ready to connect.  with questions raised about the cost of a presence in space...  ... pol quat of the indonesian consortium, upon leaving a hearing...  ... asked why less affluent nations pay an equal share of the cost...  ... when they do not receive an equal share of the benefits. elsewhere...  we're getting a late-breaking story.  as isn viewers may know, contact with the mars colony has been cut off.  we're now receiving confirmation of a revolt...  ... against the earth government.  we're receiving reports of fighting outside and within the capital city.  troops have moved from syria planum... ... to reinforce patrols in solis planum. we have a live feed from isn reporter derek mobotabwe...  ... relayed from our station on olympus mons. reporting substantial casualties.  death toll may be in the hundreds or higher.  the insurgents struck with heavy weapons...  ... seized in a raid on a reserve military base.  the guerillas, whose ancestors migrated to mars from earth...  ... have demanded independence for the mars colony or:  ""the sand will run red with earther blood. "" governor chakan said...  help me.  help me.  venus team 2, this is environmental control. head to tower 3. got you, environmental control,  we're on our way.  commander. - you heard the news from mars? - i did. it's terrible to see places where i grew up going up in flames. right, you were born on mars. - do you have family there? - no. you? not anymore. - garibaldi's taking it hard. - yeah, i figured. i'll try to check on him later. - you all right, commander? - i don't know. last night, just before i went to bed, i saw a... . - what? - i don't know. maybe i'm just tired. - what's the status on epsilon 3? - they leave in a few hours. good. keep me informed. damn. have i thanked you for arranging for my quarters? - and for the fine meal this morning? - yes, you have. good. then i need not do so again. - have i told you about rathenn? - yes, you have told me of rathenn. of all of my teachers and many of my family. you've told me everything, except why you're here. what is there to tell? i have lived my entire life on minbar. - now i am seeing what is out here. - yes. a curious answer from one who taught me... ...that a half-truth is the worst kind of lie. our world is changing, delenn. i'm not sure when it began. perhaps the war, perhaps the death of dukhat. perhaps the darkness was always there and we refused to see. the division between the religious and military castes...? that, and more than that. there is a sense that we are lost, drifting. in the streets, in the temples, you can hear it in their voices. an anger beneath the surface, a dissatisfaction... ...a self-involvement above the needs of others. it is not the same world i was born in, delenn. not the same world at all. i am going to the sea. draal. no, you're too young to go to the sea. there's much you could do back home. i don't know what good it would do. better to find a place out there in the sea of stars... ...where i can be of service before the end. i hear the call of the stars, delenn, and i must answer. then, when you leave here... ...i will never see you again. i'm afraid so. which is why we should enjoy our time together, delenn. don't look so sad. this should be a time of great joy. my feet are firmly on the path and the road beckons me down to the sea. i will find the purpose and meaning that i have lost among my own people. be glad, delenn. be glad. when... . when do you have to leave? not for a while. we have time. we have seen little of one another these last few years... ...and there is much that i want to hear. then i will talk and talk and talk until you fall asleep from the sound. and i will be glad of it. and i will dream of the sea. what do you mean you can't get through? communication is out except for authorized people.  i'm an earthforce officer, clearance level ultraviolet alpha... ...and i'm not authorized? -lf you try again later...  i've tried all morning! now, all i'm asking for is one clear channel. i'm sorry, mr. garibaldi.  there's nothing we can do until after the blackout.  i'll file your request, and if things change, i'll notify you at once.  we'll provide fighter support in case of trouble. - don't take any chances. - we won't. get your readings, make a scan of the surface and get out. - we'll be monitoring your progress. - good. anything else? the starfuries are designed for combat in space, not inside an atmosphere. - drop too low or you're on your own. - understood. all right, move it out. we've got a mystery to solve. - ivanova to sinclair. -sinclair.  - they're on their way. - i'll be there. - lf you'll excuse me... - yes, yes, i know. what will you do if you find anything of value down there? the odds of that are small. it's probably an old automated beacon. yes, but if it isn't, will you tell me? no. just making sure we know where we stand. survey 1, hold at coordinates 7 by 1 3 and await escort. - escort standing by. - launch fighter escort. delta 6, this is delta leader.  let's be awake out there.  roger that, delta leader,  i'm on his tail.  - thank you. see you next month. - see you then. thank you. - i need to talk. - tube out of order? wait! look, i'm sorry, but i need your help. - as lines go, that's not original. - it's not a line, damn it, i... . can i just have five minutes? please? okay. i appreciate you taking the time. this is important to me. before i came to babylon 5, my job was working security on mars colony. the job wasn't great, we got flack from earthdome, but... ...one thing made it worth all the grief. her name's lise hampton. we met a few days after i got there and we got involved. - it sounds serious. - it was. we even talked about marriage a few times. but i was... look, i was messed up. after being fired from four jobs, i had something to prove. so when i came to babylon 5, i asked her to come with me. she said no. we argued and i said a lot of stupid things. the kind that can haunt you. the last time we spoke it ended with a slammed door and me flying out. we haven't talked since then. for the past two years, i've wanted to call her, needed to call her, but... ...i didn't know if she'd want to hear from me. and now this. - talia, i need to know she's okay. - i sympathize, mr. garibaldi. i hope you realize that. but what do you expect me to do? if you can't... psi corp's got an intelligence operation in syria planum.  how did you know? that's classified. that's never stopped me before. they've got a relay to get me into the local com-net. - you're asking a lot. - lf there were another way, i'd do it. i can't sleep not knowing if she's okay. you're my last hope. all right. i can't promise anything, but i'll do what i can. thanks. survey 1 to babylon control,  beginning our final run.  initiating drop to five kilometers inside the atmosphere. do not enter atmosphere. the fighters won't be able to follow. don't worry, i'm not going far. just enough to get samples. you can't expect us to come this... there's something coming our way, fast. take evasive action! get us out of here! - too late, we've got lock-on. - hang on! aft stabilizers hit! forty-percent power loss! full power! one more like that and we've had it! incoming! - escort, can you reach the shuttle? -negative, babylon control.  fighters, target guns on lower atmosphere, wide-angle fire. - what the hell are you doing? - firing will distract the missiles. hit your afterburners. they won't follow you out of the atmosphere. we won 't have enough fuel!  the fighters will tow you back. do it, before the missiles lock on! survey 1 to babylon, we're clear.  returning to base.  confirmed. upon arrival you will report for debriefing. on your trip back, take the time to learn the babylon 5 mantra: ivanova is always right. i will listen to lvanova. i will not ignore lvanova's recommendations. ivanova is god. and, if this happens again, lvanova will rip your lungs out! babylon control out. civilians. i'm just kidding about that god part. no offense. our scans failed to show any automatic systems on the surface... ...or for a depth of two miles. - those missiles came from somewhere. - agreed. and i think we've solved the mystery. we didn't go deep enough. here. this is a computer scan of sector 1 4. we snared it before we were fired on. - i don't see anything. - not yet. increase magnification. there. that's one of the first missiles fired at us. it came from underground. - is that fissure natural or artificial? - my guess is it's artificial. it was probably opened by one of the quakes. it's possible this is an old automatic defense system. - yes. - how deep is that fissure? that's interesting. our analysis suggests the missile was fired five miles within the planet. there's something there important enough to require a defense system. very good. thank you, doctor. analysis? we don't know what weaponry may be there... ...so i'd consider it a threat to our security. same here. it's also a potential first-contact situation. i'd say we have to check it out. wouldn't you agree? absolutely. and he says, ""goulash. "" do you get it? i'll get you yet. mr. garibaldi, off duty, i see. water. fascinating. i never touch the stuff myself. kat, the usual. - is there something i can do for you? - yes. attend. as a young centauri, i developed a preoccupation with females. i went to all the finest clubs, watched exotic centauri dancers. now, one day, i was angry and upset. but i went to the club, i sat, watched the show. but never saw it. i just sat and stewed. suddenly, i looked up and this beautiful dancer... ...is leaning down over the stage and looking right into my eyes. and she said: ""whatever it is, it can't be that bad. "" and then she kissed me... ...right here. mr. garibaldi... ...whatever it is, it can't be that bad. you try and kiss me and i'll break your arm. we're not that close, mr. garibaldi! - and the dancer? - i married her. - no. - yes! that day! the next day i woke up, i saw her sleeping against my arm... ...and i decided i would rather chew off my arm than wake her up. - that's sweet. - no, no. she had a voice that could curdle fresh milk. ""londo! "" ""yes, dear?"" ""londo! "" ""coming, my darling. "" ""i'll be right there, my love bug. "" - you looked as if you needed a friend. - i did. thanks. you're welcome. now i go to spread happiness to the rest of the station. it's a terrible responsibility, but i have learned to live with it. hey! somebody better pay for that drink. help me.  help me.  all right, delta flight, we're ready to go in. target a 1 0-kilometer area with long-range bursts... ...to draw off incoming fire. -confirmed, shuttle 1. - system ready. engines to maximum burn. - hit it. temperature up 200 degrees. - missile sighted. - delta flight, fire. let's hope that fissure is five miles deep. - why? - it's going to take two miles to stop. - assuming we don't hit anything. - a hell of a time to think of that. lights. - decelerating. - two miles. two point five. three. - anterior thrusters, half power. - thrusters, aye. - anything? - just rock. 3.5 miles. 4 miles. slowing descent 30% . four point five. we've got something. it's an opening. definitely artificial. bring us in. coming into a landing grid. environment check. gravity.75 of earth normal. atmosphere 90%  carbon dioxide, 1 0%  trace elements. - we'll need those breathers. - life signs? none. we're the only living things in or on this planet. all right, let's check it out. i'm sorry, but there's nothing i can do.  to preserve our confidential status,  access is confined to psi corps.  we can 't let anyone outside the government know the center exists.  - mr. garibaldi already knows. -he may suspect...  ... but that is not confirmation.  for all we know, this request...  ... is a cover to confirm our location and pass that information to others.  - that's completely paranoid. -possibly.  but with fighting a mile from the facility...  ... we're entitled to some paranoia.  - how is it back there? -not good.  the free mars movement has been growing...  ... but no one suspected they were this organized, or well armed.  i can 't plug your friend into the com-net...  ... but i can run a check and see if she's listed among the wounded.  - that would help. thank you. -no promises, but i'll do what i can.  pcc relay out.  commander. wait. well, that'll cut down on tourism. one, two, three, four. one, two, three. - a three-second recharge before firing. - looks like it. - can you cover that in three seconds? - not a problem. stand by. go! get down! - you okay? - yeah, fine. commander, you'd better take a look at this. holy... . commander? yeah? i think i've got to go to the bathroom. tell me about it. come. delenn, what can i do for you? i was taking my friend on a tour and thought i'd introduce you. draal, this is ambassador londo mollari of the centauri republic. ambassador mollari, this is draal, for many years, my mentor and teacher. - i am honored. - thank you. - i hope we are not intruding. - no, i was doing a little studying. yes, earthers. i try to find out as much as i can to make sense of them... ...but it never seems to come together. they seem to be a mass of contradictions. exactly my point. here, 6000 years of recorded history. a history that includes remarkable composers, astonishing symphonies... ...but what is the one song that half of them sing to their children... ...generation after generation? it doesn't mean anything. i've been studying it for seven days. i had the computer analyze it. i swear to you, it does not mean a thing! we've come at a bad time, haven't we? no, not at all. here, sit. i'll make some hot jala. - i rather enjoyed the song. - don't tell him. - you're sure? - trust me. try to raise the shuttle again. nothing. we still can't get through. damn. two hours. mr. garibaldi, can i see you for a moment? i've had some news. - yell if they link in. - yes, sir. well? they won't give you access. they're not happy you know about the center. it's an imperfect universe. - is that all you've got for me? - no, it isn't. i asked them to check for any information. they were able to access the list of survivors. - and? - her name isn't on it. they can't find her name. either she's not on mars... she had a life there. she wouldn't have left all that. then it's possible something's happened to her. - yeah? -mr. garibaldi, we've got a signal.  i'm on my way. i'm sorry. don't be. she's all right. she has to be. that's all there is to it. it must be 1 0, 20 miles deep.  - commander? you okay? -we're fine.  michael, you wouldn 't believe it.  incredible.  a whole new area of technology.  machines as big as buildings...  ... all around us.  - what's happening? - seismic activity. it's big. get the hell out of there! commander! jeff! lvanova! we've lost them. - commander, you all right? - yeah, i think so. we're going to have to find another way out of here. this light's had it. - what the hell? -help me. please help me.  - you saw it too? - yeah, and on the station. commander. help me... ...or your people, all your people, will die. you must help me. help me get him out of this. we don't have time. we're cut off from the entrance. we need to leave before we're out of air. - we can't leave him like this. - i know. it's a russian thing. when we do something stupid, we like to catalog it for future reference. -shuttle 1 to babylon, do you read?  - jeff, yeah. - what's your situation? -we're coming out.  initiate air cover and have a medical team standing by. initiating air cover. i want that med team at bay 1 4. i'll meet them there. - we've got a ship coming through. - fine. mr. garibaldi, it's big. what the hell?

"
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"good evening, ladies and gentlemen. i'm making a gift for a dear friend. it's a going-away present. it's also in the nature of a surprise, since he isn't aware the trip is being planned for him. this is peculiar. i'm cutting along the dotted line. oh, well, i don't really need anything fancy. i'm only gonna chain it to his feet. and now, ladies and gentlemen, we present our story, ""backward, turn backward."" hey, sheriff, when's the hanging? nice turnout. saul, you're a chemist. tell me something. how is it people can smell blood a mile away? no, they can't. but they do. every time. look at them. good, honest, god-fearing vultures! don't be too hard on them, andy. all they want is... all they want is phil canby's head for dinner. you going to give it to them? i don't know. what'd you find? nothing. it's just about the cleanest job i ever saw. what about this? oh, it's the murder weapon, all right. but i can't tell you much more than that. why not? well, see for yourself. pick it up. go on. now smell it. laundry soap? yup. he scrubbed it in the sink. then he washed out the sink. you've got to hand it to old canby, he's a neat murderer. now you listen to me, saul! phil canby isn't a murderer until a jury says so. you understand? a jury! i haven't even arrested him yet. you wanted to see me, andy? yes. now, miss lyons, i know you mean well, and i'm grateful for the help you've been to us. but i'm going to have to ask you to hold your tongue about this, until we make an arrest. i'm sure i don't know what you're talking about. you've been telling people that you knew something terrible was going to happen. well, it's the truth. and the truth never hurt anybody, did it? i'm not so sure. anyway, something terrible did happen, before all this. and everybody knows it, too. phil canby chasing after a girl young enough to be his granddaughter. do you know what i saw? i saw phil canby take sue thompson in his arms and kiss her. right on the mouth! made me sick to my stomach! why? ""why?"" oh, andy, phil canby's 60 years old! he's 59! besides, the way i hear it, he offered to marry her and she accepted. but that makes it even worse. the very idea! a girl still in her teens marrying an old fool like that! is that why you all want to see him hang? because you think he's an old fool? would you like your daughter to marry a man of 59? were you in love with matt thompson? i certainly was not! i liked matt well enough, and i felt sorry for him, all alone in this big old house. not exactly alone. he had his daughter sue. a lot of good she was! you'd think that girl could at least keep this place clean. who took care of sue when she was a baby after her mother died? her father. and when he was working? oh. i don't know. from what i've heard, you were very good to both matt and sue in those days. i was only doing my duty, helping out. i've heard rumors that you expected matt to propose to you. is that true? whoever told you such a silly thing? are you prepared to swear that you heard the murray baby crying last night? i most certainly am. at 10:30? that's right. you're sure? it couldn't have been some other child? hardly. there isn't another baby in the whole block. and i knew it was 10:30 because i looked at my clock when i got home. why'd you do that? i always do. that was when you heard the baby crying? yes. you know, phil canby swears the baby was asleep at that time. and never cried once. that's ridiculous! i never heard him like that before, rasping for breath. he kept it up all the time i was getting ready for bed. all right, miss lyons. you can go on home now. well! isn't there anything i can do? no, i think you've done just about enough. we'll call you. the ambulance is here, andy. can we haul it away? yeah. hey, here comes the sheriff! you gonna arrest him now? oh, sheriff, come in. is your father here? yes. he's upstairs, i think. with sue thompson? i'm sorry. philip, darling, i'm coming. yes, mommy's here. it's all right, darling. mommy's here now. and i'll have your lunch in just a moment. he's at that certain age. i know. i had the same trouble with mine. now, now, young fellow, what's the matter? quiet! you certainly have a way with children. with this one, i do. couldn't rightly say about any others. have you got anything more to tell me, phil? nothing more to tell. they're all blaming him for it, aren't they? why? what's wrong? he worked for those people. he loved them. he was their friend. why are they all suddenly turning on him like this? don't you know? yes, i suppose i do. but it's not right, sheriff. you can't condemn a man for murder just because you don't approve of what he's doing! i'm not condemning your father, betty. i'm only trying to get at the truth. you've gotta believe that. i've told you all i know, andy. what's the point in going on about it? it's not a matter of point, phil. it's routine. you don't mind if i ask sue a few questions, do you, phil? not if she don't. sue, sheriff here wants to talk with you. yes, sir? sue, i'm going to speak straight out to you. a lot of people think that phil canby is responsible for your father's death. that's silly! maybe so, but that's the way it is. do you think he's responsible? doesn't make any difference what i think. now, sue, i'm going to ask you a few questions. i want you to tell me what happened last night, just the way you remember it. and don't leave anything out. go ahead, tell him. it's all right. we got nothing to be afraid of. i don't know what to say. last night you asked phil over to your house to fix the drain. is that right? yes, sir. what happened? phil was fixing the drain. we were talking about our plans. daddy came in and then he started to yell and say awful, terrible things. what things? he said he'd have me put in an institution before he'd see his daughter married to an old man. let her tell it, phil. then what, sue? phil yelled something back at him, it scared me. i hid in the pantry and put my fingers in my ears. when did you come out of the pantry? when daddy told me to. he said it was all over and i could go to bed now. phil was gone? yes, sir. i went upstairs and went to sleep. all right. phil, i've got to talk to you now. alone. go upstairs, honey. this won't take long. you rest some. nice girl. ain't a girl. she's a woman. the best i've seen in a long time. phil, there's no sense pretending. you're in trouble. miss lyons says she heard little philip crying at 10:30 last night. your daughter admits you didn't change the baby. now, that isn't like you, phil, neglecting him. he was asleep. i didn't want to wake him up. matt thompson was killed between 10:00 and 11:00. you say you were here at that time, babysitting, while betty and her husband went to the show. you had the radio turned on. that's right. i came home right after the quarrel at 9:00. everybody knows that when you're here, that baby's quiet. yet miss lyons heard him crying at 10:30. don't you see what that means? i never touched matt! all right, you never touched him! who did? don't know. and i don't rightly care. state's attorney's going to say that baby was crying because you weren't here to keep him quiet. he's going to say that you got to thinking about matt thompson's threats. you couldn't stand it anymore. so, you went back and killed him. you even left the wrench behind. i was using that to fix the drain. i forgot it. forgot it! why'd you wash it with laundry soap? i didn't. phil, you've got to give me something more to go on! i'd go all the way for you, if you'd just give me some proof that you didn't kill matt. anything. anything. andy. you think i did it, don't you? what else can i think? phil, this whole town's against you. you don't give me something more to go on, you're going to hang. phil, when did you first fall in love with sue thompson? fall in love? sounds funny, saying that about somebody my age, don't it, andy? i don't rightly know. whatever it was, it happened last spring. i was working in the yard and kinda keeping an eye on little philip at the same time. sue come over to watch, like she always did. she wasn't no different, i guess. all big-eyed and sad like a doe. like a big-eyed, sad little doe, ready to run if you made a wrong move. but she was different, somehow. i'd been seeing her ever since she was a child, but now it was like i was seeing her for the first time. i never seen such an expression on her face before. like she wasn't a little girl no more, but a woman. and she wasn't just outside the yard, but outside the world, looking in. i'd tried to fool myself into thinking that i just felt protective towards her. but it weren't so. i was in love with her. i am in love with her. she makes me feel young. and i haven't felt that way for 20 years. disgusted, andy? i just wish the two things could be separated. you and sue and matt thompson's murder. they can't be separated. if they hang me, it won't be for murder. it'll be because i fell in love with a 19-year-old girl. what's that about? nothing. how's it going? it isn't. what about the drain? well, there are wrench marks on it, but i don't know what that proves. harris is here. where? upstairs. miss thompson, your father was murdered last night. now i'm going to find out who did it and why! so you'd better tell me the truth. i am telling you the truth. do you mean to tell me that you didn't expect your father to interfere with your marriage to an old man like phil canby? he never interfered with anything i did. and don't you know that he told betty murray that he would chain you up rather than see you marry canby? he never said that to me! oh, what did he say when you told him? i think he said something like, ""well, doesn't that beat everything!"" and he laughed. are you taking over my job, mr. harris? it's not a bad idea, andy. seeing that sheriffs do have all the fun. first on the scene, first to make an arrest. sue, mr. harris and i have some talking to do. why don't you run on back? i told you i'd let you know when i was ready. and aren't you? look, andy, i've been getting a lot of calls. now i understand your feelings in this matter, and i sympathize in a way. but the press is getting impatient. what they want is an arrest. and if you can't give them that... and personally, i can't understand why not. at least tell them you have a suspect under surveillance. or would you rather have that mob out there take things into its own hands? i'll take care of it. good. what's worrying you, andy? there's enough in here to nail canby to the ground. i know. you ought to. you put it together for me. so, why are you stalling? look, thompson threatens canby, makes things unpleasant. canby flies into a rage and beats out thompson's brains with a wrench. later, he cleans up and goes home. opportunity, motive, no alibi. it all seems so obvious, andy. i know! i know! and what's his defense? he was home babysitting. now who's gonna believe that after miss lyons testifies she heard the baby screaming its head off? all right! i'll make the arrest, after the funeral. is that soon enough for you? andy, do me a favor. don't mix me up with those wolves outside. i'm after canby because i think he's guilty. and i think that because of this evidence you've given me. and to thy charge, beloved lord, we dispatch the immortal soul of matthew wallace thompson. in his life upon this earth, matthew was a gardener, tending for the loveliest of thy creations, the flowers. so, in a way, it is fitting that he should at last return to the soil from whence his beloved roses sprang. he was a good man. he never missed a sunday at church from the age of seven to the time of his cruel and hasty death. but he has not truly died, as thou dost well know. he has but gone from this world to another, and as we think of him now, reunited at last with his loved ones, for all eternity, we lift our hearts in joyous anticipation of that dark, mysterious journey which awaits us all. hello, john. sheriff. the old man, huh? better take your wife upstairs, john. you, too, sue. i'm not leaving. this is my father's house. and i don't have to leave if i don't want to. all right. phil canby, i'm arresting you for the willful murder of matt thompson. oh, you're crazy! my father never killed anybody. my father would never kill anybody. honey, it isn't gonna help. there's nothing we can do. let's go, phil. you can't take him away! he'll be given a fair trial. don't lie to her, andy. if i can be arrested for something i didn't do, i can be hung for it. let's get it done with. you can take some things if you want. oh, i've no things. and how do you feel now? that's right. you, sue thompson. it's all your fault. every single bit of it. if you hadn't led my father on like this, he never would have gotten into all this trouble! you're just a... betty! leave her alone! i won't! i won't! she did this to you. she made you lose all your friends, all your self-respect. now she's sending you to jail! she doesn't care! that's what miss lyons heard. what will they do with her? what they do with all sick people, i expect. put her in a hospital. do you think she knows she killed her father? no, i don't think she has any idea she killed him. we have run out of entertainment. until next week, that is. i have a new piece of stone and have decided to give sculpturing one more try. oh, well, what can you expect from a beginner? good night."
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[theme music] [music playing] narrator: november in connecticut, the last glories of an indian summer are about to give way to winter. a young girl is showing a visitor around the grounds. i come to the country to get back in touch with nature-- the fields, the forests away from all those false trappings of civilization, thunder in the mountains, lightning in the black of midnight. the wilderness howls, and something in me howls with it. i'm one with the primal chaos. is that walt whitman? you like the country? i hate the country. i like poetry. if you hate the country, then why do you come here? because i have to. i'm sorry. this is a bad day. no, i'm sorry. shall i go? oh, it doesn't matter. it's gonna be a bad day no matter what. i might as well have some company. well, indoors has its pleasures, too-- a crackling fire, a book of verse to stir the soul, fine brandy to warm the innards. hello. ah, civilization beckons. thank you, vernon. i wonder if mother is down yet. it's really cool in here. shall i get those windows? let them stay open, please. oh, excuse me, i didn't realize. i thought i heard voices earlier. how do you do? jane didn't tell me that she was expecting guests. i came unannounced. my name is gregory sadler. i'm staying at the pollock's. they left me your name and suggested that i call. jane, you should have told me that mr. sadler was here. oh-- gregory, please. the least we could do is offer you some refreshment. vernon took it away almost as soon as he brought it in. show a little respect, young lady. vernon goes a long way back in this family. oh, jane is taking great care to entertain me. jane gets lonely in the country. don't you, darling? well, there's no need to sulk and pout. my goodness, any smart young lady would give anything in the world to spend a week at leisure in this house. well, you no choice in the matter, anyway. this is a very special day. you realize that, don't you, jane? yes, mother. marjorie: it's a ritual, an annual ritual that means a great deal to me. excuse me, my headache is killing me. i've got to get an aspirin. you know you're expected to dress for dinner, jane. yes, mom. nice to have met you, mr.-- um, gregory. i'm sure. she hates me. gregory: oh, i'm sure that's not true. what's this ritual she's talking about? it sounds fascinating. it's not. it's something i'd rather not talk about, ok? well, i'd much rather talk about you. well, tell me more about yourself. unless i'm wrong, you're still in school. no choice. gregory: you don't like it? oh sure, i love wearing a white blouse, and a blue sweater, and a gray flannel skirt to my knees. do you play obsession? a uniform? your school still has uniforms? knee socks and tie shoes. right up until graduation. do you want to play? oh, i don't know that game. what about othello? ok. well, i'm sure you get a very good education for all that. i'd much rather travel. i have friends in paris and istanbul. [music playing] really? jane: mm, i'll go see them. i'll go live there. i'm not surprised school seems dull, given your cosmopolitan perspective. oh, oops, i-- i didn't do that very well, did i? well, i find ways to amuse myself. i have friends. we get together-- biding my time until i get free. look, could we play instead of talking? could we talk instead of playing? sure. what about you? what do you like to do? oh, my life wouldn't interest you very much. sure, it would. how old are you? 31. i'm a teacher, or at least i used to be. college? uh, the last place was rather like your school, or so it sounds. girls school? girls, yes. so, that's how you know about knee socks. my subject was english poetry. she knew the lifelong martyrdom, the weariness, the pain, the waiting for a man to come who ne'er would come again-- and so on and so forth. it's longfellow. i know. i though there was something poetic about you. when you were talking about the wilderness and wild animals, i could feel your passion. what are you drawing? - never mind. - oh, come on. show me. let me see. no, not yet. [music playing] why did you leave? what? school. uh, a slight misunderstanding-- jane: hm? nothing, really. say, uh, i graduated. what are you doing here in the country? i am spending a very special afternoon with you. i mean, what are you doing here at all? why are you here at all and not somewhere else? not-- i don't know. for the very same reason that you are, i suppose. you have no idea why i'm here. gregory: tell me. because of her. gregory: your mother? yes. what's the trouble with her? why does she talk to you the way she does? why did she spend all afternoon upstairs? what's going on here? what's the matter with everybody? it's the anniversary. your mother and father? no, not that. she divorced him years ago. why? he was gentle and poetic. she said he was weak. what is today? apparently it's something special in this house, and i've come at the wrong time. it's the first day of the hunting season. my mother's second husband, my stepfather, kept this house for sporting purposes, or so he said. gregory: i don't understand. i suppose you may as well know. it's her secret, not mine. he loved to hunt, grouse especially. every year on the first day of the hunting season, he set out at the crack of dawn to shoot birds. oh, my mother would kill me. i won't tell a soul. i hope to die. - that's not the point. it was three years ago. he had a son, stanley. ever since stanley there was a little boy, they went hunting together. he adored my stepfather, looked just like him, acted like him, they even dressed alike. that day, my mother and i stood there and watched them tramp across that field into those woods. chase, our dog, had a special little bell, so they could always tell where he was. we could hear it as they went. they had shotguns and enough provisions for the day. we didn't expect them home till late afternoon. they always tried to get the limit. my mother went upstairs to rest. i don't remember what i did. [music playing] [bell ringing] [sniffing] [bell ringing] [gun shot] marjorie: some time later, i remember hearing shots. but i'm not sure. then, i know i heard a dog howling. my mother heard it, too. she came downstairs with a worried look on her face. it was already 5:30. they weren't home yet. was there an accident? we tried to piece it together later on. nobody knows for sure. it happened at the far edge of those woods. maybe my stepfather wanted one more bird. [music playing] maybe he just heard a noise in the brush. [bird sounds] or maybe he stumbled. at any rate, he fired. [gun shot] there was a cry-- a human cry. he dropped his gun, and he ran. while stanley, dead. my stepfather knelt down. imagine his feelings. he'd killed his only son. my mother and i knew there was something wrong when the men didn't come home on time. we sent the gardener out to check. but nobody could believe it when he came back weeping 40 minutes later and said that he found chase whimpering over two dead bodies. my stepfather had killed himself. my mother couldn't take it in. they carried the bodies in canvas sacks right below that open window. my mother stood there and didn't see them. she gazed across the field into the woods, sure that they would appear at any moment-- still alive, decked with game and caked with mud, tramping towards us crying, crack the ice! we're home! that was their great joke, ice for drinks. crack the ice! we're home! that's a terrible story. now you know. today is a very special occasion. you know, gregory, grouse hunters are a very dedicated lot. some people might even think they're insane, all that waiting around and so little to show for it. but when you marry into a household like this, you have to learn to cope. you know, to-- to rise to the occasion and catch a little of excitement. i have. jane, of course, has not. oh, yes. my husband, stuart, and his son, stanley, loved to hunt. it's all they ever talk about-- mad for it, in face. they've been out all day now, but they'll be back soon-- coming out of those woods across that field, covered with mud and gore, and grinning from ear to ear. you know, it's them when you hear the dog's bell. and then you'll hear their great cry. crack the ice! we're home! thirsty for drinks, you see. crack the ice! we're home! why don't you stay for dinner? oh no, i couldn't. well, the pollocks were kind enough to leave our name. you were nice enough to use it. the least we can do is look after you. oh, i really wouldn't want to put you to any bother. oh, it's no bother at all. we can always find room for another one for dinner. uh, jane-- i see you've made quite a hit with jane. mother, how can you? what? never mind, i'm in a party mood. every now and again, i enjoy the company of men like you, gregory. you have a certain air about you. stuart and stanley would be so sorry to miss you. you mustn't disappoint them. the first day of the hunt is such a thrill. they come home full of excitement. they love an audience to regale with their adventures. it's settled. i'll go tell the cook. [music playing] - what's wrong with her? - what can i do? she's my mother. she'd be lost without me. she's lost already, believe me. i've got experience in these matters. i know more than you think. leave her before she pulls you down with her. what? come away with me now, this afternoon. that's crazy. don't be shocked. it's your only hope. seize this chance while you've got it. i understand what you're going through, and i want to help. but run away? i was in a situation just like this. when i was teaching, i felt cornered, trapped. the pressure was insane. only, i didn't have your chance to escape, so i cracked from the pressure. jane: you what? i had a nervous breakdown. oh my god. well, it doesn't show because i've had extensive treatment. that's why i've come to the country, to have a peaceful, quiet place to stay. when i get out of the-- well, for the past year, i've been in an institution. you mean you're really sick? was, please-- i'm better now. i tell you this because of what you told me so that you'll understand that i know what you're going through and can help. it began with these tension headaches. what i needed was good physical exercise, and i wasn't getting it. the problem was that i couldn't sleep. but i'm over that. jane: what about the headaches? they're gone. it was only with all that girlish laughter, that hubbub. but i'm afraid my teaching suffered. that's why i left. my best girls, seniors, came to me after class for clarification. i wasn't being clear. i had always been known for my utter clarity and precision. i don't understand. why did this happen? it's not important. it's over. look, you can see it. i'm fine, no signs of strain. my doctors are proud of me. you need my help. i can't run away with you. i'm too young. but you said yourself you hate this house. your mother is out of her mind. school has nothing to offer you. i can teach you so much more. we'll get away tonight. i'm sick and tired of this awful country. this peace and quiet is driving me crazy! all those trees! that red and gold, awful! we'll travel-- london, paris, even istanbul. you name it, we'll go there. don't even bother to pack. i'll buy you new clothes. you'll be safe with me. you'll be happy with me. quick, before your mother comes back, say yes. i don't know what to say. um-- i'm very sorry. i meant it, but i am really, very sorry. [clock chimes] marjorie: all set! what? cook says we have plenty to eat. we'll set another place. oh, yes-- dinner. dinner? i've got to go upstairs and change. well, you've certainly had a wonderful effect on that young lady. that's the first time i've ever heard her volunteer to go and change without my insistent complaining. really, she provokes me into being such a shrew. and i'm not. really, i'm not. you know, i think she's a little infatuated with you. oh, i hadn't considered that. marjorie: no, of course you have. you're an adult, mature. she's still a child. tell me about yourself, gregory. who are you? oh, there's nothing much to tell. where do you live? nowhere, really. yes, of course, but you must have an address. i spent the last year in switzerland. really? how marvelous. skiing? gregory: oh, no, no, no, nothing like that. i should say resting. marjorie: oh, you lucky man. i keep saying to my husband, stuart, we-- we really must get away for a long, long vacation together, just the two of us. but unfortunately, he hasn't been able to get away the last three years. [startled gasp] uh, thank you, vernon. what did you do before you went abroad, gregory? it's not important. don't be shy. you've piqued my curiosity. i was a teacher, english poetry. she knew the lifelong martyrdom, the weariness, the pain-- and so on and so forth, longfellow. no wonder jane is infatuated with you. my first husband, her father, was the poetic type-- all sighs and moving glances, no time for the basic bedrock of getting and spending that makes the world go round. she's never forgiven me for divorcing her father. gregory: yes, she mentioned something about it. she said that you had been rather under a strain. did she? that little witch. i wish she'd come down. of course i didn't mean that the way it sounded. it's perfectly natural for her to love her father and take a passing fancy to you. but i need her. she's growing up too fast. i respect her true essence. i couldn't stand that. maybe we should change her school. gregory: or take her out of school altogether. to run wild? absolutely not. though a change is possible, perhaps her school is too rigid. what about your school? are you going back there? i don't know. i-- i couldn't say. [music playing] oh, it's going to be a magnificent sunset. dinner after the first day of the hunt is always such a feast. with any luck at all, they'll come across that field absolutely covered in dead birds. first time i saw them, i was in shock, i can tell you. i thought, what have i married? my husband, looking like some kind of savage all covered in blood and feathers. [door creak] [startled gasp] i've got to get out of here. of course not, you're staying for dinner. i can't. please, come with me. but we've all through that, gregory. we're going to have such fun. please, i can't handle this by myself. [bell ringing] listen-- there they are now! vernon, come and help! [music playing] [bell ringing] [startled gasp] [bell ringing] [bird screech] oh-- crack the ice! we're home! stanley: crack the ice! we're home! uh-- [laughing] [bell ringing] [bird screech] [music playing] good evening, vernon. good even, vernon. at last. my, don't you two look a sight. gregory, come meet the hunters! jane, where's gregory? what's a matter with that man? he was supposed to stay for dinner. it was chase, mother. i should have warned him. gregory was terrified of dogs. he told me he was walking with the girl in the country once, and they were attacked by a pack of wild dogs. he ran, but she got caught. the dogs ripped her apart. gregory loved that girl, no wonder he was upset. did you have a good time? [theme music]"
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"you're traveling through another dimension- a dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind, a journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination. your next stop, the twilight zone. she's all set, mr. radin. how about the sound system? you check that out? she's all ready to go. i don't know where you got your sound effects but you'd swear a bomb was exploding. i mean a big bomb. that's precisely the way it's supposed to sound. that about do it, mr. radin? that about does it. you got quite a setup here. this part of the illusion too? no, this room is not an illusion. i venture to guess that it's the best designed bomb shelter on the face of the earth- who knows? the hydrogen bomb is not an illusion. but tonight it's for gags, huh? something of the sort. a practical joke, let's say. you can say that again. when they start those sound effects and that stuff on the screen you'd swear the world was getting blasted. that's the idea. i have three guests coming this evening; rather special guests. you did this to fool three of your friends? must be kind of special friends. they are; they are, indeed- very special friends. what you have just looked at takes place 300 feet underground, beneath the basement of a new york city skyscraper. it's owned and lived in by one paul radin. mr. radin is rich, eccentric and single-minded- how rich, we can already perceive. how eccentric and single-minded, we shall see in a moment, because all of you have just entered the twilight zone. good evening, friends. just step across the hall to the door straight ahead of you. please come in, if you will. sit down, make yourselves comfortable. please sit down. how good of you to come. colonel hawthorne, mr. hughes, mrs. langsford. it's radin, isn't it? aren't you paul radin? you have an excellent memory, reverend. and you, colonel, do you recognize me? i believe i do. served under me once, didn't you, radin? i did indeed, second lieutenant, infantry regiment under your command, africa, 1942. i recall it vaguely. i seem to recall something else too. it's not surprising it doesn't flood back to you. you had a few thousand men under you. i was only one. but then again, you didn't court-martial all of them. that distinction you reserved for me. ah, yes, i do recall. you refused to lead an assault on a hill; refused in the face of a direct order. the delay cost us almost a company of men. that was your contention to the court-martial board, and so i was stripped of rank, dishonorably discharged. you were fortunate, mr. radin. were i to have dictated the sentence i would have had you shot. i'm sure you would have, colonel. i'm sure you would have. but what a wretched host i am to neglect the lady present. mrs. langsford. do you recall who i am? of course, i do, paul. i taught you in high school. i don't forget my students. oh, sometimes the names and the faces get confused but if i prod my memory i usually can connect a name and a face- and, in your case, a character. you flunked me, mrs. langsford; dressed me down before an entire class; called me names, humiliated me. well, let me say again, how good of you to come. i'm delighted you accepted the invitation. invitation? the request that i come here was an ultimatum. your chauffeur said it was a matter of life and death. well, yes, yes, indeed. that's the way it was broached to me. i was having my dinner and my wife mary went to answer the door, and when she came back, she had such a strange expression on her face. ah, mr. hughes, you've never ceased to be a bit on the wordy side, now, have you? it's odd, really, how changeless we remain over the years. but then again, i suppose certain lifetime habits are not easily put aside. paul, perhaps you'd be good enough to tell us why we've been asked to come here. i'd be delighted to. but first, can i get you something? a highball, perhaps... or a cup of coffee? reverend, how do you take your coffee? habits, mrs. langsford- the incredible persistence of habits. you call me paul, as if i were still sitting in the front row in your classroom. but what about you, mrs. langsford? a nice cup of tea? thank you, no. oh? how about you, colonel- a tot of rum, perhaps? i would appreciate if you made your point and let us leave. you've obviously called us here for something and i would welcome hearing whatever it is. how staunchly military, colonel. drive, drive, drive! get up against that objective and wipe it out. red flag in the map and troops out of the sun. the nerves of steel and a concrete head. that will be all, radin! colonel, you are no longer in command. i'm in command here and what i command is your attention. i called you three here for a very specific purpose. i want to settle three old scores but will do it in chronology. my dear old schoolmarm shall begin- that staunch and intrepid educator that looks so out of place without her severe spectacles covering severe eyes looking out of a severe face and possessing that vast prerogative that comes from the school board, and the vast courage that comes with pitting all her wits and instinct and knowledge against captive children. are you finished, paul? my dear schoolmarm, i've hardly begun. well, then, may i make an observation? just a comment on how incredible this whole thing is that a man like you, a millionaire three times over, an important man who walks with kings and heads of state and industrial tycoons- that such a man should have a mind so tiny that it could brood over a high school incident of 20 years ago and let it fester inside you as you seem to have done. i have never liked humiliation, whether it happened 20 years ago or in the past ten minutes. humiliation? all right, paul, let's talk about humiliation. let's talk about your humiliation. mr. radin was caught cheating in an examination. not a crime, of course, but perhaps a bit indicative of the character of the person who does it. and when he was accused of this act, this cocoon- soon to become tycoon- tried to plant his crib sheets on an innocent student. how right you are, mr. radin, that i stood you up on your feet and in front of the entire class i told you exactly what you were. but no room was there then, mrs. langsford, for a moment of compassion, for an iota of sympathy for a poor, frightened, desperate boy. mr. radin, i've dealt with frightened and desperate children all my life. and it may surprise you to know that i've lent them more of sympathy and of compassion than i have lent them of knowledge. but neither sympathy nor compassion can be handed out wholesale, like cheap bubble gum. the recipient must be worthy of them and you never were. you were a devious, dishonest troublemaker. and in spite of all your millions, it's my guess you are still devious, you are still dishonest. and i've no doubt, even now, you're a troublemaker. you haven't changed, mrs. langsford. mr. radin, obviously many years have passed between now and the time you felt you'd suffered indignities at our hands, but what's to be gained by... a great deal can be gained, reverend. a very great deal. you, for example, accused me of a lack of character, put a scandal over my head, destroyed my reputation. yes, i remember. a girl, mr. radin, a girl you drove to suicide. because even at that early stage you were not a man who held honor in very high regard. you can go to the devil, reverend! radin! and you, too, colonel. tonight, my friends, you will all go to the devil, and that is not a figure of speech! do you know why i built this room down here? those walls are 18 inches concrete with and around them, six inches of lead. i have my own generator system, my own air system. yes, and out there, beyond that door, a storeroom the size of a warehouse. you understand logistics, colonel. does it occur toyouwhy i should have gone to all this trouble and expense? to begin a vigil, my friends. the long wait and the countdown. yes. i have walked with kings and tycoons, as you perceive, mrs. langsford. i have walked with them, and i have listened to them. i keep abreast of the times, and usually well ahead of them. i know things that are going to happen. i pay for the service. 48 hours ago i received a most interesting bit of news, something that perhaps only six men in the world know of... the world is coming to an end this evening, ladies and gentlemen. at 11:45, there will be no more city, no more country. at 30 minutes after midnight, there will be no more world. they are going to bomb us, and we are going to bomb them. by dawn, there will be nothing left but rubble and bodies. and in a few moments it will all begin. you'll be hearing sirens very shortly- that's the red alert. that means their missiles are on their way. ours will follow soon after. and you are to survive, mr. radin? is that the idea? i am to survive, mr. hughes. i am 300 feet underground. and what about you, reverend? do you wish to survive? do the rest of you wish to survive? or am i to be the only pallbearer? this is your civil defense announcer. repeating, the air defense command has just declared a take-cover signal. this is not a practice warning, not a drill. an attack by enemy forces is expected at any moment. you must seek the nearest shelter immediately. if you are in your home, go to your prepared shelter or to the basement. if you have no shelter or basement, go toward the center of the house, to the first room or hall that will put as many walls as possible between you and the outside of the house. take your radio with you. if you are in any other type of building, go to the basement or lowest floor and get as close to the center of the building as possible. ...leave your shelter until told it is safe to do so. this is not a test. this is a real take-cover... comments? perhaps a little military sophistry now, colonel. a quote from general grant. or you, reverend, something enriching from the gospel. such silence, mrs. langsford? nothing in that vast repertoire, that pilgrim's progress mind of yours, to handle the situation? a mental eraser to wipe out reality? i've got to get to my wife. by all means, reverend, get to your wife. hold hands and die together. you turn my stomach, mr. hughes. ""get to your wife."" that's not what's on your mind. what's on your mind is what's on the colonel's mind and the schoolmarm's mind. your precious hide, your sanctified flesh. that's what preoccupies you at the moment. if i'm to die tonight i want to be with someone i love. ""somebody i love..."" how theatrical! but more burlesque than legitimate. have the decency, reverend, to depart this earth with just a fragment of the truth in your mouth. tell me to my face that you're so scared, so miserably frightened, that you'd sell your wife by the pound if it meant your own survival. if those were the last words i spoke before i died, they would also be the worst falsehood i ever uttered on earth. now, will you open this door? will you let me leave now? how did you know, radin? how could you possibly have known? what difference does it make? if he'll let us leave now perhaps we can reach our homes my dear friends, shall we drop the pretenses now? shall we, all of us now, tell the truth? i told you how this room steel, concrete and lead. it may be the only place on earth where you can survive. now, what is this nonsense about going back to your homes? do you mean to say that you would walk out of here and die when by simply sitting here you could live? are we to understand, mr. radin, that you will permit us this luxury? you will allow us to stay? of course, colonel. as a matter of fact, it's precisely why i've asked you to come. each of you in his own way has tried to destroy me. but i'll not repay the compliment. that is to say, i will not require an eye for an eye, nothing as primitive or as naked as that. what is your price, mr. radin? i'd be interested. the colonel would be interested. i presume the reverend and the schoolmarm would be interested. i submit, dear friends, you're not just interested. it's probably the only thing in god's earth that has any meaning left at all. but the price, colonel... you will beg my pardon, you will ask my forgiveness, and, if need be, will get down on your hands and knees to perform the function. ""pretty please with sugar on it."" how's that? speak up, teacher. ""pretty please with sugar on it."" it's what children say to exact a favor. i don't want your favor, mr. radin! let me out of here! if i'm to spend my last quarter hour on earth i'd rather spend it with a stray cat or alone in central park or in a city full of strangers whose names i'll never know. the door, radin. will you open the door now? open up, radin. you're too blind or you're too stupid, because none of you seem to understand. all you have to do- literally, all you have to do- is to say a sentence. just a string of silly, stupid words. like a command, colonel, or like a lesson, teacher, or like a prayer, reverend. all you have to say is you're sorry. all right, you want to die, fine. but you'll be back inside five minutes. there's the elevator! take it! take the farce to its conclusion. go up into the street and see the panic and the frenzy and the horror. and then come back down here to your salvation. or you can watch it all down here on that screen. you can see it all happen, the whole thing. watch the world being shoveled into a grave. it's your last chance. it's your last chance, i mean it. tell me, reverend, is life so stinking cheap that you can throw it down a drain? life is very dear, mr. radin, infinitely valuable. but there are other things that come even higher. honor is one of them- perhaps the most expensive of them all. amen. try not to get too lonely, mr. radin. use mirrors. they may help. put them all around the room. then you'll have the company of a world full of radins. it'll be a fantasy, of course, but then your whole life has been a fantasy, a parade of illusions- illusions about what people have done to you, illusions about what justice is, illusions about what is the dignity of even the lowest of us. a fantasy, mr. radin, and now you can have it all to yourself. no, it's not true, it's not a fantasy. no, it's not a fantasy! this is your civil defense announcer. our military authorities have just ordered a take-cover alert. attack by enemy forces is imminent. take cover immediately. if you are in your car driving away from your city, continue. keep on driving. do not stop. when movement is no longer possible, seek the best available refuge. that's enough! if you are outdoors on foot, hurry to the nearest shelter... that's quite enough! anybody? anybody. please... somebody... hey, mac, mac. had a little bit too much? hey, mac. i didn't want it this way. let me take you home, mac. i didn't want it this way. no, somebody, please. mac...? anybody, won't somebody listen to me? go on now, move along. move along, please. there isn't a thing here to worry about. move along, please! please, move along, please, please. it's okay now. you're gonna we're going to help you. isn't there anybody left? nobody? you're gonna be all right. nobody! now, go on, break it up. there isn't a thing here to see. nobody. nobody... oh, god... god... mr. paul radin, a dealer in fantasy who sits in the rubble of his own making and imagines that he's the last man on earth, doomed to a perdition of unutterable loneliness because a practical joke has turned into a nightmare. mr. paul radin, pallbearer at a funeral that he manufactured himself in the twilight zone. rod serling, creator ofthe twilight zone, will tell you about next week's story after this message. and now, mr. serling. next week, through the good offices of mr. charles beaumont, we take a walk in some dead man's shoes. it's the story of a hobo who takes some shoes off a recently-deceased hoodlum, and then discovers that if the shoe fits, you have to wear it. and in this case, you have to do as the shoes do- go where they tell you to and then perform some services above and beyond the norm. i hope we see you next week for ""dead man's shoes."" seat belts can reduce serious injury by one-third. does your family have the security of seat belts?"
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[music playing] the possibility that a large woman might one day swallow a small clergyman is one that has always appealed to me. my mind first started wandering in this direction one day in the zoo, while i stood watching a huge snake swallowing a live rat. the rat didn't wish to be swallowed. he was against it. but the snake hypnotized him so he had no chance, and down he went. the keeper told me it would take the snake five days to digest the rat. and that's when i got to wondering how long a large woman would take to digest a clergyman with all his clothes on, if he were not too big. that, of course, would depend on the woman. but i know one or two who could have him for breakfast and still feel hungry at the end of it. [organ playing] every man that striveth for the monastery is temperate in all things. i keep, under my body, lists that by any means, when i have preached to others, i myself should be a castaway. st. paul's first epistle to the corinthians, chapter 9, versus 25 and 27-- dearly beloved-- [music playing] --dearly beloved, in this age of mischievousness, st. paul is sadly out of fashion. i could eat him. couldn't you? edith.

[music playing] see how she's washing the baby? now just imagine, my pet, that the baby is you, and josephine is me. isn't it funny to think i used to do almost exactly the same thing to you once? oh, look. she's fondling it and kissing it all over. there-- she's really kissing it now, isn't she? exactly like you and me. she's eating it. mommy, she's eating it!

[music playing] well, blow me. for you, vicar. you were right. dare i suggest that you donate it to the fabric fund, mr. pollard. right-- my pleasure. i'll do that right away. well, george, our reward is knowing that the females really are more lascivious than the male. when it was your turn, you went for the nuts and raisins. i know where i stand now. thank you, george. point proved. my advantage, i think. (singing) hmm, if i had meant well. well-- were meant well. if i had meant well, god will reward me. [church bells ringing] [music playing] julia. yes. the vicar's considering if he dare take a sip of our fruit cup. oh-- it's scrumptious. no, i-- i-- lemonade, i think. oh, george, this is so much better for you than fizzy lemonade. a carbon dioxide attacks the lining of the stomach. didn't you know? really? don't be frightened, george. drink it. claire: don't be frightened, georgie. drink it. [music playing] not too sticky for you, vicar? we don't eat the mint. or the cucumber. that's his third. [giggling] is someone amusing?

'cause fast as we move 'em in now, we're gonna herd 'em out. we buy by the herd, and we sells 'em by the herd. oh, for you folks uptown, that's called volume buying. well, now, shucks, about all a country boy can do with a buck or two he makes on a sale is to keep the lights on, pay the ranch hands. now, you know that old country boy shoots straight with you. i mean, he tells you right now if any of his beauties come up late. will you take this little philly right here? hot dog, this one... phyllis. the doctor wants you to go to sleep. that's why he gave you a sedative. i can't sleep. you wouldn't be able to, either, if you'd seen what i did. well, stay awake. only, what you saw- i don't want to hear about it. he told you? yes. he said not to worry. he said... he said for you to just go to sleep and everything would be fine. is there anything i can get you? no, no, that's okay. phyllis... yes? i got to talk to you. sit down. oh, no, you don't. every time you start that, we wind up having a fight, and if you don't mind, tonight i'm passing. i'll make sure there's no fight. don't you worry about that. anyway, i got nothing to fight with you about. if anyone is to blame for us not getting along, it's me. now, come on, sit down. oh, youaresick. you're not well, joe. if you were in your right noodle, you wouldn't talk like that. no, i mean it. come on, i mean it. come on, sit down, honey. look, phyllis... you know, driving a cab is pretty lonely work. you're all by yourself for hours and hours, and in between times, people are yelling at you to slow down, go ahead, to take madison avenue, to not take madison avenue, to turn right, left, stop. and on top of it, everybody says you're crooked. so... when somebody comes along and smiles at you and calls you ""mister,"" well, maybe you go all to pieces and start to think the moon and the stars are your private property and that it's spring. well, you act like a first-class donkey, kicking up your heels like you were 17 or 18. get what i mean? no. well... there ain't no point in drawing you pictures. what i was trying to tell you is that, well, you know- seeing you dead like that, it was an awful shock and it made me realize that... well, you know what i'm trying to say. no. say it. okay, i will. it took a shock like that to make me realize that... that you are not... well... it's you i'm in love with. i'm touched. all right. i'm really touched! all right, don't get nasty. what am i supposed to do, get all dewy and gooey? am i supposed to fall all over myself because my husband of 27 years finally decides he loves me? i didn't mean it that way. after chasing half the bronx and the entire borough of manhattan, you pin the blue ribbon on me, which means i win a used nitwit to feed, to pamper, to keep and obey till death do part! take it easy, phyllis. i'll take it easy. i'd take a butcher knife to you if you weren't in bed and out of your right mind. who's out of his right mind? you are! if you think i'm going to take your dirty doings lying down... so some guy hailed you on the way to the garage and asked you to take him to yonkers. no wonder we've been short of money for the last month! you've been blowing it all on that flea-bitten floozy! get out of here! you bet i will! if you think i'm going to live with a man that's done what you've done... giving you the best years of my life... i trusted you! well, mr. britt, i'm going to take you to court- you and that fancy woman of yours, whoever she is! go ahead, if that's what you want! that's the thanks i get for wanting to be honest. that's the thanks i get for wanting to turn over a new leaf. kill me- i'd like to see him try it. i'll tear him limb from limb, the dirty, rotten cheat. i don't know what i ever saw in her. she ain't got no understanding. she wouldn't know sympathy if it hopped up and bit her on the backside. your honor, the prosecution objects to these interruptions by the defense. they've had their chance to refute the testimony of our expert witness, and all they did was to put dr. saltman on the stand. now, even he testified that in his opinion, the accused was sane when he committed the murder. so in this summation, when i demand the penalty of death... phyllis! i'll ""phyllis"" you! phyllis! what are you trying to do, drive me bugs? how can you stand there listening to this? joseph britt, you have been found guilty by a jury of your peers. it is the judgment of this court that you be taken to the sing sing state prison and there be kept in custody and put to death in a manner provided by the law. how can you just stand there? you must be bugs! what you see is in your mind, joe, and what you hear is your conscience. there, take a good look! turn it off. why? it's just another program like wrestling. let's watch it together. i haven't had a good laugh all day. get out of my way, phyllis! ooh, i'm so frightened. you scare me to death. oh, my, my, how rough you are. tell me what you see, joe. what did you see, joe- lady wrestlers? what do you see, joe- a burlesque show? fan dancers from yonkers? yonkers? fan dancers? did you see them, joe? yonkers, yonkers, yonkers! fan dancers! fan dance! i'll kill you! ha! ha! i'll kill you! ha! ha! now turn on the tv, joe! give me... oh... you... come on, come on, give me that! you... you... you call yourself a wife? oh, you dirty...! get off of me! well, you will, huh? going to kill me, are you? i'll kill you. phyllis... phyllis! what have i done? oh... i didn't really mean it. i killed her. i killed her. oh... fix your set okay, mister? youwillrecommend my service, won't you? the next time your tv set is on the blink, when you're in the need of a first-rate repairman, may we suggest our own specialist? factory-trained, prompt, honest, 24-hour service. you won't find him in the phone book, but his office is conveniently located- in the twilight zone. and now, mr. serling. next ontwilight zone, we move into new orleans for the mardi gras, and we do it with a vengeance. robert keith and milton selzer appear in a bizarre story of men, masquerades and masks. this is a small shocker to wind up your week, and if it doesn't send you to a psychiatrist, it'll send you at least to a mirror. ontwlight zonenext, ""the masks."""

1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"this is not champagne. you can see my tastes are much too simple for that. this is not intended for a christening. it is my ship to shore communication. i realize that my yacht may seem rather old fashioned to luxury minded people, but i find the relationship between a man and a gasoline engine too coldly impersonal. my engine is far more economical and very quiet too, except for an occasional scream and the clanking of chains. it is also quite speedy. this is the accelerator. so much for the simple pleasures. we are presenting a story tonight called day of reckoning. it follows in precisely one minute. sorry partner, i lost this one for us. don't feel bad. my brother and his wife have developed mental telepathy into a high art. harold, she's accusing us of cheating. sibling rivalry. you witnessed the crime, judge. are we guilty or innocent? not enough evidence. wouldn't you like to sit in, paul? i'm sure your sister would be better off without me. no, thanks. felicity, who is the man? what's his name? i have a right to know. please, paul, let's not go over it all again. i told you i can't go on. i simply want a divorce. you've always said before there wasn't anybody. there never was. but this time there is, isn't there? you can't deny it. i'm not denying it. i want his name. you'll know eventually. oh, not to have it now. why? because you know you wouldn't get your divorce if i knew his name, is that it? i didn't say that. you don't have to. paul, when there was nobody you always thought there was. you always behaved as if there was. you made it impossible long ago for me to go on loving you. what difference now does it make if there is someone? i can fight the divorce. that won't get me back. felicity, darling, please. please, give him up. no, i can't. i won't. you're not going to him. you can't stop me, paul. felicity! wouldn't felicity like to sit in? i'm being taken to the cleaners. no, i, uh, have to. doesn't she want one of you men to take over the steering? no, she doesn't. well, i wish she'd come and watch the game. i'm playing brilliantly. felicity never thought i was much of a bridge player. you never were, darling. let that be a lesson to you, trent. don't get married. flattery stops at the alder. oh! she must have run us aground. passengers will quietly move to the lifeboats. women and children last. felicity, what's up? we'd better take a look. felicity! felicity! out here! out here? that's impossible! felicity! felicity! felicity! felicity! she must have fallen overboard. she can't swim. judge, would you take that searchlight and go forward? i'll see if i can back her up. the bank will double back on our course. hold steady, everybody. trent, there's a flashlight there. don't worry, dear. she'll probably manage to reach the bank. anything up there, judge? no, nothing. al has made some coffee. no, thanks. any sign? what are we going to do? i think we should head back to the house. i know you want us to keep searching, paul, but we'll need more help. we'll have to call the police. my men are searching the lake now. we should have some results by morning. that is very encouraging. we're doing our best, mr. sampson. if you folks don't mind, i'd like to ask a few questions. can't they wait, sheriff? this is hardly the time. he's only doing his job, carolyn. this is what happened, sheriff. after dinner this evening, felicity suggested that we take out the cruiser. judge wilcox here happened to stop by, and we invited him to come along. well, anyway, we were playing bridge, and felicity was at the controls. and that's the last we saw of her. she must have fallen overboard. that seems kind of strange, doesn't it? is mrs. sampson just losing her balance like that? was she drinking by any chance? she'd had a few martinis. how many would you say? i don't really know. she wasn't drunk, if that's what you're implying, sheriff. now, i don't believe i know you, sir. this is trent parker. he's been our house guest here for the past few weeks. trent parker? well, i know the name. i'm a golfer. i played here in the tournament last spring. that's where i met the sampson's. yes, of course. pleasure to meet you, mr. parker. sheriff, my brother's very tired. why don't you come back in the morning? well, i was going to ask mr. sampson to go out on a cruiser with me. there are a few things i'd like to clarify for my report. at this hour? not really, sheriff. it's all right, carolyn. may as well get it over with. dave, would you mind coming along with us? no, of course not. carolyn, i will be at home if you need it. thanks, alex. is this where you ran aground? approximately. have you found anything? no luck at all, sir. i'd like to try to reconstruct the accident, if you don't mind. how can you, sheriff? well, i can try. the coroner is bound to ask a lot of questions. i'd like to have some of the answers. now, let me see if i've got it straight. all the people were in the cabin except mrs. sampson. she was at the controls? no, no. we were on autopilot. she was sitting right here on the rail. now, you came out. any particular reason? to see if she might like another drink. did she? no, so i went back inside. and after that, she fell overboard. it's funny nobody heard her cry out. remember, sheriff, the engine was running and the radio was playing. that's true. well, let's try a little experiment. frazier? yes, sir. i want you to sit on the railing. mr. sampson will come out of the cabin, talk to you, go back in. after a while, fall overboard, give a shot and swim to shore. am i close, sir? well, you can get down to your shorts. can you swim? yes, sir. all right. head it out and put it on autopilot. now, mr. sampson, if you'd be good enough to duplicate your actions... look, is this really necessary? i'm afraid so, judge. it's a few hours ago. the others are playing cards. where were you, judge? about here. all right. now, mr. sampson, you think your wife might like a refill, so you go out. pardon me, judge. and the radio is playing. you can come in now, mr. sampson. mr. sampson. i came back in here and watched the bridge game. hey! never mind that. i'll have one of my men  clean it up before we dock. excuse me. fraser, are you okay?  yes, sir. that's strange, isn't it? we heard the cry even though the radio was playing. that's because we were waiting for it. last night, everyone was  concentrating on the game. yeah, even so, you'd think someone would have heard her cry out. unless... unless what? unless mrs. sampson didn't cry out at all. why wouldn't she? there's always the possibility she took her own life. don't be absurd. felicity had everything to live for. besides, if she wanted to commit suicide, why do it this way? i'm sure there are easier methods. yeah, i suppose so. well, we'd better head back. i'm sorry i'd have had to put you through this again, mr. sampson. paul? did they find anything? nothing yet. perhaps we'll hear in the morning. i drove into town to get my things. i didn't want you to be alone. the house seems so empty. i keep expecting to hear a voice. carolyn? yes, dear? carolyn, i've got to tell you something. i must share it with someone. what is it? felicity was leaving me. leaving you? she told me last night. why? did you have a quarrel or something? no, no, no, nothing like that. she was leaving me for another man. i don't believe it. neither did i, at first. who was it? she didn't tell me, but i think i know. paul, today... would you excuse me? i was just going to get a nightcap. can i get you something? no, thanks. trent? he's been staying here for weeks, hasn't he? he's been giving her golf lessons every day, alone. it's incredible. i'm not sure. not yet. but i'm going to find out. paul, what difference can it make now? look, try to get some sleep. we'll talk about it in the morning. all right? good night. paul? maybe there's still a chance felicity isn't dead. i know it seems almost too much to hope for, but after all, they haven't found her body yet. maybe she did manage to reach the shore. maybe she's still alive. i don't know. i don't understand how mrs. sampson fell overboard. how does anyone fall overboard? she slipped. she lost her balance. in that case, she would have fallen into the boat, not out of. maybe she fainted. that's a possibility. i called a doctor to check on her, but he's out of town. was she subject to fainting spells, by the way? not that i know of. now, another thing. when we examined the deceased's body, we noticed a bruise on her forehead. what are you suggesting? that she was struck before she fell? no, not at all. i just wondered where it came from. i can explain that, sheriff. felicity and i took a walk yesterday. there was a low branch in its structure. nothing serious, but enough to raise a bruise. i see. did any of you notice that bruise last night? i don't like the tone of that question. you act as if we might have something to hide. not at all, mrs. sampson. i'm just trying to put the pieces together. you can't play checkers without a board. i wasn't aware we were playing games, sheriff. apparently, you won't accept the fact that this is a simple accident. the only thing left is murder. and since i was with felicity before she died, it seems i'm the obvious candidate. please, mr. sampson, there's no reason to talk like that. i haven't accused anybody. not directly? not even indirectly. well, then i apologize for misunderstanding you, sheriff. my wife had an accident and was drowned, but you won't take that at face value. you keep on asking questions. what sort of accident? how did she fall? why did she fall? i think those are reasonable questions under the circumstances. and as far as accusing you of anything, the thought never entered my head. are you sure? of course i'm sure. well, think about it now, sheriff. i could have killed her. it is possible, isn't it? well, anything's possible. well, this is more than possible. it's probable. i was alone with her. no one else was out there. i could have pushed her over the side. couldn't i? couldn't i, sheriff? this is ridiculous. paul didn't go near her. why do you say that, judge? because i could see them clearly from where i was standing. they were in my line of vision the whole time. and nothing happened? nothing. he didn't touch her. i wish you'd said something about this before. i didn't think it was important. after all, no one had made any accusations until a minute ago. i haven't accused anybody, even though mr. sampson seems to think so. i've got to be going. the inquest will be tomorrow morning, ten o'clock. i'll see you out, sheriff. we should be going too, dad. thanks, dave. for what? for telling that lie. you couldn't see us at all. well, he seemed to be looking for some explanation for the accident. he was being a nuisance, so i thought i'd head him off. i appreciate it, but you weren't taking a chance. not really. i wasn't under oath. besides, what difference does it make? you certainly didn't kill felicity, did you? no. so no harm done. i'll see you at the inquest. she was quite excited the day i bought those for her. she always used to look forward to her lesson with you. so did i. we had some good times together. i'm sure you did. look, am i in the way? i mean, do you want to work? i don't find it exactly easy to work right now. well, they say it's good therapy. keeps the mind occupied. is that what you'd like me to do? design a new office building? just a suggestion. what are you so anxious for me to forget? i beg your pardon? let's stop pretending. i know. what are you talking about? about you and felicity. what about us? you knew she was leaving me, didn't you? now, paul, you've gone through a terrible experience. she was going away with you. now, wait a minute. that's ridiculous. where did you get such an idea? no, it's not ridiculous. she told me herself. i admired your wife. i liked her very much as a friend, but that's as far as it ever went. oh, i'm sure it was easy enough for you. it's always easy for the other man. he can present himself in the best possible light, make promises he never intends to keep. you have no responsibilities, no roots. i suppose she'd like that, too. cheap romanticism. paul, did felicity say she was leaving you for me? no, she never mentioned your name. of course, she wanted to keep you out of this. but who else could it have been? you were in love with her, weren't you? you were waiting for the chance to take her away from me, weren't you? only it didn't work. and now felicity's dead. but she didn't say i was the man, did she? you just guessed i was. i knew you were. the only thing i have to figure out now is the best way to kill you. oh, hey, paul, i'll take your word that she was going to leave you. it seems incredible, but it must be the truth. and i can see why, in a way, you thought i was the one. but you're wrong, paul. you're really wrong. am i? i've never wanted to take her from you. even if i had wanted to, i'd know i never could. besides, i... it happens i'm engaged to be married. you're lying. no, it's the truth. a girl in boston. i met her last year. she's from back bay. her parents don't exactly approve of her marrying a golf pro, as it is. but i wouldn't risk having an affair with your wife. you're crazy. how do i know you're telling the truth? you can call her. i'll give you her number. trent, i'm sorry. that's all right. i should have known it wasn't you. i just couldn't think of anyone else. paul, are you sure it is true? you've had a terrible time. i'm not imagining it, if that's what you mean. i... i don't suppose you'd want to talk about it. i'd like to talk about it to you. as a matter of fact, it'd be a relief, in a way. you know... felicity never really loved me. she as much as admitted it. i think she just wanted to be in love for once in her life. she felt she was missing something. that's the good. i can't explain it. either you understand or you don't. i do. i do. all the same, i think i'd better pack up and leave. it'll be easier all around. trent... you won't mention this to anyone, will you? about felicity leaving, i mean? of course not. it's none of my business. thanks. was it an autopsy performed, sheriff? yes, sir. and the result? mrs. sampson met death by drowning. following a fall from the cabin cruiser? yes, sir. it appears so. appears, sheriff? i just don't understand how she fell, that's all. you've given us the impression that she lost her balance. yes, i think so. i just don't know how. sheriff, i'm not quite sure what you're implying. are you suggesting that there was something irregular in mrs. sampson's death? your honor, i'd like to dismiss sheriff jordan for the moment and call a new witness. very well. you may step down. raise your right hand. dr. feider. what's he doing here? i don't know. would you state your name and occupation, please? felix ryder, m.d. dr. ryder, bailiff tells me that you have some pertinent information concerning this inquest. yes. how did you come by this information? professionally. i was felicity sampson's physician. why didn't you contact us earlier? i couldn't. i was away on a fishing trip. just got back this morning. would you tell us the nature of your information? be glad to. when i came home today, my wife said that felicity, mrs. sampson, had had an accident. said a lot of people all over town were buzzing about it. seems that sheriff jordan couldn't figure out how she fell off the boat. well, i knew i could clear that up, so i came right down here. mrs. sampson came to me about two weeks ago for a check-up. she complained of pains in the chest. so i gave her a complete examination and ran a series of tests. what did you discover? she was suffering from a serious type of progressive mycosis. is that a dangerous kind of disease, doctor? in this case, yes. i didn't have her entire history. but from what i could gather, she'd had a primary infection as a child. this type of disease has a way of recurring. would it be fatal? in time, yes. she had possibly two or three years. in view of the fact that she fell overboard, would you say that dizziness might be one of the symptoms of the disease? yes. arising from the respiratory difficulties, of course. i'll be glad to let the court see my records. thank you, doctor. now, did you tell mrs. sampson about your findings? yes, i did. she asked me not to mention it to her husband or family. i've held that confidence until now. any reason for breaking it? well, just what i said before, to clear up any rumors about her accident. mrs. sampson probably had a dizzy spell, lost her balance, and fell over the side. thank you, doctor. you've been extremely helpful. i have nothing more. well, in that case, i think we can adjourn. that clears the air. no question of the verdict now. accidental death. this concludes the first half of the alfred hitchcock hour. now for our main attraction. the following montage of images and cacophony of sounds is called a station break, and i'm sure you will find it an exciting and colorful experience. observe. welcome back. before we continue with the alfred hitchcock hour, the beloved sponsor's minute. don't forget, paul. if there's anything we can do, just call us. why don't you take a trip somewhere? the change might do you good. yes, sir. well, give it some thought. think, paul? huh? i don't suppose you'll feel much like eating tonight. let me know if you want anything special. all right. i made you a double. it'll be nice having someone to look after for a change. what do you think of harold's suggestion? what suggestion? taking a trip. we could close the house and go to europe. the far east or south america. do you good? i can make all the arrangements. try to remember. didn't felicity say anything at all about what dr. ryder told her? didn't she give you some small hint? you've asked me that three times already, paul. she didn't say anything at all. no hints, nothing. you must believe me. but why? dr. ryder. he could have been the man. do you think he was lying, trying to cover up? paul, please. did she say there was another man? she wanted a divorce, so there must have been another man. why couldn't it have been dr. ryder? paul, he gave the coroner his records. my dear, you can't go on mourning for the rest of your life. try not to think about it so much. believe me, you'll get over it eventually. one day you'll be happy again. carolyn, it's no use. of course it is. i know. don't you understand? i killed her. don't say things like that. it's natural you should feel guilty. you feel you should have stayed with her on the boat. but paul, there's no way you could have known she was ill. didn't you hear what i said? i murdered felicity. i pushed her over the side. that's not true. it can't be. it is true. it wasn't planned. i didn't mean to do it. i'd only gave him one or two, but i did, carolyn. it was sudden. like slashing the head off a flower. the second later, you wonder why on earth he ever did such a thing. this has all been too much for you, paul. i've told you that before. you've been under such a strain. i'm tired of being pitied. everybody's pitying me. the grieving husband. i can't take it anymore. but you are grieving. you don't believe me, do you? you think it's all in my mind. i didn't say that. but you're thinking it. well, what do you expect? you're my brother. i know you better than i know myself. you're not a murderer. you know why you don't believe me, because you don't want to. because it might interfere with your plans. i haven't any plans. oh, yes, you have. the plans you've been making ever since felicity died. coming here to live, taking care of me. you've got a happy picture of us growing old together. i'm sorry, but it's the truth. paul. can't we talk about this tomorrow? tomorrow won't make any difference. this isn't going to go away. it's something i've got to face. promise me you won't mention what you told me to anyone else. i can't make any promises. at least for now. all right. good morning. i understand i'm being put under the microscope. hi, paul. that's dr. pretense carolyn told you, didn't she? well, yes, she did mention something about your problem. problem? is that what she called it? i should think you'd have more imagination, carolyn. or is murder just a household crisis these days, like the maid or the silverware? paul, please, dear. yes, stop it, paul. this is serious. oh, i'm sorry. i didn't realize that. i'm sure you do, alice. what do you think? i think you should have kept this whole thing to yourself. what? why tell anybody? what good does it do? even if you're telling the truth. - alice. well, maybe he is. how do we know? don't be a fool. i just don't know what he expects us to do about it. i don't expect you to do anything about it. you go around talking this way. who are you going to tell next? i'd better tell somebody who'll believe me. oh, yes, by all means. go around telling everyone. the postman, the gardener, the... what should i do? forget about it? yes. for our sake. your sake? whatever you've done, you've no right to drag us into it. don't you realize that we have a reputation in this community? what about my children? and harold's business? alice, i'm sorry. i don't want to involve any of you. but you would. there would be a scandal. what would it accomplish? i murdered felicity. i took her life. and none of you believe me. none of you wants to believe me. of course we believe you. if you say you did it, that's good enough for us. stop trying to humor me. i'm perfectly sane. then think of the consequences. we don't want a scandal. it's funny. if felicity were here, she'd find all of this highly amusing. each of you have your own reason for keeping me quiet, so... i'm afraid i'll have to forget about you and do what i think is best. what does that mean? i don't know yet. where are you going, paul? i'm going to get dressed and go to town. any objections? i'll give you a lift. harold, the watchdog. no, no, no. i'm going that way. all right. i guess i might as well get used to wearing a leash. say, paul, uh, why don't we stop by dr.ryder's? what for? well, with everything that's happened, i imagine you could do with a checkup. physical or mental? physical, of course. i feel fine. say, uh, harold, i need some cigarettes. i wonder if you could stop by that drugstore now, please. oh, hello, mr. sampson. sheriff. excuse my sunday suit. i'm giving my safety lecture to the stool kids. and i'm, uh, i'm supposed to be there in about ten minutes. well, this won't take long. well, have a seat. thank you, sir. now, what's on your mind? well, i, uh, i came by to tell you that you were right. oh, about what? about my wife's death. it wasn't an accident. i killed her. would you repeat that? i murdered my wife. you said something about my being right. well, you were suspicious of me, weren't you? it was fairly obvious. suspicious of you? no. thought never entered my head. there's no reason to be polite. i'm not being polite. i'm just telling you a fact. i didn't at any time connect you with your wife's death. and i don't now. sheriff, will you listen to me? i pushed my wife over the side. i lost my head. she was leaving me for another man. who? well, i, i don't know. i see. no, no, you don't see at all. what's wrong with you? a few days ago you thought there was something suspicious about the accident. yes, i did. frankly, i thought you'd all been drinking and nobody knew what had happened. that or a possible suicide. dr. ryder proved me wrong. i'm sorry your wife's dead. you have my sympathy. but if you think i'm going to make an official report of this conversation, you're mistaken. are you afraid of, sheriff, my family's influence? that's got nothing to do with it. maybe there's another reason. you'd look like a fool if i confessed. people might think you didn't conduct a thorough investigation. mr. sampson, i resent that. i think you'd better go home. your family's probably worried about you. you don't believe a word i've said. no, i don't. and even if i did, it wouldn't make any difference. the law cannot punish a man for a crime unless there is proof that he committed it. and a man cannot convict himself unless there is reasonable proof. but i've admitted it! it doesn't make any difference. you don't have any proof. you said your wife was leaving you for another man, but you can't produce him. you said you pushed her over the side, but judge wilcox says that you didn't go near her. he was lying to protect me. judge wilcox was lying? come on, mr. sampson. you keep talking like that, they're going to lock you up in another kind of place. ask him yourself. look, this is a waste of time and i'm supposed to be giving a lecture. sheriff, would you sooner i went to the district attorney? let's go by the judge's house. hello, paul. sheriff. judge, do you mind if we come in for a minute? not at all. if you promise to overlook the dust, my housekeeper's on vacation. you're wearing your official look, sheriff. force of habit, i'm afraid. judge, do you mind if i ask you a question? - certainly. dave, i want you to tell me... mr. sampson, please, i'll handle this. judge, when i was investigating mrs. sampson's death, you volunteered a statement. you said that all the time mr. sampson was out of the cabin, you could see him. that's right. well, i'd like to know if that statement is true. tell him, dave. of course it was true. no, no, no. tell him the truth. mr. sampson, please, i ask you to stay out of this. if that's anything but the truth, judge, you can do your friend a great deal of harm. dave, don't try to protect me. i'm not trying to protect you. i happened to be watching you in felicity and you didn't go near her. well, that's good enough for me. you mean you're going to forget all about this? yes, sir, and i would suggest that you do the same. thank you for your time, judge. mr. sampson, i have to be going. can i drop you someplace? no. here, you look like you could use this. carolyn called you, didn't she? yes. how much did she tell you? just about everything. paul, did you kill felicity? yes. why? she was leaving me for another man. i know. i was the man. what? that surprises you, doesn't it? i don't believe it. my sister put you up to this. this is some kind of a trick. no, paul. but you hardly knew each other. we met in town by accident a few months ago. i took her to lunch and then to dinner when you were away on a business trip. it got to be a habit. you? i still don't believe it. why? because you think i'd be too old for her? for the city didn't think so. at first she wasn't going to ask you for a divorce. and after she'd been to see dr. ryder, she decided that we were entitled to the time that was left. it was what she wanted. with any consolation to you, i loved her very much. you think i care about that? no, you never care about anything except yourself. how do you think i felt the night that felicity was drowned? i loved her but i couldn't show my feelings. i was supposed to have lost only a friend or the wife of a friend. i wanted to jump in that lake after her. but i didn't. i stayed in the launch and operated that light. but she was down there somewhere under the water. the person i loved most in the world. there's one thing you haven't taken into account. i love felicity too. i loved her for years and i was losing her. so you destroyed what you couldn't have. after the accident i felt sorry for you. i felt sorry for both of us. then caroline told me what you were saying. i knew it was the truth. why didn't you tell the sheriff? that would have been too easy. you want to be caught. it's the only way you can relieve your guilt. but no one believes you except me. you're not on the bench now. you've got no right to pass judgment. you destroyed felicity. i'm going to see to it that you destroy yourself too. you'll do a far better job than anyone else could. you've got the rest of your life to live with the memory of what you did. there's nothing you can do about it. nothing. if you say you killed felicity, people will think you're insane. they'll never believe you. never. somebody will. i'll find somebody. go home, paul. paul? would you come here a minute, dear? we'd like to talk to you. what is it? we've heard from the sheriff and judge wilcox. you've heard from a fool and a liar. paul, dear, we just can't have you walking around spreading these stories. you need rest and help. mr. sampson, this is dr. campbell. he's a psychiatrist at the fairfield institute. get him out of here. paul, dr. campbell would like you to go with him. the institute is only a hundred miles away. you can stay there until you feel better. i'm not going anywhere. i'm perfectly sane. i don't need a psychiatrist. do you want to stay now? get out of here, all of you. mr. sampson, i'm afraid you have no choice. i don't. we'll see about that. your sister and i have signed the committal papers. don't worry, dear. it's just a formality. and if you cooperate with us, mr. sampson, things will be so much easier. it's going to be all right, paul. you'll see. and we'll visit you. we'll all visit you. i have a joyous footnote to the grim scene which you have just observed. eventually our story had a happy ending. judge wilcox later admitted he had been fibbing, and the world knew that paul had been guilty of murder. so he was finally granted his wish. to his great relief, he was taken out of fairfield and suitably disposed of. i have the feeling that i have done quite enough for one day. however, i commend you to the following commercial and the sampling of next week's play."
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[theme music] columbus (voiceover): i got into town on a windy day. [music playing] there was no reception committee, just a few kids. [music playing] they'd never seen anything quite like me before. but i had no wish to be interviewed. it wasn't what you'd call a big place-- no. but big enough-- big enough. [music playing] you'd think they'd never had a stranger in town before. [music playing] [bagpipes playing] [music playing] they thought i was amusing. but that was only the beginning. [music playing] yes, sir? we want a suite. suite, sir? yes-- bedroom bathroom, drawing room and i want a view. i want an uninterrupted view of the entire town. we don't have any suites left, sir. all we have are rooms-- rooms on their own. yes-- oh, good. with no bath, sir? who said anything about a bath? i don't need a bath. all i want is a room, somewhere in the back. the rooms in the back don't have any views, sir. who said anything about a view? my dear young man, is your little town so attractive that i have to look at it? will you sign here please, sir? number 19, sir. thank you. who was that? christopher columbus. on our voyage of discovery. [music playing] columbus (voiceover): the next day was bright and sunny. well, let's take a look. [music playing] construction worker: i think it takes two days to do this job, doesn't it? two days? for a job you could do in a morning? now don't try that on me. greetings, gentlemen. gentlemen would you mind? good trick. now, gentlemen, i want your attention. there, you see? money-- now, watch very closely. money into paper. he's picked the wrong fellow, hasn't he? paper into money. very good. and i'm keeping this. my good man, what day is it? well, it's thursday. thursday-- we're late. [music playing] [laughter] columbus (voiceover): they thought i was crazy, did they? i'd show them if i was crazy or not. i didn't create an earthquake, exactly, but a considerable tremor. well, why not? i was quite a remarkable fellow. [music playing] [umbrella opening] i really became quite popular. [music playing] [motors revving] [music playing] i quickly made one or two influential friends. [music playing] they thought i was funny-- [music playing] --very very funny. good-- good. [music playing] it wasn't long, you see, before everybody knew me. they were always pleased to see me. after a while, do you know what they began to call me? hello, columbus. hello. columbus (voiceover): i became the town character. peculiar looking, you know, but harmless-- quite, quite harmless. [music playing] on the 10th day then, i was ready. [music playing] [music playing] excuse me my good men, would i be correct in assuming that this is the establishment where mr. laythum conducts his business? you're quite correct, columbus. it's the first floor. thank you. but if you've come to see mr. laythum you'd better hurry. mr. laythum leaves at six o'clock. it's five minutes to. time enough-- time enough. [foot steps] [music playing] [gasps] good afternoon. oh, it's you, columbus. what are you doing here? did you want to see mr. laythum? that is the purpose of my visit. i'm sorry, i'm afraid mr. laythum is just going. mr laythum: 9 o'clock sharp, tomorrow morning, ms. parker. all right. well, it looks as if we are just about ready to call it a day. but i'm mr. laythum's secretary. is there anything i can do? no, thank you. mr. laythum was the one i wanted to see. i promise i'll only keep him just one moment. do you mind? of course not. thank you so much. good afternoon. good afternoon. [music playing] columbus, how did you get in here? good afternoon. still want to know what day it is? it's friday. this time i'm late. take a card, any card. oh, columbus-- oh, go on. oh, all right. look at it. i'm looking. the ace of spades. very good-- bravo. now, take another card. no, you take a card. and another card. three of hearts and the 10 of clubs. oh, very good. very good. i like card tricks, columbus. matter of fact, i like to think that i'm pretty good at the old sleight of hand. but there's a time for everything, and this is not it. my dinner will be ready. i don't want to keep my wife waiting. tell what, columbus, you come back tomorrow when i'm not here. you can do all the tricks you like in the morning. now you see it, now you don't. very good. now come on. there's a good fellow. oh, no-- not yet, please. i have something very special to show you. well, what's this? handcuffs-- genuine guaranteed. examine them, please. well, they look all right to me. they are all right-- you take my word for it. now kindly, place them upon my wrists. my wife will kill me. there-- [click] there-- are they shut tightly? they certainly are. i hope you've got the key. oh, i need no key. examine them once more, please. you're quite satisfied? yes, yes. all right. now, watch carefully. the more carefully you watch, the more astonishing the effect. - all right. get on with it. i raise my hands slowly over my head-- very slowly. and i count-- 1, 2, 3-- [click] well, that's very good. examine them again. well they seem genuine. it's very effective. did you invent this? yes. why don't you try? come along. all right. enlarge your repertoire. now, the trick is in slowly raising your hands over your head. no, no, no, no, no-- slowly. 1, 2, 3-- jerk your hands! ah, you see-- not slow enough in the raising, not quick enough in the jerk. so what's the knack? try again. 1, 2, 3-- no, i haven't got the hang of it. you show me again. now you see it-- now you don't. don't mind about that. so much for magic. ok and what about these handcuffs? so much for the escape. now we come to illusion. i take my waistcoat thus-- waistcoat in to bag. isn't that extraordinary? no, i don't think it's so extraordinary. and i don't want to see any more of your tricks. i want to understand this one, then i want to get home dinner. my - tada! will you stop this crazy nonsense? presto-- remember mr. laythum? remember what? me-- remember me? you don't, do you? oh, so sorry. what on earth are you're doing? and i nearly forgot. i'm not really as tall as this. in fact, i'm not tall at all. just medium height. will you stop this nonsense and get these damn handcuffs off me? and i don't wear a top hat-- not as a rule. now, mr. laythum? now do you remember me? not even yet? oh, dear. oh, dear. now? no? well then, how about now? we're getting warmer aren't we, but still not quite. well then, what about now? now do you remember me, mr. laythum? oh, my god-- you. you do remember me, mr. laythum. wonderful-- after 15 years you remember me. how extraordinary. what an extraordinary memory you've got, mr. laythum. most people would have forgotten by now. i mean why should you remember the man you framed for the murder you did? the little man who was so confused he could not answer all your lies in court and got 15 years for the crime you committed. what do you want? money? how extraordinary you should remember me. i'm flattered-- really and truly flattered. but nobody else is going to remember me. do you know who walked through that door a few minutes ago? a crazy old man in a top hat and a big bushy beard. not quite right in the head-- poor old soul. but harmless-- oh, quite harmless. and lots of people saw him come in here-- lots of people-- including your secretary. now when they walk in here tomorrow morning they're going to say, he did it. that old loony did it. you have guests, haven't you? i'm about to show you the best trick of all. best trick you will ever see. i've had 15 years to scheme and dream and work it all out. so now we come to my-- what you might call-- grand finale. ready? now you watch very carefully. umbrella into knife. no. place point of knife just there-- and push. [flesh tearing] [screaming] [coughing] wasn't that a wonderful trick? [music playing] columbus (voiceover): nobody took any notice of the little man who walked out of laythum's office. [music playing] just in time for the 6:20. [music playing] it was over-- the perfect crime. [music playing] never in a million years would they guess that the little man who left town that day was their bearded village half-wit. [music playing] never in a million years-- [music playing] [theme music]"
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"another coco-no-no? no, thanks, i think i've had enough. yeah. me too. i almost forgot. i'm sorry. i think i'd better go back. too chilly? i can turn down the breeze. it's been a lovely program. - yeah. - you're a terrific guy. yeah. i just don't feel that way about you. yeah. knock it off. this was the final battle, wasn't it? neither side expected orelious ix to be the decisive conflict. there's not much left. the destruction is remarkable, considering the primitive period. i beg your pardon? geordi had a big date with christi tonight. he spent days working up the perfect program. looks like it ended early. - cmdr data to the bridge. - acknowledged. we're picking up a signal, coordinates 21 1 mark 61. it would seem to be an ancient interplanetary code. - mr data? - confirmed, sir. survivors on orelious ix, after all this time? not possible. well, hardly possible, number one. lay in a course for the source. - approaching source, captain. - put it on the viewer. a promellian battle cruiser? with its lang-cycle fusion engines intact. sensors indicate no life signs aboard, captain. i should hope not. that ship belongs in a museum. i'm afraid we're a little late. that call for help was probably initiated... ...over a thousand years ago. space, the final frontier. these are the voyages of the starship enterprise. its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. captain's log, stardate 43205.6. we have arrived at orelious ix to chart the battle in which the menthars and promellians fought to extinction. among the ruins, we found a promellian battle cruiser that has withstood the centuries. indulge me. i would prefer it if i could run a security sweep. no. captain's prerogative. this one's mine. we have examined every conceivable risk. the risks on a ship this old and fragile are inconceivable. ghosts, perhaps? number one, have you never dreamed... of climbing inside the bottle? sir? the ship in the bottle. model airships. i used to build them as a child. i bet i had a promellian battle cruiser. - ready to beam down? - locked on, captain. certain about the atmosphere? there is adequate oxygen for life support. it is exactly as they left it. in the bottle. the ship... good lord, didn't anybody build ships in bottles as boys? i did not play with toys. i was never a boy. i did, sir. thank you, mr o'brien. proceed. i did. i really did. ships in bottles. great fun. - what's that? - the power bus may need adjusting. keep me posted. extraordinary! admirable. they died at their posts. you'd expect the bridge layout of this era to be clumsy, awkward. but look at this. it's a model of simplicity. elegant. functional. they built this craft for generations, and it worked. don't you have anything stronger, guinan? - yes. - would it help? no. tell me something. you're a woman, right? yes, i'm a woman. - what do you want in a man? - personally? as a woman, what's the first thing you look at? - his head. - his mind. - of course. - no, his head. i'm attracted to bald men. - seriously? - seriously. why? maybe because a bald man was kind to me once when i was hurting, took care of me. - i'd like to do that. - i take care of myself now. i mean, take care of somebody. i just don't get it. i can fieldstrip a fusion reactor. i can realign power-transfer tunnels. why can't i make anything work with christi? it's like... i don't know what to say. - you're doing fine with me. - you're different. no, you're different. - but i'm not trying now. - that's my point. what is it? the main power returner is acting weird. define weird. i'm getting fluctuating waveguide readings. - run a maintenance sweep. - right. activating power pack, captain. mr worf, get tricorder images of their tactical display. aye, sir. the source of the distress signal is coming from up there. let's end their last cry for help. captain. i believe this is an information storage device. a crude analogue of our isolinear optical chip. crude by our standards today, data. but when this ship was built, humans were perfecting the mechanical clock. still using steel crossbows in battle. - any way to see what's on this? - questionable. i believe i can supply power to its playback unit. its components are quite old. i will amplify the image with my tricorder. i am galek sar, captain of the promellian cruiser, cleponji. i wish anyone who finds this to know... my crew has behaved courageously. i want it recorded for all time that i alone am responsible for the fate that befell us. i have failed as a captain... ...and as the man responsible for all the souls aboard my ship. - picard to enterprise. - go ahead, captain. i think we have seen all there is here. at mr o'brien's leisure, we're ready to return. aye, sir. thrilling. that was... absolutely thrilling. and i was right. there were ghosts on board. one spoke to us. - a friendly one, i hope? - my own counterpart. the captain's final message, praising his crew. i hope you'll be as thoughtful. mr data, revise the annexe. this should be catalogued and then retrieved. i'm sorry, it's just a rare pleasure to see this side of your personality. mr crusher, set course for the original coordinates. captain, we are experiencing a two percent drop in energy reserves. compensating. we were having problems... we are being bombarded with high-intensity radiation. - shields up! - captain, energy loss increasing. - yellow alert. - aye, sir. energy loss increasing. mr crusher. reverse course. full impulse power. no response, sir. - increase speed to warp one. - engines aren't responding. mr la forge, warp power now! matter-antimatter mixture-ratio settings at optimum balance. reaction sequence corresponding to specified norms. magnetic-plasma transfer to warp-field generators as specified. commander, we should be going like a bat out of hell. - power loss now 1 2 percent. - red alert. radiation intensity increasing. we'd better slow these engines down before we burn out. to idle, geordi. is it possible... that we've fallen into the same snare that killed them? a 1,000-year-old booby trap? even with the engines idling, our reserves will be depleted in three hours. we won't hold our shields. mr worf, have you identified the source of the radiation? the radiation field is too strong for our sensors. and no explanation for the energy loss? no, sir. is there anything in the history books, data? fascinating records of menthar battle strategy. they were exceptionally innovative. they were first to use the kavis teke elusive maneuver, as well as strategy comparable to napoleon's... - any situation like this? - no, sir. i recommend i return with a team. - they didn't have much success. - but they knew their enemy. they may have known what caused this. agreed. the impact of lowering shields to get the away team out? - negligible. - and our energy conservation? cmdr la forge, keep the enterprise up and running. data, join the away team. find out what happened on that ship. so why can't we move? computer. as we increased power, was there any counter-reaction? affirmative. the opposing force grew in direct proportion to the power output of the enterprise. so, it kept us from forming a subspace field? that is correct. computer... who is this... l brahms? dr leah brahms, engineer. daystrom institute theoretical propulsion group. galaxy-class starships. team seven, junior member. junior member? looks like she wrote the book on propulsion. call up subspace design logs. select menu. visual records or l brahms' voice entries. voice entries. theoretical propulsion logs, federation starship enterprise. galaxy-class. heading, subspace. author, leah brahms. geordi la forge. how are you doing? - specify program. - yeah. down to work. you're absolutely right. i recommend we evacuate all non-operational areas and group crew on the odd-numbered decks. proceed. i'd like to set up an area for treating radiation symptoms. after the shields fall, how long before fatal exposure? 30 minutes. after that, there is nothing that can be done. away team to enterprise. captain, we may have found something. there's a file of memory coils here. they are identical to the coil we found earlier. - captain's log? - that's what we were thinking. - mr data, are they working? - i believe so. we can enhance them through the image processor. - good. return at once. - aye, sir. computer. generate a cross-section of the dilithium-crystal chamber. what about re-orienting the crystal? it is possible to re-orient the crystal. the key lies in adjusting the lattice-structure direction. this modification will be integrated in the next-class starship. sorry, can't wait. you and me, leah, we've got two hours to figure this out. you know what i need to do? i need to get inside there. i need to be able to turn it inside out. computer, is there a cross-section we can replicate on the holodeck? select menu. design specifications or prototype schematic. prototype? elaborate. a development-stage prototype schematic at utopia planitia. drafting room five of the mars station, stardate 40174. perfect. recreate it in holodeck three. stay with me, doc. ready, computer? holodeck three program is ready. damn! right back where it all started. this is incredible! leah, did you design this? the dilithium-crystal chamber was designed at outpost seran t-one... ...stardate 40052. some of the federation's best minds participated in its development. that's the visiting-dignitary talk. what's the inside story? off the record. access denied. personal logs are restricted. great! another woman who won't get personal with me on the holodeck. leah. i want to supplement the energy supply to the ship and the engines. could we alter the matter-antimatter paths? theoretically, yes. the system should accept reactants at a faster rate of injection. well, this is your baby. show me which ones. computer, did i ask for a simulation? affirmative. you asked dr brahms to show you which system could accept reactants at a faster rate. by accessing available imagery, an adequate facsimile was possible. i did do that, didn't i? ok, well... it's good to see you, leah. continue with your analysis. systems l-452 through l-575 will accept reactants, providing all other systems are calibrated to an equal factor. then, if we use multiple streams hitting more than one facet... ...we could do it, hold our own. leah, you're beautiful. la forge to picard. go ahead. we found a way to extend the energy supplies. - well done. - can you get us out of here? sorry, commander, the first priority was to maintain the shields. - acknowledged. - we'll get to work on it. pass my congratulations to your team. thanks, captain. we're all smiles down here. captain, we've been able to verify that these coils are the logs of the promellian captain. but most of them have decayed and cannot be repaired. any playback? on most, there are brief sections which may yield information. do your best. let's hope we can get the section we need. the promellian must have logged the cause of the death. all in an open locker? he wasn't too concerned with security. 452 through system l-575. adjustments to dilithium-crystal chamber complete. impact analysis, computer. warp energy has increased 1 4 percent. reactants per unit time remaining steady. yes! alright! computer... do you have any... you know, personality on file for dr brahms? starfleet personality profile analysis, stardate 40056. did she ever debate at the intergalactic caucuses on chaya vii? dr brahms attended the caucuses on the following stardates... never mind the dates. computer... if you add data from all these sources, could you synthesise a true representation of dr brahms? there would be a 9.37 percent margin of error in the interactive responses from the facsimile. i can live with that. do it. - dr brahms? - geordi, it's me, leah. don't call me dr brahms, or i'll call you commander. - right. - now... we've maintained energy but we can't leave it without burning out components. so we need to move. - are you with me? - yeah. yeah! we have been stripped of all propulsion and our weapons are useless. we cannot move and we cannot fight. the ship is being lashed with lethal radiation from the aceton assimilators concealed in the wreckage around... - aceton assimilators? - primitive generators which drain power from distant sources. generators? it would not be difficult to modify them to convert energy into radiation. the menthars hide them in debris. an unsuspecting ship flies in. instant booby trap. now we're supplying the devices with the energy to kill us. - no. - listen to me! you can't boost power that way. you increase the speed of the subspace field processor... i want enough power to barrel out of here, not blow us up. this is my design we're talking about. i don't care if you built it with your bare hands. it's gonna go... and we'll go with it. i am not used to being questioned. and i'm not used to dying. ok, look. you worked in a lab on a static model. this is a working machine. it's got tens of thousands of light years on it. - true. - damn right. listen. we'd never be certain that the circuit paths are sealed. you're good. - very good. - i know my ship. inside and out. then you know me inside and out. cos a lot of me is in here. i always wish a chief engineer was present when a ship is built. yeah. designers never get out in space. well... you're there now. - cmdr la forge to the bridge. - on my way, commander. don't go away. i mean... computer, save program. how many devices are we dealing with, data? to create this radiation field would take several hundred thousand. they've been out there a long time. deterioration? there is no way to calculate that. it is likely. is there any indication of weakness in the field? - nothing substantial. - of any kind. well, there is a 0.1 percent dip in the radiation field at... 21 mark eight by 42 mark zero. - i want that 0.1 percent. - fire at those coordinates. we won't maintain energy reserves. we might even lose a few circuits. critical losses? not enough to shut down but i don't know about the shields. there is also the possibility that the phasers will supply what they need most. energy. i imagine a similar discussion taking place on our neighbor ship. over 1,000 years ago. let's hope our decisions are more successful. mr la forge, return to engineering and continue without delay. mr worf. prepare the phasers. phasers locked on coordinates. fire. nothing. radiation levels increasing. eight percent. ten percent. energy reserves are dropping rapidly, sir. damn you. wouldn't that increase the output to gain a quicker response time? the processors can handle the extra input. but how do we reconfigure? energy reserves reaching critical. standard procedure requires termination of all simulations. override standard procedure. - override authority restricted. - what? computer! the crystal lattice is breaking down. we'll repair it at a starbase. the optimist of the group. how long do we have shields based on current calculations? under two hours. the radiation field has increased by 1 7 percent. what impact on fatal exposure? down to 26 minutes. if we resist, we die. if we don't resist, we die. mr la forge, have we shut down non-essential energy? yes, sir. i need some back for a program on holodeck three. - for what purpose? - well... i've gone back to the beginning, to the earliest entries. i've created a propulsion design model to assist me. i believe we're making progress. computer, reinstate holodeck three program. holodeck three program is reinstated. mr la forge, your best suggestion in one hour. picard out. computer, holodeck three program. enter when ready. there isn't much time left. we have to get out of here. the booby trap eats energy. how do we fool it, block it, shut it down? ok, we know that for every move the enterprise makes, there's a countermovement by the energy field. can we use that to our advantage? maybe. there must be a time differential between force and counterforce. if we can adjust the link-ups before the counterforce reacts, we might just move this bucket. yeah. yes! leah, do you like italian food? like it? wait till i make you my fungilli. ok. fusion reactor uplink to navigation processor. then we have to adjust the vector processor and the drive coils. this is impossible. - don't do that. - i thought it would feel good. i don't want to feel that good right now. what time is it? coming up on 1600 hours. god, what am i supposed to tell the captain? it's possible and yet it's not possible. everything says we can't adjust it but if we could, it might work. i could do it. data couldn't even do it. it'll take a thousand adjustments a second. how will you do it? it's humanly impossible. i'm not human. you... you mean the computer could do it? captain. captain, this is... this is a simulation of the expert who designed the engines, leah brahms. we... i've been examining the force- counterforce response times, trying to create linkage at maximum power. and? there's a... there's a chance we could if we turn the ship over to the computer. - what chance? - i don't know. we could program it and try it out. - and this is the only way? - i think so, sir. come. any word from la forge? he has something that may give us a chance, if we stay out of it. he proposes to turn the ship over to the computer because it is capable of quicker adjustments than a human being. computers always impress me with their ability to take orders. i'm not as convinced of their ability to give them. you know, number one, you missed something not playing with models. they were the source of imaginary voyages, each holding a treasure of adventures. manning the earliest spacecraft, flying an aeroplane with only one propeller to keep you in the sky. can you imagine that? now the machines are flying us. end simulation. fatal exposure. computer, reduce thrust levels another four percent. adjust trajectory angle to compensate. begin simulation again. - there you go, we got out. - repeat simulation, same levels. end simulation. fatal exposure. same variables, only the computer didn't quite make it. deflector shield failure. lethal radiation levels. fatal exposure in 26 minutes. - it might work. - it might not. i can't turn the ship over to a computer. it's all we've got. - picard to la forge. - captain. two minutes. give me just two minutes. there is another way, captain. two minutes, please! two minutes, mr la forge. picard out. - geordi, there's no other way. - listen. turn it around. come at it from the opposite direction. god, it's so simple it might work. ok. computer, new simulation. we've only tried overpowering the trap. more energy, faster adjustments. that's what we can't do because we're supposed to do that. that's the booby trap. the answer lies in our own computer. the mind. the best piece of engineering ever. didn't your research indicate we need a thousand adjustments per second? not if we shut everything off. one blast of everything for a microsecond to beat the inertia and then we shut down, except for life-support and two thrusters. no impulse engines. no computer. one propeller? deflector shield failure. lethal radiation levels. fatal exposure in 12 minutes. have you analyzed the risk? the numbers say even. it's no better than the computer, but no worse. forget the numbers. the computer can't compensate for human intuition. - experience. - and the wish to stay alive. make it so. i've run the simulations. i'll take the con. thank you, mr la forge. you've done your job. i relieve you, mr crusher. yes, sir. all hands, we are about to engage engines for a short burst. inertia dampeners are on manual. they may not compensate for the acceleration. brace yourselves. deflector shield failure. lethal radiation levels. computer. discontinue radiation warning until further notice. - it's all yours, sir. - thank you. firing impulse engines. impulse engines down. shutting down all systems. velocity is 135 meters per second. we enter the debris field in eight seconds. starboard thruster. coming to. heading three-four-zero. mark one-zero. thruster is off. captain, that large mass may contain an assimilator. port thrusters firing. no reaction from the assimilator. over the first hurdle. sir, object to port! port thruster is firing. sir, the gravity of the various masses has reduced our velocity by eight percent. by my calculations, we can no longer clear the debris field. thank you, mr data. the asteroid's gravitation is drawing us closer. velocity is increasing. velocity is still increasing. now at 219 meters per second. starboard aft thruster. you used the asteroid's gravitation as a slingshot. excellent! we're out. we got through. you have the con, mr crusher. yes, sir. full restart. all systems back on line. - with pleasure, sir. - number one. make sure that booby trap doesn't bother anyone again. mr worf, ready photon torpedoes. set to detonate on impact with the promellian vessel. aye, sir. i've always thought technology could solve almost any problem. it enhances the quality of our lives. lets us travel across the galaxy. even gave me my vision. but sometimes you just have to turn it all off. even the gypsy violins. violins? different program. we made a good team. maybe we can again. i'm with you every day, geordi. every time you look at this engine. every time you touch it, it's me. computer, exit holodeck. end program."
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"down to my ship. i have a meeting with my engineer. - go back to sleep. - you're the captain. he'll wait. is that how you treat your staff? - let them wait while you sleep? - yes. in fact, some days i never get out of bed. - you're not making this easy. - that's the general idea. you are evil. i am a starfleet officer, the paragon of virtue. more like a parody of virtue. but let's continue this debate another time. - i can't wait. - see you later. this briefing is considered extremely sensitive by starfleet command. please do not share it with anyone without a level 7 security rating. it seems that in invading cardassia, the klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. two weeks ago, the civilian government on cardassia prime contacted the federation council with a request for industrial replicators. that request has been granted. - how many replicators? - 12, all class iv. the federation only gave bajor two cfi replicators. bajor is just one planet. the klingons have destroyed the industrial base of dozens of cardassian worlds. with 12 cfi replicators, they can build new power plants and factories. why the secrecy? starfleet believes the maquis may try to stop or seize the shipment. it makes sense. the cardassians have been so busy with the klingons they've left the demilitarised zone to the maquis. the last thing the maquis want is replicators heading for cardassia. intelligence also reports that the demilitarised zone between cardassia and the federation has seen increasing terrorist activity in the past month. the maquis have built new bases in the badlands. - the cardassians there are worried. - they should be. with no cardassian military presence, the maquis have an opportunity to drive the cardassians out of the dmz permanently. this shipment will pass through deep space 9? yes, sir. in three days. let's tighten security on the station. step up random checks of cargo for weapons or explosives. - more deputies on the promenade. - understood. mr worf, tomorrow, take the defiant and patrol the badlands. show the flag. let the maquis know we're ready for any trouble. mr eddington, i want daily briefings until the replicators are in cardassian hands. - aye, sir. - dismissed. - we would like a word with you. - something wrong? captain... there may be a maquis smuggler here on the station. it's just a theory. our suspicions are based on purely circumstantial evidence. - who is it? - again, we're not certain. i understand that. who? gentlemen? kasidy yates. kasidy? working for the maquis? that's impossible! i hope so. smuggling for a terrorist organisation is a serious offence. where is your evidence? five months ago, the bajorans hired her to carry cargo to their outlying colonies. one of her regular runs is from bajor to a colony on dreon vii. it's a 12-hour run for most ships but she always takes 18. the six-hour difference is just enough for a side trip into the badlands to meet a maquis ship, then on to the dreon system. that's your evidence? she was slow in one of her deliveries? also, starfleet intelligence has infiltrated a maquis cell and obtained a list of their contacts in the bajoran sector. they had cover names, but one moved to deep space 9 in the last six months. captain yates has been living here just under six months. that's damned slim evidence to base an accusation. we haven't made any accusations. i said we have suspicions. that's right, you did. captain, i know this is awkward for you, but may i step up surveillance on her? odo, she's a federation citizen. you can't just invade her privacy based on suspicions. i want to see real evidence before i authorise this. if she's a maquis, she's no longer a federation citizen. the answer is no. understood, sir. gentlemen... there are times we have to search vessels docked at the station. if you can find a reason... we'll let you know. yeah, nerys! there you go. did you see her feint, then, boom, into the wall? yes, it was quite effective. - stop watching her. - i thought the point was to watch. you watch the game, not the spectators. especially not that one. what does she expect? the only cardassian woman on the station, she's bound to attract attention. some, yes. yours, no. oh, come on! that was a foul. maybe i'll say hello after the game. that's gul dukat's daughter. does anyone hate you more than him? besides, she's a friend of kira's. i wouldn't mess with her. i just thought it would be polite. but clearly, you don't think i'm capable of any pleasant discourse without some kind of nefarious ulterior motive. i just think you should leave well alone. - why stir up...? - yes! well played! brava, major! - what happened? - a brilliant move by the major. you should pay attention. come in. i could smell that right down the corridor. it's an experiment. bajoran ratamba stew over spinach linguine. - don't your neighbours complain? - that's only an excuse to get a taste. - how sneaky of them. - yes, they are a duplicitous bunch. all right, break it up. i've got a problem. do either of you know what a kavarian tiger-bat smells like? it's for a story. the computer has pictures, but no olfactory information. you're a writer. make something up. the details have to be right. kas, haven't you been to kavaria? not me. sorry. don't you do a regular run to the next system? no. kavaria's out towards the badlands. i try to avoid it. ask quark. i bet he knows someone who's been there. i thought you made deliveries to dreon vii. that's near the badlands. depends how you define ""near”. on my ship, it's a long way from the badlands. what route do you take? i imagine you go around the rolor nebula. if you're interested in my flight plans, look them up. you are the commander of the station. forget i brought it up. ok, grab a plate and prepare to be dazzled. you first. you're not going to hurt me, are you? normally, i'd make a strategic withdrawal at the first sign of trouble but there doesn't seem to be a way out of here. you could always call security. it'd take them a few minutes to arrive, and by then, it might be too late. i don't think i'll hurt you. i'm gratified to hear that. in fact, you have nothing to fear from me. and you, my dear, have nothing to fear from me. - absurd! we have perishable goods... - what is going on? we must make a class-2 inspection of your cargo before you leave the station. - inspection? for what? - temecklian virus. there's been an outbreak on bajor. we're scanning all cargo before it leaves the system. - my cargo is not from bajor. - no exceptions, i'm afraid. - how long? - six hours. - we'll miss the rendezvous. - we'll see about that. - kasidy? - sorry to bother you. i wouldn't, but... - what is it? - this health inspection. they say it will take six hours, but i rendezvous with a tholian freighter in nine. you know they expect punctuality. - if it weren't for the health concern... - please. i promise to flood the cargo hold with baryon radiation as a precaution but i need to go now, or i'll lose the entire consignment. stand by. can we make the inspection shorter? not if they're to search for contraband during a health inspection. they need to look for camouflage fields, false manifests, computer records. we probably shouldn't bother at this point. kasidy's in a hurry, she'll be standing over their shoulders. it won't be much of a search. i strongly recommend we at least try. you are clear to leave. - just remember to irradiate the cargo. - i owe you one. see you tomorrow. - do you have something to say? - no, sir. now go to the defiant and tell worf he has a change of orders. - you're to follow the xhosa. - aye, sir. what if captain yates meets a maquis ship? your orders are to observe, then report directly to me. - is that clear? - perfectly. the xhosa's altering course, commander. - now on heading 158, mark 325. - the badlands. - stay with her, chief. - aye, sir. say what you will about the maquis, they're not stupid. using the badlands as their base was a smart move, and a gutsy one. they are terrorists. little more than criminals. - criminals always make mistakes. - they're just fighting for their cause. - they should be hunted down. - what for? defending their homes? look at what happened to them. one day they're eking out a living in the colonies on the cardassian border, the next day, the federation hands those colonies over to the cardassians. - what would you do? - i would not become a terrorist. it would be dishonourable. i wouldn't say that around major kira if i were you. how about you, commander? how do you feel about the maquis? - i have no feelings about them. - you must have an opinion. if starfleet says find the maquis, i do it. if they say help them, i'll help them. what matters is doing my job like a starfleet officer. anything else... is an indulgence. i think i've got something. an impulse signature off the starboard bow. - bring us within visual range. - aye, sir. that's a maquis raider. the xhosa's beaming over her cargo. - hello. - hello. - this is your shop. - yes. - it's very nice. - thank you. - you do good work. - how kind. is there something i can do for you? i got this holosuite programme from quark. it's a reproduction of a cardassian sauna. - like the ones back home. - yes... i was wondering if you... might like to try it out with me. we're the only cardassians on this station and the temperature's too hot for almost anyone else. i see. when were you thinking of? maybe the day after tomorrow. say, 2100? i'd be delighted. - great. i'll see you there. - i look forward to it. - morning. - morning. raktajino, extra sweet. makapa bread, no crust. what happened to juice and oatmeal? kasidy introduced me to this. it's great. - when's she due back? - tonight. don't worry, it's meant to do that. the foam tastes like a... a weird peppermint and the bread... i don't know what it tastes like. - you want some? - i think i'll pass. dad, is something wrong? i'm a little tired. didn't get much sleep last night. guess you're not used to sleeping alone any more. what i mean is, you miss her companionship. you miss talking and sharing insights about command and duty... - that's enough. - i was just kidding. i know. i've just got a lot on my mind. - did something happen between you? - not exactly. if you want to talk... what? this is important. you and 1. things change... but not this. forget it. i'm just having a bad day. after the cargo was beamed across, the xhosa left the badlands and resumed its course to dreon vii. do you know what the cargo was? from the residual transporter signature, it was roughly 80% organic. i'd say food, perhaps medical supplies. at least it wasn't weapons. sounds like she's only... - where is the xhosa now? - on her way back to the station. - she should arrive at 1900 hours. - thank you. dismissed. dismissed, old man. come in. - miss me? - were you gone? admit it. without me, you cried yourself to sleep. so, did you make your rendezvous with the tholian freighter? yes. thanks for bending the inspection rules for me. - we'd never have made it. - don't make a habit of it. i promise. where did you meet them? the dreon system? yeah. why? seems odd that they would travel so far just for medical supplies. they really needed them. they have a virus on one of their colonies. in fact, i can't stay. i'm making a run tonight. - but you can inspect the cargo first. - that will make odo very happy. - hey! you're back! - looks like it to me. are you guys busy? i have a new holosuite programme from nog. it's a baseball game between the 1961 yankees and the 1978 red sox. - i'll buy the hot dogs. - i'll pass. have to get back to ops. anyway, the yankees will bury them. have fun. - but i'm only here a few hours. - duty calls. see you when you're back. ok. she's going on another run tonight. she seemed prepared for an inspection so i doubt you'll find anything. captain... we've discussed this at length. we feel that if the xhosa makes another rendezvous with the maquis, we should seize both vessels and arrest the crews. they may not make another run for months. we shouldn't let this opportunity pass. - agreed. - yes, sir. that brings up another point i'd like to discuss, in private, if i may. the cfi replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. i'd feel better if i was supervising security. - lieutenant reese can handle it. - yes he can, but... just say it, commander. the xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. i can't guarantee the safety of kasidy yates. frankly, i don't want the responsibility. i can't say i blame you. the security of the cfi replicators is your priority. - i'll take command of the defiant. - thank you, captain. the inspectors just left. - any problems? - no. kasidy. i'll be right there. how was the game? good. seven-three, yankees. - did you come here just for the score? - no. i was just thinking, why not drop everything and go to risa? just us two. we won't pack a bag. we'll just get in a runabout and go. - what about your station? - i have a great crew. they can handle things around here for a few days. neither of us is doing anything that can't wait for a few days. i'm not sure the tholians would agree. let your first officer handle it. better yet, tell the tholians they won't be getting this shipment at all. i don't think i can do that, ben. i have a commitment to fulfil. but if you want to wait for me on risa, i'll meet you there. forget about it. it was just a crazy idea. - have a good trip. - thanks. it was a tempting idea, ben. - i wish i could take you up on it. - so do i. - they're reducing speed. - match their velocity. these are the same coordinates they used before. - any sign of another ship? - no. but our sensors are limited in the plasma fields. they're turning again. looks like a holding pattern to me, sir. either the maquis are late or the xhosa's early. either way, we wait with them. - can't you fix the lapels? - such as... you're the tailor. just... make them look good. i thought you wanted them to look bad! i wish you'd said. it's so much simpler that way. rudeness will get you nowhere. now, i want more room in the shoulders and these cuffs are completely unacceptable. - garak, can i have a minute? - of course. - excuse me. - sure. - what can i do for you? - listen closely. whatever sick game you're playing with ziyal, it better stop right now. - i can assure you... - spare me your lies. she is here under my protection. i swear, if you do anything to hurt her, i'll make you regret it. is that clear? - as tabalian glass. - good. you told her. the pants are about a metre too long. so, are you cancelling your date with ziyal? it's not a date. and how do you know? you're a man, she's a woman, it's a date. and they are my holosuites. i was going to cancel. i had visions of ziyal presenting my head to her father. isn't that a little paranoid? people who imagine threats against their life are paranoid. i have threats against my life. but after my little chat with major kira, i feel much better. - you do? - isn't it obvious? if ziyal planned to kill me, kira wouldn't warn me away. on the contrary, she would welcome my demise and do nothing to interfere. - unless that's part of the plan. - what do you mean? kira acts like she doesn't want you to go, so you'll feel everything's ok. and then you go anyway. no, it's too complicated. of course. now they're too short. - what? - the pants. this is wrong. terrorists don't work this way. if your contact doesn't show up, you leave. you don't stay and go in circles for five hours. it's possible that her cargo is so valuable to the maquis that she'll wait as long as it takes to make her delivery. i think she's already made it, and you were the cargo. if anyone but kasidy yates was on the xhosa, would you be here? so someone wanted me here? why? i'm not sure. but we won't find the answers by sitting here. you're right. the answers are over there. let's go. mr worf, you have the bridge. - still nothing. - this is getting ridiculous. all right, let's send a coded message... tachyon surge. a ship's decloaking. oh, my god. what are you doing here? we've... don't say it! i know you're a smuggler. you've been working with the maquis. right now, i don't care. but tell me, were you told to draw me here so the maquis could attack the station? jake's back there. whatever your feelings are for me, i can't believe you'd endanger him. i was to meet a maquis ship at these coordinates. i know nothing about an attack, and i doubt the maquis would try. i didn't know you were following me but, after our last talk, i thought you might be out there. then why didn't you abort the mission? i was told these medical supplies were urgently needed and i had to be here. i told them i'd made too many runs lately, that i was asking to get caught, but they wouldn't listen. they knew you would be caught. that's why they didn't send a maquis ship to meet you. everything's been building to this. why draw me away from the station? if not an attack, what reason could there be? what could be happening... happening on the station? i have new orders from starfleet. the cfi replicators will be transferred to a vulcan freighter which should arrive any moment. this operation is top secret. no one aboard the station is to know. does that include bajoran security? absolutely. also, we're observing communications silence. no com traffic in or out for the next nine hours. clear? - aye, sir. - dismissed. - you wanted to see me? - yes. i need to take command for a few hours. we've cleared the plasma field. get us back to the station, maximum warp. any response from our hails? no. deep space 9 seems to be under communications blackout. keep trying. we'll probably never see the xhosa or captain yates again. it's possible. more than possible. if we'd left a security detail... our priority is to reach the station. captain yates is my responsibility. i'll thank you to leave it at that. as you wish. - the replicators are in the ship's hold. - good. we depart in five minutes. i'm leaving you in command until captain sisko returns. - me? - is that a problem? no, sir. it's just unusual for a junior officer to be left... if you're not up to it, i'll find someone else. the safety of this station may depend on you. - you can count on me. - good. - now go to ops and take command. - yes, sir. captain's log, supplemental. the defiant has returned but it seems eddington is still a step ahead of us. all starships in the area are looking for the vulcan freighter. i doubt they'll find it. eddington anticipated every contingency. - bet he had his escape well planned. - what do we tell the cardassians? - the truth. he fooled me. - he fooled all of us. everything that happens on this station is my responsibility. incoming message for you, captain. it's from commander eddington. put it through. in my office. - captain. - i have just one question. why? will knowing my personal motivation change anything? - i don't suppose it will. - then let's table that for now. the reason i've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. our quarrel is with the cardassians, not you. leave us alone, and you won't hear from the maquis again. unless there's another shipment to hijack. if you keep sending replicators to cardassia, you'll have more to worry about than hijackings. i don't respond well to threats. you should know that. but it seems you don't know me at all. i know you. i was like you once. but then i opened my eyes. open your eyes. why is the federation so obsessed with the maquis? we've never harmed you, yet we're constantly arrested as terrorists. you chase us through the badlands and harass our supporters. why? because we've left the federation, and you can't accept that. nobody leaves paradise. everyone should want to be in the federation. you even want the cardassians! you send them replicators so one day they can sit on the federation council. you know, in some ways, you're even worse than the borg. at least they tell you their plans for assimilation. you're more insidious. you assimilate people, and they don't even know it. you know what, mr eddington? i don't give a damn what you think of the federation or anything else. all i know is you betrayed your oath, your duty and me. and if it takes me the rest of my life, i'll see you stand before a court-martial. you'll spend the rest of your days in a penal colony, wondering whether a ship full of replicators was really worth it. - garak? - hello. doesn't it feel good? the station can be so chilly. yes. it's quite pleasant. - aren't you going to lie down? - not yet. i have a question i'd like answered first. - why am i here? - pardon? why am i here? did you really invite the sworn enemy of your father simply to enjoy the heat? you really think i asked you here to kill you? well, it did occur to me. kira and my father told me you used to be an agent of the obsidian order. that you had my grandfather tortured and killed, and could easily kill me without a second thought. although i seldom credit the major or your father with being entirely trustworthy, in this case, they're both telling the truth. you know what else is true? i don't care. i'm half bajoran, that means i'm an outcast back home. i can't go back and neither can you. we can either share some time together or ignore each other. i spent five years in a pow camp by myself. i don't need your company. but if you'd like to stay and share the heat with me, maybe tell me something about home that i don't know, then i would welcome your company. and i get the feeling you'd welcome mine. either way, it's up to you. well... it seems i won't be needing this anymore. so... what shall we talk about first? - just you? - i left my crew at a maquis base. i had to come back, but i wouldn't drag them here to face a prison term. you didn't have to come back either. yes, i did. i think we both know that's why you left us alone out there, to see if i would. i'm not going to stand here and apologise for what i did. you had your duty. i had mine. - i still have my duty. - i know. and i know i'll probably go to prison. but i came back because of us. because despite all that's happened, i still love you, ben. i don't want to throw that away. do you? no. lieutenant reese. i'll be back. i'll be here."
0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"lot of weather we're having. allow me, my lady. shall we go a-trousering? fry, i appreciate the gallantry, but isn't this a bit much? you're right. i'm sorry for showing my love. okay. fine. here, take my hand. news and weather, everyone. i'm sure you've all noticed the bizarre atmospheric conditions of late. come to mention it, yes. it seems something ain't right in the magnetosphere, so i'm launching this high-altitude weather balloon to gather more data. my pants! my lucky pants! they don't look so lucky to me. they are, too! i was wearing them that time i found a dime in my ear. i was wearing them when i won a subscription to redbook. and i was wearing them when i first met leela, so yeah, they're lucky. aw! also... oh, lord. plus, they're my only pants. you've worn the same pants for 1,000 years? no wonder they made a run for it. whoo! soon your trousers will slip the surly bonds of earth and ascend to the heavens. i'm gonna blast that balloon! no way will i let god get my pants! nobody messes with my pants! not even the holy one, blessed be he. look out! a central park badger! i'll save you, pants! scruffy, do you have any varmint grease? what viscosity you need? whoa, there's writing in here! also, this grease is flammable. incredible! who could have done this, the sewer mutants? no, this isn't mutant language. - we use a lot more profanity. - son of a... leela, take my hand! i'm slipping! the one time your hands aren't sticky, they're greasy! oh, sorry. normally i would've wiped them on my pants, but... - are you okay? - i... ow! my leg, it's broken. how'd you get down here? we made a rope from my shirt and jacket and an expedition flag from my underpants. i'll help you up. here, take my hand. stop telling me to take your hand. look, fry, your noble gestures keep making things worse. can't you just be a rude, unhelpful jerk like bender? when i use up the toilet paper, i don't put on a new roll. fry, my friend, i found your pants. and no sign of that crafty badger. all right! lucky pants! oh, my god! look what my flashlight found! a huge pyramid under new new york? what badger could've built this? and look at this intricately carved disk. it merits years of study. but how can we move such a fragile, precious... ancient history coming through! no, no, no, no, no! amazing! it appears to be some kind of extremely ancient calendar, predating even the girls of sumeria. of course. it's a mayan calendar. no, wait. there's some dried-up old stew on the screen. sorry. i was eating a can of breakfast and looking at porn. it's not mayan, it's martian! amy, you grew up on mars, right? - can you read martian? - a little. i only learned enough to yell at my nanny. let's see. i think it means, ""the sun will erupt, ""all shall perish,"" blah-blah-blah. get to the point! what does it say about me, bender? nothing! but it does say a great cataclysm will destroy the world in the year 3012! the world? that's where i live! told you it'd say something about me. so the world will end in 3012. why does that year sound so familiar? because that's the year that's this year! see? so, you all done with the computer? is it just me, or is the world ending more often these days? the calendar predicts fires, earthquakes, sharksplosions, then it just ends! exactly as the weather balloon foretold. before fry blew his pants out of the sky, it detected the onset of a catastrophic sunspot cycle. it's starting. this is the end of the world. coward man away! some of us were crazy before it was cool. evacuating the planet in three, two... so long, earth. thanks for nothing. it's not starting. come ons, comes on! let me try, headless clone of agnew. damn thing just won't turn over. it's like pat on a sunday morning. oh, the marconi is on the fritz, too! the electromagnetic storm is disabling all electronics on earth. hi, there. well, it wasn't a bad life. if only i could get back that time i spent watching tron: legacy. leela, i've made up my mind. before we die, i'm gonna find and destroy every remaining copy of tron: legacy. it may take a couple of hours, but... fry, stop trying to do things for me. whatever time we have left, just live it with me. so, you want to join the balcony club? the balcony club? i have an individual membership. - zoidberg, get lost. - i am lost. so long. stop the end-of-the-world sex. we might survive after all. all right, amy, what's so important that you interrupted my embalming? i translated more martian symbols. there's a way off this planet. that underground pyramid isn't a pyramid, it's a rocket ship! it was worth waiting five hours to hear you finish that sentence. a spaceship made of stone? with no electronics, it just might work! i'll stick with wind-up power, thank you very much. hmm. i've never flown a pyramid before, but i used to drive around town in a mausoleum. how many people can this thing carry? well, the mausoleum held 10 horny teenagers, so... maybe 30,000. it's our moral duty to save as many lives as possible. they had their chance. let's go! mind if i appear? welcome to the hidey house. brannigan, tell me about this freaky-deaky escape pyramid. i can fly it, sir. i just need to know where, and how. the obvious destination is mars. it's close, with lots of open space and no woodward or bernstein. that's a plus. but we can only save 30,000 people. how do we choose who goes? well, let's see now. we'll need leaders, scientists, doctors, bureaucrats, pilots, valuable appliances, even janitors. but that's it. no one else. i'll miss you, leela. but it's okay, 'cause then i'll die. cut the waterworks, hippie! the final decision will be made not by me, but by a cold, logical machine. who shall live and who shall die? step right up to the contrabulous choose-matron! i hate waiting in line to die. move it along, grandma. stick your hand in and take your chances. female, crotchety. needed to keep others in their place. accepted! damn straight, kajigger! ooh, me next! we just got one of these. rejected! male, scientist, fond of crazy contraptions. accepted! female, scientist. we were in the same sorority. accepted! - sigma beta, see you later! - sigma beta, see you later! male, medical doctor, delicious with butter and lemon. accepted! i wish they'd hurry. i want to get out of here before the mayhem starts. mayhem? there's gonna be mayhem? i'm staying. hoo-ee! well, might as well get it over with. delivery boy, no discernible skills. accepted! 'cause i like his pants. yes! my lucky pants! leela, we can go together after all. come on. get your badge. take my hand. top gun pilot, natural leader, extreme combat training. rejected! what? with all spaceships inoperable, we only need one spaceship pilot. wonder what this doo-cracky does? snake door. roger. you can't reject leela! give her a badge, you stupid box! male, filthy hand, violent temper. accepted again! no! fry, the box has spoken. go to mars. okay. will you at least keep this photo? remember how bender dumped all that pig's blood on me? you keep it. i'll remember you in here. i wish i could remember with my boobs. leela, we're off to mars. we'll see ourselves out. wait, i did it. i got leela a ticket. how did you do that? ah-ah-ah. a magician never reveals his secrets. except the great reveal-o. that guy stinks. i still don't see why you get the window seat. folks, this is your captain. our snake tanks are fully loaded, so once i figure out which button launches this... i figured it out! don't come back! well, let's get looting! fry, this is the most noble thing anyone has ever done for me. wait, fry? i'm a lot of people, but i'm not fry. oh, no! welcome to mars! it is with heavy heart and open arms that we receive earth's only survivors. admission, $20. dad! gleesh. greetings, mars men. we come to your planet to construct a gleaming city, a second earth on which to begin anew. okay. admission, $20. i can't believe it. fry sacrificed his spot for me, and i never even had a chance to thank him. don't worry, leela. earth is still there, peaceful and serene as ever. bender! you're stealing your own stuff! i am? geez, i better slow down. i'm stealing stuff i don't even need. - you want a torah? - nah, i'm not hungry. aw, what's the matter? scared of dying? no. 'cause as long as leela lives, i'll be alive, too, in her heart. but really i'll be dead. ladies and gentlemen, our new martian city is complete. i give you dickfrancisco! the doves didn't magically spring from my hand, but rather were crammed into this netting sewn into my sleeve! thank you, great reveal-o. and now, as a solemn testicle to those left behind on earth, i present this monument, titled simply, ""heroes."" that frightened little girl in the statue reminds me of fry. stop the ceremony. who is this non-washington redskin? i am singing wind, chief of the native martian tribe. but i thought your people abandoned this planet. we did. i just came back for my stuff. - what're you guys doing here? - fleeing earth, of course. we flew here in your great stone pyramid. seriously? that thing flies? of course. your people left it so we could escape. i translated your warning that the world was doomed. not your world. our world. we put calendar there to warn you not to visit mars. it mars that gonna be destroyed. why you think we so eager to abandon this dump? you guys got 10, 15 minutes max. well, so long. hey, ancient martian's a very hard language. - a... - looks just like a... - to the spaceship! - there is no spaceship. you had it dismantled to build that statue. to the statue. oh, what an idiot i was. and by ""i"", i mean ""you."" the final solar flare is going to bypass earth and strike mars. my god, one of the hundreds of contradictory prophecies is coming true. i should've known better than to trust one of fry's romantic gestures. every time he says he loves me, i get killed. it's just as i only now began to fear. the solar flares are igniting subsurface gas pockets. mars is being blasted out of its orbit. fry, you noble idiot. you're right, bender, grave robbing is fun. and these piña skulladas are fantastic. the crazy weather cleared up, too, for whatever reason. all in all, it's a fine day for an apocalypse. so you don't miss what's-her-name? of course i do. but even though we're millions of miles apart, somehow, i feel she's near me. very near! oh no! the kajigger of gibraltar! i have got to quit drinking. thanks, friend! another great thing was she always had room for dessert. we're passing surprisingly close to earth! when we reach 72nd street, jump! ah! cushiony. we made it. we're back home. okay, today is still a workday, so... wait! help! i'm still on mars, and i can't jump! hang on, leela! i'll save you again! or somebody else could do it! quick, take my hand. i don't know. bad things happen when you say that. - i got her! - ow! oops! - try again! - we're too far apart. no, we're not. grab your severed arm with your other arm. ew... okay. hurray! good thing scruffy rescued leela. don't thank me, thank the ladder. your cloned arms should be fully grown in a month or so. but for right now, enjoy the sounds of the world's smallest violin. i hope you're not too mad at me, leela, for tearing your arm off and all. i can't be mad. i'm on way too many painkillers. plus, you were willing to sacrifice yourself so i could live. i mean, you failed, miserably, but you're the only person who loves me enough to try. one last foolish gesture? uh..."
1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"[music playing] [organ music] mrs. farrow, i worked with your husband in the lab. he was a very fine chemist. i'll miss him very, very much at acme chemical. and so will i! you husband was a good man, elizabeth, and the finest chairman of the board our corporation ever had. i'm terribly sorry to hear about your husband, mrs. farrow. thanks. mm-mm! would you take a look at this! mm! [door shutting] oh, ray! oh, ray! he's dead! now we can be together forever! easy baby. easy! forever's a long time. let me take a look at that gorgeous face of yours first, hm? you ok, sugar? i am now, lover. just don't ever leave me! no way, sugar! no way. also in attendance at the services for professor farrow were doctors kitman and schrager, the late chemist's coworkers at the research division of acme chemical. the forward-thinking chemist was also chairman of the board and major stockholder of the acme chemical corp. he is survived by his wife, one-time high fashion model, elizabeth kendrake farrow. is that what it says, one-time fashion model? that's what it says, angel. people certainly do just love to talk, especially some of my close friends-- robbing the cradle, dear liz! ugh, they're awful! promise me you won't let that happen to us, ray! oh, come on, babe! what's a couple of years' difference between us mean, huh? a couple of years? that's sweet, but we both know it won't cut. it might work. if you are thinking about a face lift, forget it. the idea of surgery scares me to death. that's not what i had in mind. well, what then? a wig. a nice, silky blonde one-- you like, mamselle brigitte always wore? that was her own hair. nuh-uh. it just looked like her own. it was actually one of those expensive, custom-made jobs. it looked so good, you couldn't tell it from real-- not even one of those hollywood closeups. go on! well, my cousin mickey's wife, helen, she turned 40. and she looks 50. one day i'm over there visiting, see? and in walks this blonde bombshell. now, sugar, you know i'm not easily impressed, right? but this lady really had it! so i start making a move. oh, you did, did you? relax, babe! it was long before i ever met you! anyway, all of a sudden, my cousin mickey starts to laugh. i mean, the guy is practically on the floor. you know why? i haven't the vaguest idea. because the blonde bombshell was his wife, helen! i never recognized her. she was, like, transformed! she lost a few pounds. she got herself some skin treatments, some new clothes. and she started wearing that brigitte special, and wham! that lady lost 10 years-- maybe 15. i kid you not. well, my complexion is still pretty good. i wouldn't have any problems in that area. or any other area, as a matter of fact. did you say that she lost 10 years? even a little more. oh, if that was only possible! it is, babe! ray, would you help me? well, sure, sugar! we'll start work tomorrow. ray. thanks for helping me kill my husband. well, it wasn't anything, babe. all i did was mess around with his front brakes a little. that old cliff took care of the rest. i have something for you-- a present to show my appreciation. what's the key for? it's for our villa in the swiss alps, just like i promised! and next week, i'm having all of my money put in a swiss bank account. all of it? that's right! we're never going to have to come back here again, and you're never going to have to worry about money again, lover! [romantic music] oh my god! i'm sure it was fabulous. [laughter] hey, babe. pick a number from one to four. elizabeth: why? i'll tell you after. just pick. elizabeth: three. - three, huh? that's see you later! elizabeth: where you going? nowhere. see you later's the name of a horse. oo-ee! get a load of my baby! you are beautiful! you think so? you have been transformed, sugar! ray, how old do you think i look? i would say 30! cut it, ray! how old? 32, 33 the most. i'm being straight, beth. really? 33, huh? and falling fast. i'll tell you, baby. in a few weeks, they're going to be thinking i'm the one that's robbing the cradle. i knew it would work. you are a beautiful man, and a wonderful lover! 29-- that's how old we're both going to be by the time we leave for europe. 29, huh! that's right, babe. you'd better get used to the idea. [romantic music] my, uh, cousin ernie recommended you. ernie topps? uh-huh. listen, i want the lady to look good, you know? right. and younger. you got it! number two diffusion ought to do it. there ain't a hollywood actress over 30 that ever did a picture without one of these things attached to the camera. you could even make grandma moses look 15. all right, honey, let's go! [camera snapping] now that is nice! what do you think, beth? pretty good. pretty good? hey, babe, that's perfect! i tell you, the doctor that made out this birth certificate must have been chinese. you can hardly read any of it. so how's anyone ever going to know what's been changed? i guess so. hey, beth, relax! i mean, what difference does it make what age you put on a passport anyhow? it's not just my passport. i am now 29 on every piece of id that i own. suppose somebody finds out that it's not true! oh, now, babe, who is going to find out, especially in europe? and who'd care, anyway? - i guess you're right. - i'll see you later, babe. - ok. i'm going to take this all down to the passport office right now. [sigh] [cheery music] rebecca (voiceover): dear mrs. farrow, we wish to offer you the gift of beauty. we feel that the serenity of age is a myth created to ease the pain of growing old. how much better it would be to banish the pain by banishing age itself! and that is precisely what we offer. we can completely arrest the aging process-- in many cases, reversing its most noticeable signs. these are monumental claims, but we are prepared to prove them. this miraculous process is available to a select, hand-chosen few with the courage and will to remain young, vital-looking, and beautiful. you have but to make a single telephone call. it would then be our honor and privilege to send one of our beauty specialists to your home. there, in complete privacy, a secret which millions have striven for throughout the ages will be made available to you. flawless, timeless beauty can be yours forever. come on, babe! come on, you can do it! [panting] what airline did you say you're with? transnational. transnational, huh? are you based here in cali? yes, i am! ray: hey, maybe we can have a drink some time. woman jogger: perhaps. that sounds nice! [gasping] (shouting) ray! ray! what's the matter, babe? who's your friend? i never saw her before in my life! yeah? well, you'd never know it! you look so-- so cozy! oh, come on, beth! she's just a kid. exactly! and i'm not just a kid! i'm just someone who is breaking her back to look like a kid so that her young stud lover won't leave her for somebody who is just a kid! now, beth, that's not so. i'm not leaving for anywhere. come on, you're exaggerating. i am? uh-huh. you're beautiful, babe. and you're getting younger and more beautiful every day, so why should i run? well, what about in five years, ray, huh? we'll figure that out then. in the meantime, we'll keep working. i can't. i can't keep working! i'm exhausted! we'll take a few days off. that won't cut it, sweetheart. not at my age. like the man says, the spirit is willing, but the body keeps saying, whoa! [grunting] [sighs] [cheery music] rebecca (voiceover): we can completely arrest the aging process-- in many cases, reversing its most noticeable signs. you have but to make a single telephone call. [doorbell] hello, my name is rebecca, and i bring you the gift of beauty. well, hello. i'm elizabeth farrow. yes, i know. well, won't you come in? this is it! what a charming room! can i fix you a drink? no, thank you. well, why don't you put your bags down? they look very heavy. have a seat. i want to say that your company, miss-- moreau. oh, french! a long time ago, but please, call me rebecca. rebecca. what i meant to say is that your people certainly do know how to write a provocative letter! provocative perhaps, but completely true. before we go any further, mrs. farrow, permit me to extend my deepest condolences on the passing of your husband. i read about it in the newspaper. thank you, but please, call me elizabeth. elizabeth. thank you, elizabeth. miss moreau. rebecca: rebecca. rebecca! what exactly is it that you're offering? the dream of generations-- eternal beauty. eternal? rebecca: for all intents and purposes, yes. oh, well, i can hardly believe that! rebecca: only because you've been programmed not to believe it. what is aging? a slowing, a decay, a degeneration of faculty and function. these are all chemical reactions, and there are substances that can stop this breakdown. that's what i have in these bags, elizabeth. (whispering) may i see? i thought you'd never ask. see, it's largely a matter of relaxation. mm-hmm. and a positive attitude. what was in those bath salts? some herbs, a little lemon. like soaking in a giant cup of tea! stretch out. ok. this will deal with any character lines. mm, it's cool! it smells sort of like-- like ether. it has the same base. you may feel the slightest bit sleepy, but don't concern yourself. enjoy it! it's very important that this be done soon after your bath, when the pores are open. your late husband? elizabeth: yes, that's my husband. my late husband. you know, elizabeth, i feel a great affinity for you, and empathy, as it were. you see, the man i loved died of an unfortunate auto accident, just like your husband. claude. close your eyes and relax. are you feeling the tiniest bit drowsy? a little. ah! must have been the bath. there's a chance it might be a reaction to the lotion, but don't be concerned. it's funny the way different things affect different people. that's what i've always found so interesting about chemistry. your husband must have been fascinating when he spoke of chemistry. i wasn't particularly interested in my husband's work. that really is a shame! i think you would find it fascinating. for example, do you know what happens when ethyl chloride acts on a powdered alloy of lead and sodium? [chuckling] no, i'm afraid i don't. you get tel-- tetraethyl lead, the very substance i brushed on your face. oh, really? mm-hm. so you know what tel is used as? you'll never guess. what? go ahead, guess. no, no, no. tell me. i'm not very good at guessing games. you're not going to believe this. as an antiknock additive to gasoline. isn't that something? that's remarkable! now where did you get this fund of knowledge? from the man i worked with, the man i was hoping to marry. uh, the young man that was killed in the automobile crash? he really wasn't a young man. he was very mature. was he a chemist? oh, yes. a very good one. what was his name? at moments of high passion, i called him claudie. [dramatic music] [gasping] - what did you call him? you mean you were my-- my husband's mistress? yes, that's right! and i was his laboratory assistant for five years as well! that stuff, the tel? tetraethyl lead? it's-- it's-- it's not anything dangerous, is it? it's remarkably lethal. but only if-- if you swallow it, right? one of the most interesting things about tel is that it can be absorbed directly through the skin! isn't that fascinating? oh, my! works quite fast when the pores are nice and clean and open, sort of instant lead poisoning, working on the nervous system first. i'll bet you can't wiggle your toes. go ahead, try! (whispering) i can't! what did i tell you? you're not-- you're not serious, are you? you're not actually trying to murder me? i'm not trying. i already have. after all, you murdered claude. you cheated me out of any future i might have had with him, including financial security. what are you doing to me? i promised you eternal beauty, and i plan to deliver! do you have them? i surely do have them. here's your passport, and here's your swiss bank account id card. it's a good likeness. no one will ever know you're not mrs. elizabeth farrow, not even the tellers at that swiss bank. i know this may sound strange, but, well, thanks for your help. hey, babe, it beats spending 30 years to life in prison for murder! elizabeth: ray! [gasping] hey, i thought you said she'd be dead by now. rebecca: she will be. very soon. sorry, beth. she found out we killed claude. she was going to turn me in if i didn't help her, sugar. i know you can see that! say, did i ever tell you that i am a first-class cook and a top-notch chauffeur? not that i recall. why? well, now you're going to need some help out of that villa of yours, aren't you? you know, people you can trust. why don't we go somewhere and have a quiet little drink together? i'll bet you there are things we can talk about, find out ways we can be of help to each other.

1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0," last time on ""star trek - deep space nine"". i managed to save the dax symbiont. there was nothing i could do for jadzia. federation soldiers have landed on cardassia, now you say the wormhole is gone and with it any chance of getting reinforcements? the station's all yours, major. let's go home, jake. i need a first officer for a dangerous mission. it's dangerous enough to ensure jadzia a place in ""sto-vo-kor. "" i had a vision from the prophets. i was on tyree, in the desert, and i uncovered the face of a woman. - you had a wife before mum? - sarah was your mother. - evacuate immediately. - that's impossible. either you remove those weapons, or we will. - hello, benjamin. - do i know you? it's me. dax. and now, the continuation. dax? i can't believe it. i can hardly believe it myself. but i'm dax. i mean, i'm not jadzia dax. i'm ezri dax. but i have jadzia's memories. and lela's, tobin's, emony's, audrid's, joran's, curzon's... - am i forgetting anyone? - torias. right. you're probably asking yourself, who is this person? do i even want another dax in my life? these are good questions. i wish i had good answers. the answers can wait. right now, i'm just glad to see you. really? that is so nice of you to say. i'm not usually this emotional. it must be the emony in me. at least i think it's emony. - hi, jake. - hi. you seem taller. or am i shorter? none of this was my idea. i never wanted to be joined. - then how did you get the symbiont? - it was an accident. i was on the destiny when the symbiont was being taken back to trill. it took a bad turn and needed to be placed in a host immediately. and you were the only trill on board. i laid down as one person and woke up as a different person. well, eight different people. i was not prepared for this. you should get years of training before you get joined. all i got was a 15-minute lecture. i'm starting to see the problem. please. i feel so much better being here with you. couldn't the symbiosis institute do anything for you? i did meet with the evaluation board several times. and? they gave me some books to read, some counselling. but once a host and symbiont are joined, there's not much they can do. my parents, my friends, my crewmates... it's like they don't know me anymore, which is understandable since i hardly even know myself. that's why i took a leave of absence to come here. if anyone can help me through this, it's you. i'll do all i can. but the truth is, we're leaving for tyree. fine. i'll come with you. you don't even know why we're going. it doesn't matter. when do we leave? - today. - great. it'll be just like old times. except different. quark, son of keldar... - did i come at a bad time? - what's he doing here? same thing you are. i'm volunteering for this mission. why? you're a bartender, not a warrior. true, but i loved jadzia as much as anyone in this room. with maybe one or two exceptions. and i'm willing to pledge my life to see that she gets into ""sto-vo-kor. "" perhaps there is some klingon in you after all. i wouldn't go that far. so why all the cutlery? we shed our blood to prove we are not frightened of death. can't you just take my word for it? aargh! - that hurts. - it's supposed to hurt. - this is so embarrassing. - it's not your fault. i'm a starfleet officer. i have no business getting space sick. but since i got the symbiont, warp speed makes me a little queasy. a little? the control panel's all cleaned up, so if one of you would get back into the pilot's seat, it would sure make me feel better. - not that i don't trust the computer. - you just prefer the human touch. - do you need to lie down? - no, i'm fine. really. well, it's time for my nap. you're sure you're ok? but i wish i could stop thinking about torias. he was one of the previous hosts, wasn't he? he died in a shuttle accident. i still remember the last few seconds before the crash. maybe i don't belong in starfleet anymore. aren't you glad you brought me along? actually, i am. my dad seems a lot happier since you showed up. one iced ""raktajino. "" i know you're worried about your father, but he'll be fine. what makes you so sure? i've known him for a long time. and it's my job to know these things. i'm an assistant ship's counsellor. - you're a therapist? - is it that surprising? a little. you know, i wasn't always this confused. before i was joined i was considered a very promising young officer. that is horrible. i hate ""raktajino. "" - then why did you order it? - because curzon liked it. - so did jadzia. - well, i don't. i have to learn to control some of these urges. colonel, i'm as outraged as you are. the romulans had no right to place weapons on derna. - what are we going to do about it? - the federation has sent a protest. - what happens next? - they've sent a protest of our protest. - politics. - you haven't answered my question. eventually, the romulans will remove the weapons. when? are we talking days, weeks, months? - i don't know but it will happen. - now you sound like a politician. maybe so. but facts are facts, colonel. the bajorans can't drive the romulans off derna without help, and the federation isn't going to provide that help now. we're not as important to the war effort as the romulans. - that's a harsh way to put it. - the truth often is. i'd like to help you but my hands are tied. - luckily, mine aren't. - meaning what? the weapons aren't fully operational yet. they're still missing launch sequencers. i'll make sure they never reach derna. - how? - i'll set up a blockade. if you do that, you'll have a fight on your hands. a fight you can't win. we're entering orbit. prepare to beam down. why don't we use the ship's scanners to find the orb? the ionisation in the atmosphere will interfere with our sensors. you sure you don't want to stay here and wait for us? and miss all the excitement? not a chance. be sure you're carrying plenty of water. you, too. it's dry down there. dr wykoff, please report to isolation ward 4. dr wykoff, please report to isolation ward 4. - did you hear that? - hear what? forget it. if there's an orb buried around here, my tricorder's not picking it up. it's out there someplace. that's why the prophets sent me here. did they give you any hint of which way to go? that way. - the prophets have spoken. - i hope he heard them right. once we're close enough, we can fire an em pulse at the sun. i thought we were trying to destroy a shipyard. if you understand what he's talking about, can you explain it? we are going to fly so close to the heart of the sun that our ship will glow like a flaming comet. hopefully not that close. close enough to trigger a solar plasma ejection. it should incinerate anything within 100 million kilometres. including the shipyard. the glorious firestorm will illuminate the gates of ""sto-vo-kor"" and provide a fitting welcome for jadzia. the things we do for love. - did you see that? - see what? - the way he glared at me. - he always glares at you. i'm sick of it. we're risking our lives for jadzia. the very least worf could do is show us some appreciation. - is it so hard to say thank you? - thank you. nice try but i want to hear it from him. - don't do this, quark. - do what? all i'm asking for is two little words. - be quiet. - that's two words all right. just not the two i was hoping for. why should i feel any gratitude toward you? i owe you nothing. you are not here to help jadzia get into ""sto-vo-kor. "" you are here to convince yourselves that you are worthy of her. but none of you could ever hope to be worthy of her or even understand the kind of woman she was. it is you who should be thanking me, ferengi, for allowing you to come on this mission and pay honour to her memory. - think we're getting close? - i have no idea. - but we're headed the right way? - i hope so. audrid loved to walk. she preferred the woods. nice shady glens, cool breezes, cold streams. - what are you trying to say? - we've been keeping a fast pace. we should give your father and jake a rest. if they want a break, they can go back. i think we should stick together. - dad, how are you doing back there? - never better. soon we'll break through enemy lines. then we can drive the alliance out of cardassian territory. - a bit more ""kanar?"" - please. to victory. on all fronts. damar, have you... weyoun, this is siana. we met at the dinner last night honouring legate hovas. damar, you and i have things to discuss, things that your guest doesn't want to hear. and why is that? because if she does, i'll be forced to have her executed. i really should be going. until tonight. what a pleasant woman. now... we must increase production at the monac shipyard. we need more assault ships to retake the chin'toka system. damar, are you listening to me? increase production. yes, i heard you. by how much? - 15% would be ideal. - that won't be easy. i'm sure you'll find a way. you're very resourceful. a blockade? how many ships are we talking about? twelve impulse ships. that's all the council could spare. how effective do you think they'll be against even one romulan warbird? you sound like admiral ross. i was hoping our relationship would be a long and happy one but i suppose i'm willing to settle for short and exciting. i take it you're going to be commanding the blockade? - that's right. - then i'm going to be there with you. - you don't have to do that. - yes, i do. well, i wouldn't start writing our epitaphs just yet. i'll wait until the first wave of romulan ships decide to run the blockade. i don't intend to get into a fire fight with a squadron of romulan warbirds. - you mean you're bluffing? - if the romulans fire on us, they jeopardise our alliance. i'm hoping that's a risk they don't want to take. and i'm hoping they don't call your bluff. you sure you don't want to go up to the runabout? we started this together, we'll finish it together. i owe it to ben. i got you. let's go. dr wykoff, please come to isolation ward 4 immediately. to isolation ward 4. dr wykoff. dr wykoff. please come to isolation ward 4 immediately. benjamin. benjamin. - is this it? - i think so. you're not sure? ben, that's not good enough. ben. are you listening to me? - there. - where? that's where we start digging. why there? i wasn't even aiming at anything. maybe my memories are playing tricks on me but have you got stranger? ship's log, stardate 52152.6. we've set up a blockade around derna. no romulan ships have tried to challenge it. ""kiss me deadly. "" interesting title. the book isn't bad. i think you'll enjoy it. is this the right time to start reading a book? maybe not, but i know how much you hate waiting and mike hammer has certain qualities i think you'll appreciate: he's as tough as they come and he hates waiting as much as you do. i like him already. colonel, there's a transmission from deep space 9. it's admiral ross. put him through. colonel, 14 romulan warbirds are on their way to derna. they'll arrive in eight hours with medical supplies. when did the romulans start using warbirds to deliver medical supplies? we want to make sure they arrive safely. they won't get through the blockade. that kind of talk won't help. you want to avoid a confrontation, not provoke one. the romulan ships aren't a peace offering. i wasn't happy to hear about that either. but we only have a few hours to reach a compromise. - then people will start dying. - talk about compromise all you want. any ship attempting to break through the blockade will be fired upon. do you think your impulse ships stand a chance against our warbirds? we'll find out soon enough, won't we? end transmission. - how did i do? - mike hammer would've been proud. - you're concerned. - aren't you? not really. the colonel is brave woman, but she's not stupid. she's bluffing. right over there in the shade. here. there you go, grandpa. dr wykoff, please come to isolation ward 4. dr wykoff to isolation ward 4. - i wish he'd get there. - who? dr wykoff. they're waiting for him in the isolation ward. you have definitely gotten stranger. what about me? would you rather i hadn't come on this mission? that is not what i am saying. you are different. you are a klingon and jadzia was a member of your house. these men were her friends. they honour her with their presence. ""gagh"" for breakfast, ""gagh"" for lunch, ""gagh"" for dinner. klingon menus need to have more variety. you can complain about the ""gagh. "" but don't complain in the mess hall surrounded by klingons. all right, i get the point. but i think some of those klingons agreed with me. worf, if this has anything to do with what happened in the mess hall... no, it does not. come up with a few more insults to throw at us? - i wish to apologise. - i'm listening. jadzia meant a great deal to all of you and you meant a great deal to her. when we discussed our day, she would repeat something that you had told her, or describe the intricacies of some new scheme of yours. she often talked about all of you. it seemed as though even when we were alone, one of you was always with us. you were jealous. she liked us better than you. quark, would you please keep quiet? she was my wife, my ""par'machkai. "" i did not like having to share her affections. that's why you didn't want us on this mission. you wanted to get her into ""sto-vo-kor"" without our help. i wanted it to be my gift to her. go on. there is nothing more to say. except that i am pleased you are here. i have never heard worf apologise to anyone. i don't know about you, but i was hoping for something a little more... intriguing. such as? you know, like... jadzia used to call my name out when she slept. or wanted to name her first child after me. chief. the monac shipyard. - impressive. - display our target. how close do we have to get to that? - too close. - perfect. - have you found something? - stay back. the orb of the emissary. - what are you going to do? - open it. mr russell. mr russell, put it down. benjamin, what's wrong? benjamin. i said put down the pencil. - put it down, mr russell. - but i haven't finished my story yet. captain sisko has found the orb of the emissary. but he hasn't opened it yet. mr russell, you promised not to write on the walls. no one will give me any paper... we agreed that you weren't going to write. - that you needed to rest. - i need to tell my stories. you were doing so well, benny. making real progress. - we were all so proud of you. - i need to go home. - you'll go home when you're well. - i'm fine! people who are fine don't write on walls. then get me a typewriter. the stories must stop. they're too dangerous. - too dangerous to whom? - to you. this world you've created, this deep space 9, captain sisko, kira and the others. none of it is real. it is to me. if i don't finish my story, if sisko doesn't open the orb box, then he cannot contact the prophets. it doesn't matter, benny. the prophets don't exist. they're figments of your imagination. get rid of them. it's the only way you'll get well. - now give me the pencil, benny. - but my story! it's over. let it go. what are you waiting for? open it. that's why we're here. he can't hear you. jake! - jake, are you all right? - yeah. ship's log, supplemental. senator cretak said the warbirds would be here in eight hours. she was wrong. they're two hours early. they'll be in weapons range in eight minutes. - open a channel. - go ahead. this is colonel kira of the bajoran militia. any ship within transporter range of derna will be fired upon. they're not responding. kira to all bajoran ships. prepare to engage. - admiral ross wants to speak to you. - put him through. i'm appealing to you to end this blockade. you know i can't do that, admiral. i will use whatever force is necessary to see that our medical supplies reach their destination. however, i may also seek a negotiated settlement. my government has made its position quite clear. there will be no negotiations as long as there are weapons on derna. if you open fire on those ships, we all lose. to beat the dominion we must keep our alliance intact. i'd hate to see you throw your life away. your concern is touching, senator. but i'm not dead yet. end transmission. at least not for another six minutes. - you still think she'll back down? - she has to. because i won't. take me out of the oven, moogie. i'm cooked. i've found the magnetic instability near the sun's equator. let's trigger that solar ejection and go. the ejection has to have the right trajectory to destroy the shipyard. - how do we do that? - we have to get closer. much closer. he's right. ""sto-vo-kor,"" here we come. - take it, benny. - what for? i'm offering you the opportunity to wipe away all your mistakes. - you want me to paint over my story? - they're only words. meaningless words that no one cares about. get rid of them and you can walk out of here a free man. go ahead. save yourself. - ben? - got to cover it up. bury it. ben, what are you doing? it's for your own good, benny. wipe away the words. destroy them before they destroy you. ben, stop! the romulans have powered their weapons. - they're calling your bluff. - auxiliary power to forward shields. kira to all ships. hold your positions. nerys, if you're going to end this, i suggest you do it now. time to fold, colonel. damn it. we're ready, general. decloak and prepare to fire. on worf's command. fire! it didn't work. - oh, well. we tried. time to go. - no! not until we complete our mission. we'll have to increase the magnetic gradient. no time. three jem'hadar ships are approaching, bearing 005, mark 190. i suggest you work quickly, chief. no! get out of my way. you came here to find the prophets, remember? move! you promised jadzia you'd make things right. now is your chance. open the box, ben. no! colonel, do we stand down? we're getting a transmission from deep space 9. the wormhole. it's back! on screen. nerys? open a channel to all bajoran ships. hold your positions and prepare to fire on my command. lock targets. - still glad you came? - i wouldn't have missed it. i'm afraid the colonel has run out of time. worf, did i not promise you a glorious battle? it is everything i hoped for. em pulse ready, general. - what are you waiting for? fire! - by all means, chief. fire! - it's working! - great. now can we leave? full impulse. qapla'! - i'm sure jadzia appreciates all this. - i'm sure she does. nerys, they're pulling back. admiral ross would like to speak with you. put him through. you can blink now, colonel. you've won. - the senator will remove the weapons. - what changed her mind? i told her that if she didn't remove them, i would. - and what changed your mind? - you did. remind me never to play poker with you. show yourselves. i've come to speak with you. the sisko has completed his task. sarah? the kosst amojan no longer threatens us. you mean the ""pah-wraith?"" it's no longer in the wormhole? i have cast it out. did the prophets send me to tyree to release you from the orb? the kosst amojan tried to stop you with a false vision. but you did not waver. you fulfilled your destiny. my destiny? you talk as if my life is over. the sisko must still face many tasks. you won't tell me what they are? the emissary is corporeal. linear. - linear or not, i need some answers. - the sisko is intrusive. are you sarah sisko? are you my mother? sarah sisko was corporeal. for a time, i shared her existence. you took over her body, made sure she married my father... so that she'd give birth to me. the sisko is necessary. and once you didn't need her anymore, you left her. no wonder she walked out on my father. she didn't choose him. you did. the sisko would prefer different answers. what you're saying isn't easy to accept. you arranged my birth. - i exist because of you. - the sisko's path is a difficult one. but why me? why did it have to be me? because it could be no one else. benjamin? that must've been some orb experience. i'll tell you about it someday. - welcome back, captain. - we missed you. thank you for bringing the prophets back. i heard you've all been pretty busy yourselves. odo! nerys! julian! it's so good to see you. - worf, we need to talk. - who's that? - it's dax. - dax? that's right, ezri dax. incredible, isn't it? - it cannot be. - she's so much shorter. just when you thought things couldn't get more interesting."
0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0," - how long was i asleep? - almost two hours. are we close to home? we entered the bajoran system a few minutes ago. what's that? the shopkeeper i bought it from called it a ""knickknack"". - i didn't know you collected them. - it's a present for kira. oh! you don't think she'll like it? i'm sure she will. it's just that i didn't get anything for keiko. the conference kept you pretty busy. you found time to get something. - not chocolates as well. - rigelian chocolates. her favourite. - i'll buy them from you. - pardon? i'll buy them from you. she doesn't need two presents. i'm sorry, miles, but the answer is no. - there's something behind us. - it's gaining on us fast. - you think it's friendly? - i hope so. it's certainly taken an interest in us. uh-oh. - it's gone. - what? - there's nothing out there. - where did it go? it's a changeling. stay where you are or i'll fire. - you. you are a metamorph? - i'm a changeling, yes. tell the mono-form to put down its weapon. - why did you board our ship? - because i sensed you were here. i had to see if it were true, if i'd finally found another metamorph. you've never met another shape-shifter? i've been trying to find others for a long time. stay where you were. - how do we know he's not a founder? - he's not. - he's one of the hundred. - the hundred? over the centuries, our people sent 100 infant changelings into the galaxy. we were to learn about other species and later share what we'd experienced. that would explain why i was alone on varala. i didn't even know what i was at first, or that i could assume other forms. i was the same way. shouldn't we get him into a containment field until we know he's telling the truth? i'll allow myself to be taken prisoner to show my good faith, but only if you vouch for my safety. i do not trust humanoids. so where is he now? in a holding cell. captain, he's not a threat to us. he's travelled a long way to find out where he came from. - you believe his story? - yes. how can we be sure he's not a founder? if he were, he'd be infected with the disease that's afflicting the link. dr bashir scanned him. his morphogenic matrix is as stable as mine. sir, with your permission, i'd like to release him. well, i'm sure you can appreciate why i'd have reservations about that. we're still at war with your people. the founders have deceived us before. i realise that. but he is not a founder. he's one of the hundred, i'm sure of it. sir, i'm asking you to trust me on this. all right, constable. i'll release him into your custody. thank you, sir. when i found out our people were the leaders of the dominion, i realised i had no place with them. this war they're fighting is wrong. i can understand their distrust of humanoids, but why conquer them? better to avoid them altogether. you don't much care for humanoids. i know from experience they don't much care for changelings. i think you'll find the people here are different. - they accepted me. - have they? is that why you've stayed? i told you, i want no part of the founders. but what about the hundred that were sent out? haven't you ever tried to find them? no. it's a huge galaxy. they could be anywhere. i found you. i have a life here. i have friends. when did you first assume humanoid form? a little over 30 years ago. so that's it. it's all still so new to you. i spent time living among humanoids, as well. - how long ago was that? - over 200 years. i must have been sent out earlier than you. or it could be that i was adrift for a long time before i was found. either way, it explains why you've chosen to stay here. i too was fascinated by humanoid life in the beginning. - but you lost interest. - i found it limiting. the varalans never accepted me as one of them and i was never able to fully mimic their appearance. - faces aren't easy. - no. and humanoids are not very tolerant of difference. some of them are. there are dozens of species on this station. they tolerate each other's differences very well. he has bumps on his forehead. she has a wrinkled nose, but they're basically alike. they are bipeds that eat, sleep, breathe. you and i are nothing like them. we're changelings. we can be like them when we choose. i choose to be like them as little as possible. that's where we differ. let me show you where you'll be staying. you haven't told me your name. the varalans called me laas. it means ""changeable"". - not very imaginative. - but it's appropriate. mine is ""unknown sample"". the man who found me didn't know what i was. these are my quarters. i'll be staying... somewhere else. feel free to shape-shift as you please. some of these forms are interesting. this hasn't been used in some time. i've... been busy. who is this? - her name is kira. - ah. - i had a mate once. - oh? on varala. not long after i first assumed humanoid form. and? what happened? we couldn't have children. that was important to her. is it something that matters to this kira? - we've never discussed it. - neither did we, at first. do our people reproduce? it's complicated. in our natural state, we don't exist as separate entities. i don't understand. our people spend most of their time in the link. it involves a melding into one, a merging of thought and form, idea and sensation. you're speaking in riddles. - it's difficult to explain. - then don't. show me. of course. take it. for the first time in my life, i understand how i was meant to exist. you've given up a great deal to remain here. yes. yes, i have. but i won't have anything to do with the founders' war. odo, we linked. i know the truth. you stayed here because of kira. if it weren't for her, you would be with our people. war or no war, you would be a founder. - hi. - hello, nerys. i can't believe it. another changeling! what's he like? he's... complicated. like you. - are you all right? - i'm fine. you seem far away. we linked. - i see. - there's nothing to worry about. he's not trying to lure me to the dominion. the link is part of what we are. it comes as naturally to us as talking does to humanoids. it's a little more personal than talking, isn't it? i suppose. so. do i get to meet him? - if you like. - i would. then i'll arrange it. here they are. this is laas. - nerys. - julian. - ezri. - miles. - we've met. - look, i'm sorry. we didn't know who you were. you gave us quite a scare. i've always wondered how it would feel to be able to fly through space like that. it's a shame you're incapable of experiencing it. guess so. - tell us about varala. - no federation ship's been. it's just like any other planet overrun with humanoids. cities and farms everywhere, other lifeforms displaced. once i migrated to the southern continent with a herd of ""volg. "" when we later returned to our breeding grounds, they had been fenced off. the herd died out within two generations. it's the same wherever humanoids thrive. they disrupt the natural balance. - who ordered the vilm steak? - ah. um... you better keep that warm. whatever you say. the truth is, i prefer the so-called primitive lifeforms. they exist as they were meant to, by following their instincts. no words get in the way. no lies. no deceptions. we're not the ones who can disguise ourselves as anything we want. - meaning? - shape-shifters are not to be trusted. - i trust odo. - of course you trust odo. look at him. you've convinced him he is as limited as you. - laas. - you've seen through our evil plan. - foiled again. - it's not funny. no. i'm very worried for him. odo can take care of himself. thank you, colonel. well. this has been... interesting. if you'll excuse us, colonel, counsellor, doctor, chief. laas. nice to see you again. this way. - did you have to insult them? - i was just speaking my mind. - you could call it that. - humanoids are tragic. they can't take joy in simply existing, yet their consciousness can't exist independent of form. you're not afraid to make generalisations. i've been many things. i speak from experience. enough talk. link with me. - here? - why not? - that's not a good idea. - are you embarrassed? no. you don't want to remind them that you're not a humanoid. i don't go out of my way to point it out, no. are you afraid they will reject you? i don't like to confront people and make them uncomfortable. so you deny your true nature in order to fit in. you're reading too much into it. before i came here, when was the last time you assumed another form? you can't even remember. you've pretended to be humanoid for so long you forget you can be different. that's not true. i've been involved with other things lately. like courting kira? she can't even link with you. - leave her out of this. - it won't last. the fact that your relationship failed doesn't mean that mine will. true. and if you're very lucky, you can watch her grow old and die. i think you should stay out of my affairs. i don't want to see you make the same mistakes i made. you're wasting your time trying to be a humanoid. you're limiting yourself. let's leave here, odo. let's find the others. a hundred were sent away and they're out there somewhere. if we can find even a few of them, we can form a new link. think of it. we can exist the way we were meant to. as changelings. i can't believe he actually thought you'd leave with him. he just can't understand why i want to stay here. how did he take it when you said no? you did say no, didn't you? i told him i'd think about it. i didn't want to dismiss it out of hand. he would've taken offence. why do you look at me like that? it just bothers me that he thinks you're not happy here. it makes me think he knows something that i don't. what makes you say that? he linked with you. something gave him the impression that you might want to leave. it's just wishful thinking on his part. the thought of the two of us looking for the others, exploring the galaxy as changelings. it's very alluring. to him. sounds like it's alluring to you, too. i'm happy here. i'm sorry i can't link with you. it doesn't matter, nerys. i love you. computer, activate fire suppression sys... laas? i need to talk to you. you didn't realise it was me. did you even know we could exist as fire? i didn't think so. no matter. once we're away, i'll teach you to be things you've never dreamed of. i'm not leaving. i'm staying here. why? so you can keep on pretending to be one of them? i'm sorry if you're disappointed. i'll survive. and when i find some of the others, i'll send for you. you'll change your mind. you'll join us. it could take a long time for you to find another changeling. is that supposed to discourage me? all i'm saying is you don't have to leave right away. i wouldn't mind the company of another changeling. you wouldn't either. all right, odo. i won't abandon you to these mono-forms. as a favour to you, i'll stay a while. you might as well. if you can't get along with me, you may not get along with any other changeling. just remember, i have no interest in mono-forms, even if they are your friends. i don't think you have to worry about an overcrowded social schedule. good. - the environmental system's out. - there goes our holosuite reservation. - i'll go see what it is. - it's not the environmental system. - then where's this fog coming from? - it's not fog. it's laas. - laas? - what's he doing? being fog, what's it look like? - can't he be fog somewhere else? - or when no one's around? - he's not hurting anyone. - still. it's creepy. - careful, miles. he might hear you. - good. laas. laas. congratulations. you've managed to disrupt the entire promenade. - i was just relaxing. - if you want to relax, do it in private. did i embarrass you? - what is this founder doing here? - he's not a founder. move along. don't change form in my presence again. i will change form where i please. - look at the hate in his eyes. - laas. your hands are stained with the blood of klingons. but then, the stench would still be on them. mine's bigger. no! no! dr bashir wasn't able to save the klingon's life. general martok has asked that laas be detained until the magistrate can determine jurisdiction. - the klingons want to extradite him. - he killed in self-defence. - that is in dispute. - he was drawing his disruptor. he was reaching for his dagger. - you say that's not true? - it happened too fast. but their intentions were obvious. the klingons say laas knew he couldn't be harmed by a knife, so he wasn't justified in using deadly force. the klingons have resorted to legal quibbling? they get involved in fights all the time. they never file charges. they're now exercising their rights under the law. sir, they're only doing this because they distrust changelings. - he should not have provoked them. - provoked them? they attacked laas. they claim he ""surrounded them menacingly"". they felt menaced by fog? they weren't the only ones. twelve other people filed complaints. is it a crime to shape-shift on the promenade? it's not a crime, but it's obviously not a good idea. you're going to extradite him, knowing the klingons won't give him a fair trial. that's up to the magistrate. you'd just as soon be rid of him. you didn't want him here. i had to beg you to release him. that's enough, constable. martok has expressed concerns about our security arrangements. meaning? he's not sure it's appropriate that you're in charge of the prisoner. may i ask why? because you were a witness to the alleged crime. that's a relief. for a moment i thought you were going to say it's because i'm a changeling. odo. i heard the klingons want to put your friend on trial. they're the ones who should be on trial. if they'd attacked anyone else, they would be. you're probably right. that fog episode certainly didn't help. - laas was doing what comes naturally. - you never pulled a stunt like that. people don't want to be reminded that you're different. who wants to see somebody turn into goo? - i hope you don't do that around kira. - why shouldn't i? if she's anything like me, she'd rather you didn't. don't you get it? humanoids are a product of millions of years of evolution. our ancestors learned that what you don't know might kill you. they had to jump back when they encountered a snake. millions of years later, that instinct is still there. it's genetic. our tolerance to other lifeforms doesn't extend beyond the two arm, two leg variety. i hate to break this to you, but when you're in your natural state... ...you're more than our poor old genes can handle. what are you saying, quark? that the klingons couldn't help what they did? i'm not trying to excuse what they did. i'm only telling you why it happened. watch your step, odo. we're at war with your people. this is no time for a changeling pride demonstration on the promenade. - constable. - i need time alone with the prisoner. sorry, sir. i have my orders. - i don't know what to say. - you could say you were wrong. you could say the people here are no different than any other humanoids. this will all get straightened out at your hearing. i'm sure it will be fair and impartial. just tell them exactly what happened. my word against a humanoid's? whom do you think this magistrate will believe? i shouldn't have convinced you to stay. if i had just let you go, none of this would've happened. my only consolation is that this may finally make you understand that you don't belong here. you saw the hatred in that klingon's eyes. perhaps now you'll recognise it when you see it hiding in the faces of your so-called friends. they tolerate you, odo, because you emulate them. what higher flattery is there? ""i, who can be anything, choose to be like you. "" but even when you make yourself in their image, you are not one of them. they know that what you appear to be does not reflect what you really are. it's only a mask. what lies underneath is alien to them. and so they fear it. and that fear can turn to hate in the blink of an eye. they're going to extradite him. i know they are. - no one will do anything to stop it. - there's not much anyone can do. if he weren't a changeling they would. - that's unfair. - is it? you sound like laas. maybe i'm starting to see things more clearly now. look at me, nerys. what do you see? - i see you. - no. this is just a form i've borrowed. i could just as easily be something else. i know that. but this is what you have always chosen to be. a man. a good and honest man. a man i fell in love with. are you telling me that he never really existed? i don't know. i care for you more than anyone i've ever known. these last few months have been the happiest of my life. but even so, part of me wishes that laas and i were out there right now, searching for the others, existing as changelings. because that's what i am. not a humanoid. i'm a changeling. then maybe you're right. maybe you do belong out there. - can i help you, colonel? - i need to talk to the prisoner. alone. aye, sir. go to the third planet in the koralis system. there's an orbital tether running down to a mining complex. - i'll tell odo to meet you there. - is this some kind of a trick? do you want to get out of here or not? that vent will lead you through some conduits to an airlock. why? i love him. escaped? how did he get through the containment field? all i can tell you is what i saw. he turned into plasma energy and forced his way through. before i could stop him, he'd disappeared. one of the airlocks was activated shortly after that. why didn't our sensors detect him? a freighter left about the same time. - he must have shadowed it. - he could be anywhere by now. general martok won't be happy. by fleeing, he has demonstrated his guilt. either that, or his lack of faith in our justice system. he must be brought to trial. have all available runabouts begin a sector-wide search. aye, sir. good luck. constable, i know it's a long shot, but i'm sure you agree we should try to find him. - of course. - dismissed. level 9. you didn't hide it very well. that you're glad he escaped. i should've known he'd be able to escape. what's a forcefield to a changeling with his abilities? you said you wished you were out there with him. well, it's not too late. i don't understand. he's waiting for you at an abandoned mine on koralis lll. you helped him escape. i don't want you to stay here out of some sense of obligation. good luck. i hope you find what you're looking for. laas? i knew you would come. this is a new beginning for us, odo. a new beginning for our people. you and i are about to embark on the adventure of our lives. - what's wrong? - i'm not going with you. why are you here? i've come to say goodbye. don't be a fool. what are you holding on to? kira? she knows that this is what's best for you. why else would she have helped me escape? you really don't know, do you? you've no idea what it means to love someone enough to let them go. she let you go so that you could find out where you belong. i know where i belong. laas, humanoids are not the petty creatures you perceive them to be. what nerys did should prove that even to you. love conquers all, is that it? i'm sorry you can't understand. you've done many things, been many things... ...but you've never known love. compared to the link, it is a pale shadow, a feeble attempt to compensate for the isolation mono-forms feel because they are trapped within themselves. perhaps the fact that it's not easy is what makes it worthwhile. odo, the founders are dying. this could be your last chance to exist the way you were meant to. don't throw it away. you'd better go. they're looking for you. good luck. and to you, odo. you'll need it more than i. watch over him. help him find his way. yes. i didn't think i'd see you again. i couldn't go. if i've ever made you feel that you couldn't be yourself with me, i'm sorry. i want to know you. the way you really are."

""mr. and mrs. alan ransome,"" is that what it says? ""new york, southampton."" ""two one-way..."" toby, toby, you're not gonna reading the small print. these seem to be in order, millie. thank you. i'm glad to know that. no, but i tell you, there's a mistake. this is what you might call a private party, a private... an excursion. a mistake. a terrible mistake. millie, millie, come along, come along. i guess that means welcome well, don't let him get your back up. you'll be twice as cranky when you're his age. you can still turn back, you know. just think of being cooped up with me for 14 days. i made a promise, i'm going to go through with it. isn't that good enough? sure, sure, sure. at leasttry to enjoy yourself. one moment, please. your names? ransome. you want to see our tickets, too? no, sir, that's quite all right. thank you. state room 24 is down that flight of stairs there and to your left. you're not going to let him do this? i'm afraid it's out of my hands, sir. come on, come on. let's check the room, see if they got the luggage in. we're due to take off in ten minutes. take off? leave, sail. depart. depart, depart. i don't believe it. oh, alan! alan, isn't it marvelous? oh, alan, the bed! oh, isn't it wonderful? oh, and stairs! look, you have to go up and down to get in. this is probably the most ridiculous room probably? probably?! it is! and you like it, huh? oh, yes, yes, i like it! don't you? no kidding. can we even take this for two whole weeks? i mean... alan, alan, the whistle! come on, come on, let's go up on deck. why? why? because that's what people do. haven't you ever seen any movies? here they are. those are the ones i mean- they're coming with us. nonsense. it's obviously a silly blunder. i tell you, i've seen their tickets. all right, keep calm. there's plenty of time. i want to see it from the top deck. you young people are probably unaware of the fact that this is a sort of, uh, private cruise. yes. quite... there must be a slip-up somewhere. oh, no. there hasn't been any slip-up. this is our ship and we're sailing to europe on it. her. oh, her. there you are, you see. oh, dear. this is very bad news indeed. oh, really? this may sound odd to you, but, really, we want to help you. exactly. you see, there are certain things you don't know about the ship. now, what does that mean? well, for instance, it isn't generally known... no, no, no, careful, careful. no, no, no. no, no, my dear gentleman, i must tell them. the ship is over 50 years old. oh, we knew that. oh, well, then, uh, possibly one or two things you don't know because you haven't looked. she's falling apart. even the chairs... they wouldn't bear the weight of a baby. and the staircase, the staircase- look at it- likely to collapse any moment. and the food- you won't be able to eat it. it'll poison you, you get to main. so you can see how impractical the whole idea is, can't you? uh-huh. uh, there's just one thing. huh? if this is such an awfully dangerous boat, what are you two doing on it? uh, uh... oh, well, we're old and eccentric. we're... young and eccentric. we like impractical things. and besides, we think that this is an absolutely that's the last warning. they'll be taking the gangplank down any moment. you'll get seasick, you know. no stabilizers. she rolls like an old washing machine. well, it sounds like fun! for pete's sake, will you two gentlemen... just a moment, please. now, what's that for? i'm prepared to pay you double the amount of your tickets if you'll abandon your plans. well? not a chance. all right, then i'll triple the amount. no. mrs. ransome, you're driving me to extremes. however, if you leave thelady annenow, i'll give you the equivalent of 5,000 american dollars. and i'll match that. making it a total of 10,000. well, now you gentlemen are talking my language. shall we make it an even 100,000? good gracious, we don't have that sort of money. sorry, no deal. oh, no, no, please reconsider. you don't understand. now look, my dear sir, ever since we picked this tub, people have been trying their best i don't know why and i don't care. but if you're worried that the brash americans are going to try to crash your cozy little tea party, forget it. no, laddie, it isn't that at all. forget it. and leave us alone. you thought i'd take the money, didn't you? i honestly didn't know. oh, look, alan! we're off to a great start. well... we tried. we should have tried harder. we should have kept them off alan? alan? oh, alan. what are you doing up so early, hmm? it's almost 11:00. so...? good morning. good morning. all right. you're not getting nervous already, are you? no. come on, alan, let's not let two cranky old men spoil our honeymoon. how many? hmm? get dressed. fire drill's in 15 minutes. oh, alan, i wish you would tell me what this is all about. i feel as though i'm climbing the scaffold on my way to my execut... all right, pay attention, please. call for fire drill practice. oh, alan. now, see to it that your straps are firmly pulled across the chest and tied. and that the jackets fit snugly across your body. alan, you don't suppose that everybody... everybody. i checked this morning. i didn't see a person under 75. oh, that's silly. it must just be the first class section. there's only one section, it's all first class. do you mean that... that they're the only... now, then... in the event that the balloon should go up, the alarm will sound. in a calm and orderly fashion, you will don your belts- over there, please- and assemble here, ""b"" deck, where you will await further instructions. groups will be divided up in the following manner: group ""a,"" mr. and mrs. hunter small, mr. and mrs. mckenzie, mr. and mrs. scott esprey... now, remember, dear, getting there is half the fun. looks like we're on time for the orgy. shh. this isn't a boat, it's a floating rest home. alan. bartender. could you fix us up with a couple of double martinis, very dry? could i have one? alan? hmm? i'm sorry. i didn't know it was going to be like... like this. yeah. no, i really mean it. i am sorry. listen, you know, it really doesn't make that much difference. i mean, we really didn't want to what we really wanted... stop saying ""we,"" will you? if you'd listened to me, we'd be in london right now. yeah, and you'd be at a business conference. no. yes. thank you. thank you. and you would be there the next day oh, alan, that's what this trip is all about. don't you see that? look, i know you've been unhappy. but do you think i enjoy working 28 hours a day? well, it comes to the same thing, doesn't it? we never see each other, we never talk, we never... look, i told you before right after i put this deal across, i'm going to start taking it easy. oh, sure, sure. that's what you said two years ago. and you put the deal across and it didn't make any difference because there are always more deals and there will always be more deals because that's all that matters to you anymore, isn't it? isn't it?! could i have another drink, please? you're supposed to sip those things, not guzzle them down. i'll tell you something, i am so tired of begging for a little bit of your time. you're not interested in me anyway. you are interested in success. you have to fight to get to the top, and then you have to fight to stay there. and you just fight, fight, fight. stop making a scene. why? does it take your mind off mergers and board meetings? no, it takes my mind off the fact that i was supposed to be taking a trip and having a good time. oh, come on, alan, you took me on this trip because i asked to be taken, that's all. otherwise, you would have gone alone. now, isn't that right? i want you to admit that. isn't that right? isn't that the truth? i cannot talk to you when you act like this. i cannot talk to you. you don't care about me anymore. oh, i was really stupid to think that, uh, that a few days alone was going to make any difference. oh, you are a flaming success now. alan ransome, the successful financier. and i am your nagging wife who doesn't understand. oh, what's the matter, alan? don't get nervous. you think they're going to catch on? they'll be like everyone else. they'll think that we're a happily married couple just made for each... just shut up, just shut up! oh, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir! well... you can stop worrying because when this tub finally gets there... you can relax... because i'm going to leave. that might be a good idea. well, it is. it is a good idea. and then you'll have all your business deals to keep you warm and you won't have any silly woman picking at you. now, won't that be marvelous, huh? yes. yes, it will be. mr. ransome... excuse me. what for this time? oh, millie... oh, mrs. ransome, i didn't see you. we were wondering whether you cared to join us for a cup of tea this afternoon and a chat, perhaps. no, uh, i don't think so. yes, yes, of course, we'd be delighted. it's at 4:00, isn't it? yes, 4:00 at the imperial lounge. all right, we'll see you then. good, good. come along, why did you do that? because you and i have nothing more to say to each other, and you said it yourself, we're gonna be stuck together for a whole week, so we might as well call a truce and make the best of it. okay? okay. ""housey housey."" sounds funsy-wunsy, doesn't it? oh, here they are, millie. come on, mr. and mrs. ransome. tea's ready, the kettle's boiling. come and sit down. thank you. so glad you could make it. it's nice of you to have tea with us. well, it's our pleasure. i don't know if you've really met my wife, have you? millie, mr. and mrs. ransome. hello. hello. i'll have another cup of tea, old girl, if i may. nasty day, i'm afraid. now, then, the reason why we asked you to have apart, of course, from having the pleasure of your company was because... millie- mrs. mckenzie- thought we'd been a little inhospitable, a little standoffish, rude, rude... so, i expect i ought to apologize. do you, mr. mckenzie? i beg your pardon, do i...? apologize? yes, of course, most sincerely. now, another thing- great news, great news. very important, since we've been talking it over millie and old burgess and the rest of us and we've come to the conclusion that you won't have to leave the ship after all. oh, we won't have... oh, say, that is good news. we were afraid we'd have to swim back and that had us sick with worry. oh, my dear fel... he thought he'd got to swim. oh, we'd never allow that. of course we wouldn't. but we were a little bit embarrassed, you know, because it never entered our heads that any stranger- outsider- would want to travel on thelady anne. you see, primarily she's a cruise ship, and last time she picked up a new passenger was, according to captain protheroe... have you met the captain? according to him, the last time they picked up a new passenger was the summer of '48. so, you see... well, no need to fuss, is there? because everything's settled now. what's all settled? what my husband is trying to say is that you won't have to die, after all. twilight zonewill continue after station identification. what did you say? i said you won't have to die after all. of boredom, millie means. don't you, dear? oh! yes, of course. yes. i'm afraid we haven't been very good company so far. well, no. no, frankly... frankly, you haven't. oh, please forgive us. you see, the fact is that old millie and i have spent many fine hours on this old scow. hours one can't forget easily. when we heard they were going we joined her for her last two-way sailing. it's true of the others. that's why there's so many old parties on board. oh. well, we didn't understand. and they still don't understand. some more tea? it's very refreshing. yes, thank you. one thing hasn't changed: it's still the best cup of tea in the world. what about all the others? well, as i said same reason as ourselves, really. sentiment, you know. of course they know. why should they choose thelady anne? blessed if i know. well, it isn't really such a different story. sentiment. there are different kinds of sentiment. partly, it was because alan i haven't really been alone in six years. excuse me. i'm going to get us a drink. good idea. scotch all around? no, not for me, thank you. excuse me. he's embarrassed, isn't he? i'm doing that to him all the time lately. you said that you two hadn't been alone. no, no, uh... alan is a very busy man. anyway, when he told me he was going to england on business, i made him promise to take me, whichever way i decided to go. but why did you choose thelady anne? well, uh, i guess it was time, really. you know, more time to be alone together. i don't know. it just seemed... special. oh, my dear, she is special. much more special than you and your husband could ever imagine. well, for one thing, toby and i sailed on her when we got married. that was, um, 52 years ago. 53, as a matter of fact. oh, you should have seen her then- splendid specimen, she was. the ship i mean, not old... oh, toby, really. i thought you told me it was an old rust bucket. not it, dear. she, she, she. did i say that? i should have been struck by lightning for such a fearful lie. do you know thelady anne was the fairest boat that ever crossed the seas? queen of the fleet, she was. is, old boy. is. no other ship can touch her. i beg your pardon. quite right. oh, this is old ian burgess. you haven't met him properly. mrs. ransome. how do you do? well, don't stand there like a ninny. sit yourself down. please go on. you were telling me how special she is. ""she,"" she said. did you hear? good show. congratulations. she was the only one, mrs. ransome. she specialized... oh, no existedfor honeymooners. her cargo: young people in love. yes. your presence... oh, here he is. come and sit around here. can you manage? mm-hmm. your presence on board is so ironic. no, that's not the word. not ironic. what's the word? sweet. no, that isn't it. doesn't matter. the fact is this ship was a regular floating wedding barge. no one on board except young married couples full of juice, and the moon in their eyes. oh, dear me, you'd have laughed. it was funny to see them pretending they'd been married for years, acting as if they were grown up, and all the time nervous as kittens. remember, burgess? of course i do. but all the nervousness vanished once thelady anne had given them enough time to know each other. she was such a wise lady. she understood these things. everything was done for young people. i expect, to the others, the ship seemed a bit ridiculous. love has its own particular it sees everything larger than life. nothing is too ornate, too fanciful, too dramatic. love demands the theatrical. and then transfigures it. it turns the grotesque into the lovely, as a child does. with it, we can see what we wish to see without it, we can't see anything at all. we can search forever and never find. how a shipping company ever had that particular point of view i cannot imagine. but they turned thelady anne into an enchanted gondola and took that moment of happiness and made it live for two unspeakably wonderful weeks. they get the drift, millie. no need to go all sticky on us. i feel sticky. yes, we all love this ship. when we heard she was going to be retired, we thought it only right to join her on her last journey. most people are here for the same reason. major jones is just behind me- the bald man- with his wife. he was an engineer and a very good one, in his day. and the couple on the left there- the whiteaways- charming couple. they were married on the ship 41 years ago tomorrow. oh. the chap sitting over there alone is otto champion, the writer. surely you've heard about him? we used to call him otto of roses. such a one with the ladies. you wouldn't think so to look at the old chap now, would you? he's a widower. his wife died in '28 uh, no, '29. '29, that's right. the day trigo won the derby. what are you talking about? she died in '33, the year hyperion won the derby. oh, anyway, it was round about that time. good heavens, look. there's old lord bristol. he can hardly walk. is he alone? decent sort of fellow. yes, i'm afraid he is. yes. what about you, mr. burgess? the same. she's lovely. we intended to do this trip together but, uh... oh, no, my dear. please. i'm so sorry. no, i'm sorry. we'll be together again soon. i'm sorry. it's all right, my dear. nothing matters if you're in love. you are in love, aren't you? yes... of course. well, that's all that matters. are you better now, dear? yes, yes, i'm... i'm sorry. it's quite all right. i cry myself sometimes, don't i, toby? sometimes? all the time. oh, no. well, i don't. it depresses me. i say, why don't you two go get some fresh air? it'll do you good. thank you so much. now what's going on? hmm? the, uh, sun. well, what about it? it's, uh... behind us. so... it's behind us. well, it was over there yesterday. that means we're heading north. so we're heading north. we should be heading east. blame it on me. i'm responsible for everything else. why not this? i don't know what i'm doing on this crazy boat. really, eileen, this is ridiculous. eileen? where are you, eileen? eileen? eileen? oh, for pete's sake. oh, i'm sorry. something wrong? have you seen eileen? i can't find her. no. haven't you? no. we were... we were standing over here and, uh, uh, she... she was right behind me, and i... you don't think anything happened to her? i doubt it. it's not easy to fall overboard. she may be looking for you even now. have you seen her? sorry, sir, but i wouldn't worry where's the captain? i want to have this ship searched. captain protheroe is extremely i've already taken the liberty of have you tried the library? eileen! eileen! have you found her? beg pardon, sir? my wife. have you found her? no, sir. not turned up yet? in that case, why not... why not let's go and have a drink, eh? come along, my boy. two whiskeys, please. better make 'em large ones. thank you. now, then... ah! she's gone. no, she hasn't really. it just seems like that. but you've missed her. that's all, my boy. a toast... to thelady anne. the finest and loveliest ship that ever sailed the seas. thelady anne. it's a pity what's going to happen. it isn't a pity. it's a crime! a crime perpetrated by stupid men in bow ties. now, now, easy, burgess. nothing to get overheated about. nothing? are you so... so feebleminded that you can't see the truth? don't you realize why they're going to scrap thelady anne? outlived her usefulness, i suppose. oh, nonsense. she's the finest ship afloat. you deny it? certainly not. oh. she may be a little slow, perhaps, but... 13 or 14 days ought to be quite fast enough for anyone in their right minds. that's just it. people aren't in their right minds anymore. they sacrifice leisure for speed. and speed's the only thing that matters. come, quick, hurry, hurry, hurry. fast, faster, faster. get it over with. why the rush? don't get so querulous, old man. it's bad for you. i am not querulous. i am merely trying to point out the true reason for this disgraceful decision. which is? a plot... obviously of communistic origin. they're going to condemn thelady anne because she represents a way of life. the old way. she has grace, manners, tradition. and now they're going to scrap her. oh, i say! somebody turn him off. nothing is sacred anymore. the beasts are at the gates, but we're too old to fight, so we have to stand around like pathetic statues, with our medals tarnished and our swords broken, while the vandals turn our castles into sideshows and stick up nasty little advertisements for soap all along the roadside. and now they're going to scrap thelady anne. but i warn you, how are we going to stop them from scrapping the whole world? poor old boy. you mustn't blame him. he'd planned to make this trip with his wife. and then, a few weeks ago, she had to go and die on him, poor old boy. well, we'll have the party tomorrow night. yes. he may feel another drink, mr. ransome? no? all right. drinking alone? where have you been? i've been looking all over for you. i've been here, alan. but i look... oh, alan. alan, you must be drunk. no. i'm not drunk. where did this come from? mrs. mckenzie gave it to me. she wore it on her honeymoon. do you like it? it's beautiful. and you're beautiful. oh, alan alan, what happened? i don't know what happened. but i'm going to try very hard not to forget it. see that? what have you got there, dear? don't you remember? they're your letters. i've had them how long a time? what are you going to do with them, eh? bury them. i don't need them anymore. it won't be very long now. here they are. come along, mr. and mrs. ransome. champagne's getting warm. you know my wife, don't you? that's the captain. have you met captain protheroe? no. there he is, mr. and mrs. ransome. sit down. make yourselves comfortable. i'm very happy to meet you. we're happy to meet you, sir. you've had a pleasant voyage? oh, yes, sir. we're... we're grateful to have been part of it. indeed? well, that's very nice. i suppose you've packed your things? hmm? they don't know yet. oh? well... i suppose it's all the same. don't know what, sir? oh, nothing. we thought it would be better this way, captain. you know, your presence aboard has been rather- how shall i say? - symbolic. us ending, as it were, and you beginning. our captain's quite a romantic, isn't he? extraordinary man. well, if you'll excuse me, i have some business to attend to. you'll be back? very shortly. yes. well, look at me. that's cute. i see thelady anne has worked her magic on you. oh, yes. she andyou- all of you. i can't tell you how grateful we are. see, we'd forgotten so many things. as mr. burgess said, people don't know how to relax. rush, rush, rush. i guess i was rushing. i forgot the most important things in my life. but i won't lose sight of them again. i say, let's drink to that, shall we? yes, here we are. cheers. thank you. what's that? what's what? the engines. they've stopped. some slight difficulty. nothing, nothing, nothing. mrs. ransome, may i have the pleasure of this dance? oh, i was hoping you'd ask me. thank you. mrs. mckenzie i'm not very good, but, uh... delighted, mr. ransome. good old millie. got your hands full. not so much of the ""old,"" dear. had enough of it, did you? thank you. i see they haven't got them fixed. what fixed? the engines. oh? no. your things have been gathered together. what things? why, your luggage. really, mckenzie, i'd have thought you'd have told them by now. yes... well, we're all having such a fine time i didn't want to spoil the fun. excuse me, but what are you talking about? why should we gather our things together? because, my friends, we're putting you off the ship. you're what? putting you off the ship. what do you mean? just that. why? are we in trouble? no, no... well, then why? there's no time for explanations. if mr. mckenzie had done as he promised, they wouldn't even be necessary. skip the explanation. they'll understand eventually. maybe, but we're not going anywhere until we understand why. i'm afraid you haven't any choice. follow me, please. no. unless this is some sort of gag. oh, it is, isn't it? i mean, you don't just put passengers off a ship in mid-ocean. he's kidding, isn't he? follow the captain, please. we'll come along with you. a bit of the way, anyhow. better bring your coat, millie. my boy, mustn't worry too much. your exact position's been radioed. even now, help's on the way. your luggage is in the boat, you see. biscuits, flares... and some champagne, i saw to that. coats and provisions are in the boat. oh, and it sends out an automatic signal. really... everything you need. except a reason. i'm sorry. it's time we were off. into the boat, please. but why? is it something we've done? no, not a bit of it. then for heaven's sake, why? tell us. you can't just put someone off a ship in the middle of the ocean without a reason. there's a reason, my boy. we like you people. we thought you liked us. they do. lower away! better put on those coats. you'll get cold. wrap up warm. yes, wrap up warm. good-bye! bye-bye! stiff upper lip! keep it up! cheers! cold? i've never felt so warm in my whole life. thelady anne never reached port. after they were picked up by a cutter a few hours later, as captain protheroe had promised, the ransomes searched the newspapers for news, but there wasn't any news. thelady anne, with all her crew and all her passengers, vanished without a trace. but the ransomes knew what had happened. they knew that the ship had sailed off to a better port- a place called the twilight zone."

[chuckles] yes. let me introduce you to chief inspector nelson in charge of security. monsieur arnaud from paris. monsieur. monsieur. yes, good. and of course, we have our own security arriving tomorrow with the painting. hm. well, i'm sure you'll all get along perfectly splendidly. now, the painting will hang here. and the chief inspector will explain the security precautions that we've taken. well, we've tried to keep it simple and unobtrusive as possible, monsieur. after all, it is a painting and not the crown jewels. exactement, monsieur. and to a frenchman, it is worth more than the crown jewels. yes. to a frenchman, it would be, yes. yes, well, carry on, chief inspector. from tomorrow, two of my plain clothes officers will be on permanent guard either side here doing exhibition hours. arnaud: and? chief inspector nelson: of course. and in addition to the private security guards, i shall have two other officers mingling around the crowd and keeping their eyes open for anything that might be suspicious in the exhibition. and during all times that the exhibition is closed to the public, this gate will dropped off from a ceiling like this-- [machine whirring] it will lock into the floor, thereby securely shutting the painting off from the rest of the room. what's all the fuss about? do you know, dear? do you know? it's ""the patrician lady,"" madam. ""the patrician lady?"" coming here? did you hear that? arnaud: [speaking french] [ominous music playing] what's behind there? oh, behind there. it's, um, a storeroom full of inferior paintings. it just locked? parnell: of course, of course. now, i shall make a check last thing tonight. and then from tomorrow, the inspector and his team will be in charge of all aspects of security. [humming] bernice: [humming] [music playing] parnell: well, if you'll excuse me, andre, i have an appointment at harbour city. i wasn't expecting you till tomorrow, you know? well, david, you know i must check everything for myself. call it my little weakness, if you wish. oh, on the contrary, it's your strength. chief inspector nelson: i'll just have a last look around and then see you tomorrow. [city traffic] bernice: and a bottle of white spirit and a palette knife, please. mm-hm. there you are. [chuckles] people usually spend ages choosing a palette knife. i can always tell at a glance. how much does all that come to? um, 49 pounds 62, please. check ok? yes, fine. - to zarchetti's art supplies? - limited. limited. thank you. thank you. there you are. [chuckles] you, uh, look as if you mean business. i'm going to paint a masterpiece. attendant: [chuckles] well, good luck. [music playing] art dealer: well, gentlemen, you've each had it to study for five days. now i want your verdict. well, naturally, for the first opinion, i defer to the established choro authority, mr. jameson. pulver: you mean, what he says would influence you. that's not what i'm paying you for kendall. not at all. my mind is utterly made up, utterly. pulver: then let's hear it. yes, do let's. what does mr. parnell think? pulver: he'll get his turn. very well. i regret to have to say this mr. pulver, but there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that you've been sold a pup. - a what? louis kendall: your choro is a forgery. walter jameson: [laughs] pulver: jameson. louis kendall: well, as it happens, it's obvious. come on, jameson. may i ask, without prejudice, where you purchased this painting? at the collingwood auction. what's that got to do with it? well, i didn't know that. you didn't tell me. so now, i can tell you that in 25 years of the collingwood annual auctions, there's never once been a question mark raised against one of his sales. collingwood is a man of the utmost integrity. that's my first point. my second, speaking as my friend here so kindly put it, as the foremost expert on choro in this country is that we are in the presence of an original choro. louis kendall: rubbish. any halfwit can see that that canvas is a pathetic attempt to imitate the choro style. walter jameson: what do you know about choro style, kendall? i've written a book about it. the hell with the style. is it authentic? parnell? parnell: well, i can't claim the impressive credentials of my two colleagues. but i know that i like what i see. that's an authentic choro. and i congratulate you on your good luck. luck? that cost me 30,000 pounds. and good judgement. well, gentlemen, i asked for your vote. i could only wish it had been unanimous. thank you for your valuable time. you stay. i hope you found it was worth it. creeps. now, don't try and tell me that that guy jameson isn't on collingwood's payroll. as for that crazy clod kendall, he couldn't tell a cantilever from a can of beans. well, then why did you call us in, mr. pulver? i'll tell you why. i'm sitting in my dentist, aren't i? i pick up a magazine, and there's this article about art forgeries, how smart they're getting at aging, canvases, and paints. so i get jumpy. now that, that means a lot to me. it means a lot more than most people do. but it's got to be the real mccoy. can you understand what i mean? tell me honestly, parnell, do you experts really know what you're doing when you look over a painting? oh, yes. pulver: sure? quite sure. [chuckles] ok. ok. i, uh, i read ""the patrician lady"" is being brought over for exhibition at your gallery. that's quite a coup. and quite a responsibility. doesn't it make you nervous? no. i have experts who look after the security side of things. so why should i be nervous? impossible to steal, huh? i'd it would take an exceptionally clever thief. hm. what wouldn't i give for just 24 hours along with that lady. ah, yes. well, i, uh, can offer you an invitation to our opening tomorrow night, if that's any consolation. [music playing] bernice: just stay right where you are, mr. parnell. what the hell are you doing here? your night porter was fast asleep. i just walked right in. oh, silly old man. i'll fire him. just as well with the noise you were making. how's it going? yeah, the last one is in place. did you get the stamp? bernice: here. parnell: ah, good girl. here, hold this for me, will you? bernice: what happened to our lunch date? oh, arnaud turned up a day early. i had to introduce him to the policemen. sorry about that. oh, i saw you actually when the policeman was trying out the gate. [thumping] i also had a peek into the storeroom. parnell: oh, yeah? bernice: are you sure this is going to work out all right? parnell: yes, quite sure. bernice: i'm nervous. it all seems much too simple or too risky. and i'm not sure which. parnell: that's the fun of it. sweet little buttons and eight big bangs, and it's all over. but why at the opening with so many people here? parnell: because we want as much publicity as we can get. can't you understand? do your homework, and i'll see you in an hour. all right? yeah. [smack] [music playing] bernice: (sighs heavily) ah! hm. [smack] it's good. it's good. oh, it was nothing really. i found another customer today. amos pulver? yes. rich, ruthless, and lonely. needs a lady to share his life with. what did you decide about his choro? his choro? it's genuine. toss a coin, did you? [sighs] oh! i can't do any more tonight. i've been living with her for weeks, and she getting to be a bore. a bore? the internal, mysterious woman with the enigmatic smile? enigmatic, my foot. she had bad teeth. they all did in those days-- unlike your modern beauties. ah, you're are a genius-- and a delight. and you make me very contented. geniuses don't go for contentment. they go for-- hm, hm, that too. just think, if i'd have painted that in those days and been a man, i'd be immortal. hm, well, i prefer you mortal. [smooching] and useful. [music playing] [crowd gasping] [non-english speech] [hushed whispering] parnell: [clears throat] uh, yes. ah, huh. is it-- is it me, andre, or-- or is it just a tiny bit crooked? arnaud: yes, yes, i think perhaps you're right, yeah. - would you mind if i, um-- - no, no. please, go ahead. good idea. yes. thank you. ah, i think just a tiny bit on the-- yeah. parnell: --corner here, like-- arnaud: yeah. parnell: --that. there. [chuckles] yes? arnaud: exactly. uh, ladies and gentlemen, the exhibition opens officially tomorrow morning. so if you'll be kind enough to leave the gallery now. thank you. uh, andre? - mm-hm. would you care for a spot of lunch? what did you have in mind? oh, i thought langan's, just around the corner on stratton street. do you remember that? [machine whirring] [city traffic] you were absolutely right. i was much too hasty. can we try again. attendant: oh, heavens, yes, of course. no problem. excuse me. [crowd chatter] walter jameson: ah, parnell. you know mr. collingwood, don't you? mr. collingwood, how delightful to see you. glad you could come. oh, i wouldn't have missed this for the world, mr. parnell. i say, parnell, must we have that sheet of glass over it? it'll pick up reflections. i can't see it. parnell: well, it's the french security afraid, louis. there's nothing i can do about it. i find customers rarely complain in the presence of great works, so long as they believe that they are getting their money's worth. it's a matter of the emperor's clothes. well. [laughs] oh, by the way, thank you for that little service you did me the other day. i would have hated to have been forced to return pulver's money. parnell: yes, well, it was a close run thing, i'm afraid-- two against one. fortunately, my vote carried the day. what-- oh, waiter, take this, would you? what was your actual opinion? oddly enough, the one i gave. oh, good. i thought so too. i would have staked my reputation on it. hm. how fortunate that you didn't have to take that risk. [chuckles] excuse me, won't you? [clears throat] uh, ah, oh, i'm so sorry. excuse me. thank you. on um, an-- andre, andre. minister, would you step this way please. thank you so much. thank you. that's right. minister, if you'd stand there. very good. ah, ladies and gentlemen, minister, it is with considerable sense of humility that i stand before you today in the presence of this great lady, who has honored my gallery with her first appearance on these shores. i'm sure you all want to step a little closer and gaze at her unchallenged beauty. but before you do, i should like to introduce my friend and colleague from paris, monsieur andre arnaud, the curator or mr. rosenberg's wonderful collection. but for whose triumph in persuading the owner to share his greatest treasure with other nations, we should not be gathered here tonight. monsieur andre arnaud. [applause] arnaud: madams and monsieurs, i mean, ladies and gentlemen, i shall speak briefly before handing you over to the minister for the arts to open this exhibition. please, excuse my bad english. it is a great honor for me to be here tonight. my country, as you know, has many, many art treasures, perhaps the finest in the world. this point might be disputed. but i think no one tonight will dispute that behind my back now hangs one of the true wonders of the world. [music playing] i refer, of course, to ""the patrician,"" ""the patrician lady."" [applause] the internal mysterious female with the enigmatic smile. it is with great pride that i share her with the british public. and as i'm sure you are very impatient to make your acquaintance, i now invite the minister of the arts to declare this exhibition open. minister. [applause] [explosions] [crowd gasping] [machine whirring] [explosions] [dramatic music playing] [explosions] [explosion] arnaud: where's my paintings? what's happening? what's happening? [coughs] oh, no. ""the patrician"" [french] [french] parnell: it's all there, thank god, unharmed, i think, too. arnaud: oh, no. let me see. let me see. quick, quick. [french] [speaking french] i think i worked it out, mr. parnell. yeah, the thief somehow got into that storeroom. and he planned to slip his hole-- [grunts] and then in the confusion take the painting and make his getaway through this window, which as you can see is still wide open. well, what do you suppose went wrong? well, it's obvious he either lost his nerve or-- or he was driven back by this smoke, which he hadn't expected to be so powerful and went off down the alley, luckily for us. your security men must have been asleep on the job! she's intact. i think she is intact. yes. yes? [coughs] god! what? what have you seen? parnell: what's that? what? oh, turn the picture over. turn it, turn it all over. parnell: there, zarchetti's art supplies limited. i-- i don't understand. what is it? are you sure you shipped the original to this country, monsieur? of course we did, you fool. just a minute. suppose they switched the painting. switched? chief inspector nelson: in the confusion. yeah, i've heard these art forgers are real masters nowadays. even art experts can't tell the difference. yes, i suppose they made the switch. but like all crooks, they slipped up on one detail. switch? chief inspector nelson: they missed seeing zarchetti's stamp when they put that together. help. arnaud: [french] chief inspector nelson: they bought the canvas at zarchetti's. and they painted on it. ha, that's ridiculous. this is the original. i'd stake my reputation on it. monsieur arnaud will know. he's been living with the picture for years. he could tell if it was a fake, couldn't you andre? yes, uh, i don't remember this dent on the frame. oh. well, uh, ah, that could have been the explosion, couldn't it? lead me to a telephone, david. parnell: yes. mind your head. in my office here. [music playing] arnaud: [speaking french] the x-rays, my assistant is looking for them. and he will send them directly to london. good. a clever forger may possibly nowadays delude us, but he cannot fool the x-rays. he cannot duplicate every nuance of paint-- its thickness and thinness in such expert. and he cannot possibly duplicate the microscopic individuality of every thread of the original canvas. parnell: uh, you mean we'll x-ray the canvas we got here and compare the results with those in your file? that's right, sir. just wait for it. come on. [speaking french] uh, my assistant has-- he's read the x-rays. but have no fear, i have given orders, they will be found. when did you steal the x-rays? parnell: oh, a couple of months ago when i was in paris negotiating the deal. i saw them in a draw in arnaud's office. actually, that's what gave me the idea. oh, bother! hm, you having trouble? it's indelible. well, soon come off with a dollop of sunshine. when are we leaving? not for a few weeks yet, time for the experts to pass judgment on the lady and for our man to go into action. art dealer: so it really was stolen, huh? [chuckles] [chuckles] i-- i know nothing about the theft, monsieur. [chuckles] the painting merely fell into my hands. [laughter] just think, millions will file past the copy, and all the time, amos p. pulver has the original. art dealer: you realize, of course, [grunts] monsieur that you can never show the painting to anyone. if you-- the authorities ever discover that you have the original, they would surely take it away from you. [chuckles] they might even put you in prison, hm? [laughter] you must insist that, uh, you-- you bought it as a copy. and i shall deny ever having met you. don't worry. nobody will ever see it except me. not even your wife, monsieur? [music playing] not even your wives, monsieur? art buyer: [non-english speech] i, hermit schmemacher, have the original. oh, i'm indeed fortunate! indeed, monsieur, indeed you are. [chuckles] [dramatic music playing] [gasps] ah! ah! ah! ah! [sighs heavily] that's it, no more! i'm finished. (yelling) i'm all painted out! i-- i know. it-- it's been terrible. i'm sorry, but (stammering) it-- it-- it's over now, finished, finished. it's finished. wouldn't it have been simpler to steal it? well, uh, and have the police of five continents looking for us? no, no. it's-- it's much safer this way to create the illusion of theft and cash in on the [chuckles] cupidity of unscrupulous men. hm? [music playing] and your very considerable talents. bernice? hm? how do you feel about [inaudible]?? [theme music]"

fry, where's leela? we haven'! seen her since she sprouted tentacles. what'? she didn't move down there? then where is she? that's what! called to ask you. well, you didn't! i've got to figure out where leela went. i just need some kind of clue. ow! leela's boot. where did it come from? i think it fell from the sky, but i'm not sure. now i'm sure. whoa! remember that mural on my cousin's van? it's like it came to life! i keep telling you, we didn't grow up together. help, help! oh! leela, don't worry, we're here to rescue you! how do we get up there?

look, leela, there's nothing about your body that could ever shock me, so... that is nasty! sorry i screamed, leela. i was just so excited to see you. yeah. let's just get out of here. no problem. i'll bend the door open. you can't bend a wooden door! i know that, and you know that. but this door looks pretty stupid. what time is it? time for you to shut up! quick, in here! we'll be safe in this utter darkness. hey, maybe one of these switches turns off that scary noise. fee-fi-fo-fum! you had me at ""fee""! it's another one of mom's genetic monstrosities! poor thing. we've got to help him. i thought we were in a hurry to escape, but whatever. it's okay, big guy. we won't let her hurt you anymore. well, look what the giant cat dragged in. memo to self, breed giant cat to drag things in. you're not breeding any giant thing! it's reckless and irresponsible, and we're going to stop you. yeah! even if it means crashing this ship with us in it. yeah! wait. crashing what with who in it? don't worry, mother, we'll save... mmm, mmm, mmm! mama knows what i like! huh? the sky is falling! i say, i say, the sky is falling! and remember, don't report them missing till after we max out their credit cards. squid attack! hit the deck! we're back, baby. and we brought you a little something. it's okay. leela's just changed a little. more than a little. she's beautiful! listen, fry, whatever it was that you and i had together... goulash?

i would never help you commit your perverted crimes against nature! my marigolds! thanks to that dna sample you generously donated while locked in my tower, my beanstalks now have suction cups to keep them from collapsing. that's horrible! is it? now the world's starving masses have a cheap, abundant source of nutrition. but not too cheap. i'll take the cash, and you can have the credit. i don't want the credit! genetic engineering is wrong! oh, really? tell that to your old friend, the giant. where is he? oh, god, he's invisible now! fee-fi, hi. i'm stan. aha! you see? i freed him from your infernal contraption and he returned to normal. on the contrary, i suffer from hereditary gigantism. or i did, until morn cured me of my awful disease using genetic engineering. that's why she had me hooked up in her lab. oh! well, congratulations. you look great. but even if genetic engineering feeds the hungry and cures some giant guy, that doesn't make it right. we have no idea what the long-term effects will be. and once that genie is out of the bottle... i can cure you, too. okay, i'm in."
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"""i paint what i see"" is a painter's maxim, and one that reveals to us the many layers of our world. because behind everything beautiful lies the dark. beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but what about the horror? we ascribe these visions to a feverish imagination. a whim, a folly. but what if they are not? what if they are a careful record, a warning, or a family album? our tale tonight is ""pickman's model,"" and its director, keith thomas. how much longer must i keep my neck like this? you can't rush perfection. and you wouldn't wanna end up with one hill bigger than the other. you wouldn't dare. thought you gave the girl the morning off. rebecca? don't you dare. mmm... rebecca, where are you? up here, papa! mm-hmm. thurber, thurber. thank god. save me from these philistines. oh, come now. we were just discussing the impressionists. smithfield here was busy railing against cézanne. all i said is i don't see what the fuss is about. my father saw his exhibition in paris two summers ago. he said it was rotten. do you see what i'm dealing with? rotten?! places, gentlemen. you are on my time now. before we begin, i have some announcements. the deadline for this year's student art prize approaches. for those of you unaware of its importance, the work judged to be the best by the committee will be put on display at arkham gallery to be seen by critics and patrons alike. this kind of opportunity can be the making of a young artist, as i am sure last year's winner can attest. mr. thurber? quite, sir. also, starting today, we have a new addition to our class. mr. pickman, if you'll find an empty space. if you are all ready. our 15 minutes begins... now. draw what you see. be aware of the empty space near the bicep. remember your basic shapes. construct, don't shade. remember, the neck is a limb. four minutes remaining. my time, mr. thurber. or have we finished already? i just fail to see what's so interesting about them. that's because you lack imagination. it's why thurber here keeps taking your money at cards. full house. i'd say you fellas could use a little of the new kid's imagination. new kid? pickman? that guy's got to be at least 80 years old. and from what i hear, he's a wet fish. old new england money. - not that you'd be able to tell. - i heard his mother's from arkham. mm! a friend has it that she died of a grizzly suicide when he was a boy. his father went mad shortly after. thanks to his inheritance, he's been rambling around europe for the past decade. well! if his piece today was any indication, he won't make it at miskatonic. i mean, the entire point of the class is to draw what you see, not rotting flesh. - perhaps that is what he saw. - the man does draw in the cemetery. early in the evening to be grave-robbing. it's pickman, right? richard. well, dickie... what do you have there? i think the rats got to her. well, something certainly did. eugh. so do you do this kind of thing a lot? haunt cemeteries in the dead of night? 'cause your imagination is... i saw the piece you did in bosworth's class. you're very good. well, i'm not sure he'd agree. if there's one thing bosworth can't abide in his students, it's talent. he seems to like your work. you thinking about entering the art prize? you, uh... you really should. it's, uh... quite the opportunity. oh, i'm not very interested in prizes. then what are you interested in, dickie? these are... powerful. the darkness, the ugliness, the corruption. suffering is living. we cannot let sympathy or altruism shield us from finding the truths of this world. oh, come on now. don't keep it a secret. where does one find these, uh, elusive truths? where fear lives. ah, i see you're tardy as usual. what, you're not submitting? i decided to give the rest of you guys a chance to impress. - so how goes it? - oh, brutally of course. smithfield is proclaiming he has it in the bag. any sign of pickman? he's in with them now. dickie? it's the wrong audience for my work. sorry. i'm beginning to doubt these people truly have anything to teach. we have a... well, sort of a ritual, me and some of the others, after a brutal critique. a little... fun. - would you... - you should join us. ...like to see my paintings? i would. you, uh... you never showed these. yeah. come. this work's a little stronger than what you've seen. my family have been in new england for generations, since before the witch trials. my mother told me stories as a boy. family stories. my great-grandmother's great-grandmother, lavinia. she was branded a hex. a sorceress. burned at the stake. the family gossip claims lavinia killed her husband during a rite, then served his still-warm flesh to members of her coven. sometimes, when i'd wake in the night... ...i'd hear them through the floor. sounds of their party. do you hear that? do you hear them, will? - i... - beneath us, in the earth, my kin... tough night, will? you do realize it's afternoon? oh, shit. oh, sh... shit! excuse me. so lovely to see you! - the party's almost over. - i know. i'm... i'm sorry. i'm here now. - everything okay? - of course. why? whiskey. whatever you got. what? i'm just getting into the swing of it. come. we've been waiting. will, this is my aunt, mrs. creighton. aunt lizzy, this is my friend william thurber. my dear niece rebecca swears you're quite the artist. would you excuse me for a moment? i'm just gonna go find papa. of course. she's a remarkable young woman. so, william, tell me about your art. rebecca says you specialize in portraits, which i happen to adore. i've sat for many a portrait in my... oh. are you all right? excuse me. - will. - ah! uh... i'm sor... uh... i'd... i'd like you to meet my father charles. - hello, william. - pleasure to meet you, sir. ah! excuse me, sir. - steady on! - are you all right? will? will! will, stop! - what is wrong? - i just... i... - what? - that... that woman. the woman with... with... with your father, she... no, see, she's not... how di... what is happening to me? last night, the... the painting... i'm s... i'm sorry. i'm... i'm... i'm so sorry. are you? i mean, you knew how important this was to me. - you show up drunk. - i'm not... that's my father! that's my father! i know. you should go. please. please, please don't. this was such a mistake. i don't even recognize you anymore. dickie. dickie! joe, it undermines the very traditions of european craftsmanship. if you ask me, i think people are rather tired of that crazy stuff. what people is that? you can't just decry the entire modernist movement as worthless. samuel's work, perhaps. tell me, what does our resident tastemaker think? i think the two of you enjoy your arguments even more than your art. and... you're both right. tradition is important. it endures. but what is art in this modern world without truth? a little risk? who's this? uh... clown! what's his name? he doesn't have a name. i think we need to give them some names. i think they deserve that. - what should we call him? - i don't know. and this one, who's this? he's mr. green mouth. mr. green mouth? - why is he mr. green mouth? - that's why drew him with a green mouth. someone's up awfully late this evening. papa! hi. - he wanted to show you his pictures. - did he? i like this. very interesting use of color. tell you what, i will take all these to my office so i can see them every day. - right? - all right. mm-hmm. time for bed. go brush your teeth. papa will tuck you in. good boy. are you tired? exhausted. how exhausted? don't worry. i'll be quick. ow! excuse me. hello? hey! mm? will? will? - what's the matter? - nothing. nothing, sorry. i was just... i couldn't sleep. - you want some tea? - sure. sure, thank you. sweetheart, you didn't meet whoever sent this, did you? the man said you know him. said his name is pickman. he's back in town again. mr. thurber. you're in early. this is to be returned to the artist along with the check. - i'd like it gone today. - of course. is there an address? just get it done! please. thurber, my boy, you look tired. my, uh... my son, he, uh... he isn't sleeping much. ah, yes. children. who are we waiting on? apologies. yes, yes, let's begin, shall we? i call the committee to order. now, we have a few items to get through today, but first, joe, you look positively like the cat that ate the canary. would you care to enlighten us? i've invited a special guest to join us. i'd like the group to consider his work for this year's exhibition. well, now i'm curious. gentlemen, this is richard upton pickman. richard and i were at miskatonic together. you remember william thurber, of course. ah, of course. well, richard was a startling talent, even then, and unlike the rest of us, only seems to have gotten better with age. now, i'm aware it's out of the ordinary, but i've asked for him to bring along a few paintings. if my fellow committee members will indulge me, i'll ask for you to head through to the gallery for a viewing. i trust you'll find it worth your while. i suppose we can play along. - dr. reid, i don't think this... - you'll get your turn. joe. joe! this is not a good idea. aw, are you afraid of a little competition, thurber? i know pickman. i know his work. you can't show it at an exhibition. huh. funny. i never thought of you as a bad sport. ...suffering from the most terrible... will? where have you been? there are some things i wanna talk to you about, but i have a monstrous headache, so... we have a guest. i hope you don't mind my dropping in. it's my business... to catch the undertones of the soul. you won't find those on artificial streets, on man-made lands. if there are any ghosts round here, they're the tame ghosts of a salt marsh and a shallow cove. my art... well... my art... ...is about the ancient. fascinating. during university, will and i and the miskatonic boys, we had a little spiritualism phase. we liked to hold séances. we liked to call up the dead. we were just playing games, but... it was very thrilling. it felt dangerous. i truly doubt that dickie wants to hear these childish stories. there was one night when it wasn't a game. it got very quiet. and dark. i... couldn't see anything anymore. i felt like... i felt like i was... like i was blind. and the others, i mean... i never told the others anything, but... i felt like... i felt like i was floating. and then i have this... this funny feeling in my head. it's like a... sort of a... buzzing? yes. it was a thing. all those years ago. tell me, richard, you must be so excited to debut the exhibition. more than your lovely husband, i fear. i worry he's grown more sensitive with age. well, that's a word for it. well, on that note, why don't we call it a night? it's time for james to be put to bed. come to my house. see the work. perhaps you should invite minot. minot would never understand! just think on it. please. do thank your wife for dinner. and tell james i enjoyed our chat. he's a special boy. reminds me a little of myself. you were rude tonight. i was embarrassed. you were embarrassed? you were fawning over him like a schoolgirl. richard is the only friend of yours who's succeeded as an artist, and... the way you treat him... people are talking, will. at the gallery, at the committee. you are acting strange, and it's not just with me. you're coming home late. you... you're barely home anymore, and when you are home... it's like... it's like a... i feel like... i feel like you're disappearing from me. i need to know if you're drinking again. i... i have always tried to look for the... the joy and the beauty in everything. but around this man and his work, i just... the darkness has a way of... catching me. life can't always be beautiful. ah! yog... no, no... come... ng'ngah. yog-sothoth. y'ai'ng'ngah. ah, ahh! ah! no! ahh! ng-ahh! ah! no! no! no! their mouths... their mouths... sh, sh, sh, sh. hey, buddy. you okay? will. this is a surprise. what did you say to my son? answer me. is he unwell? he woke screaming in terror. i'm only gonna say this once. you stay away from my family. i thought we were friends. friends? as far as i'm concerned, the balance of our friendship is paid. i'm sorry you feel that way, but it was never about the money. i value your judgment. i always have. please, will, you've come all this way. i know you want to see my new paintings. the finest i done. i need you to see 'em. no. no, dickie. and if... if i was to agree to stay away from your family? and also to offer to pull out of the exhibition, to destroy my paintings, should you still think them unsuitable, and stay out of your life forever? you would do that? if you come to my house now. it must be shocking to see the state of things here. but, uh... my work, will, it is paramount. electricity went out several months back. this way. welcome to my work. do you feel it, will? the fear. cursed rats. the hill's infested with them. deus knows what they eat. they must've run short. one moment. back. whoa! no! he's my friend. no, get down! back. dickie? ng'ngah. yog-sothoth. - will. - somebody has to stop you, dickie! if i'm the one, i have to stop you! your paintings infect my mind. it's only art. no. no! no, see, see, i thought that it was me. that i was... i was drunk or... or delirious, shell-shocked and... and... and broken, but it was these, these paintings. this whole time it was the paintings! what... what you make, it... it... crawls behind the eyes, and it... it ma... it makes you crazy. dickie, dickie, it causes madness, and i... it's the world that's mad, will. that's what breeds fear. knowing what lurks in the darkness. - stop it, stop it, stop it. - knowing where fear... - stop it, stop it! - ...lives. here. - let me show you. - stop it, stop it, stop it. make it stop please! stop, dickie! dickie, you stop it! what are you doing?! dickie, i swear to god! paint what you see, what is familiar to you. these entities are real. close to me. family portraits. the paintings don't come from my head. they come from my life. now it's time for you to meet them. time to see what awaits us all... in the darkness. dickie. dickie, i'm... dear god. it's all in your mind. it's extraordinary, will. reid did much of the heavy lifting before i stepped in. go, explore. i want you to be the first to see it. - come on. - that's my good boy. you seen joe? he was supposed to be here this morning. uh, mr. minot came in last night, uh, saying he had some final adjustments to make. i think he's still here. you're sure? yes. joe? joe? i watched that painting burn, joe. how d... y'ai'ng'ngah. sothoth. - joe. - y'ai'ng'ngah... joe. s'ai... joe. it's me. what have you done, joe? he is coming from the other side. it's okay. it's okay. i'm g... i'm gonna... he is coming for the feast. he is coming from the darkness to show us all the beauty... - gabriel! - ...of fear! gabriel! hey, you all right? why don't you go see gabriel? - are you all right? - yes. - you sure? - of course i'm fine. what... there's been an accident. it's... it's joe. - an accident? - i need you to take james home right now. - what kind of... - now, rebecca. - joe's hurt. - what? i'm gonna go get him help. i want you to take all of pickman's works out immediately. do you understand? - take them? where? what's happening? - just get them out of here. destroy them. and, gabriel... do not look at them. you burn them! joe, look away! it smells delicious. i, uh... i want to apologize to you, my love, for how i've been. i want you to know that it's... it's all over now. everything is gonna be... it's gonna be better. i'm... i'm going to be better. i promise you. it's all over. it's... it's over. i know where it lives, will. what? where what lives, sweetheart? i know where fear lives. no. no. please, please, please, god! no, no, not... not you! i'm sorry, i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i'm so sorry. please. please. i... i... i tried. i did try. sh. you'll spoil the meal. where is james?

sensors detected a temporal distortion almost in our course. there's a small object that wasn't there before. it's 50 kilometres ahead, sir. - full stop. - aye, sir. on screen. dimensions, worf? approximately five metres long, sir. life signs? no signs of any kind. our sensors do not penetrate the hull. try hailing it. - that's odd. - what's odd? we've received a response, but... yes, mr worf? they want you to move over, sir. reply that the enterprise isn't going anywhere. not the enterprise, captain. you. what are you trying to tell me? excuse me, but you were standing right where i needed to be. who are you? rasmussen's the name, sir. professor berlinghoff rasmussen. this is wonderful! actually, quite a bit larger than i thought. really? where i come from, every historian knows the bridge of old 1701-d! where exactly do you come from? why, earth. late 26th-century earth, to be exact. i've travelled back nearly 300 years just to find you. space, the final frontier. these are the voyages of the starship enterprise. its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. exactly what kind of historian are you? my focus is on the 22nd through the 24th centuries. early interstellar history. it was always believed this was on your desk, not here. fascinating! don't move it on my account! you can't expect me to believe that the layout of my ready room can be of interest to future historians. no less so than your legendary modesty, captain. if i could describe to you what a thrill it is to be here! this is the original. you flatter me, professor. but i can't help but wonder what could possibly have caused you to select me as a subject for study. even in this decade, there are far wiser humans in and out of starfleet. i'd love to tell you, i would. but imagine what a young caesar might have done differently had someone given him a hint of what lay ahead, or if lincoln had been coerced into changing his theatre plans! i wish i could be more specific on why you were selected, but i'm afraid the exchange of information will have to flow in one direction only. five, six, seven metres. i was right. - why now? - right. if you've come to study us and the captain, why today? why not a year ago or a year from now? i picked the right day. just wait. you'll see. do you always sit there, on that side of the table? usually. why? it's not important. at what point does time travel become a tool for historians? now, now, commander, you know better than that. i've studied a great deal about your century. you are all aware of the dangers of altering the past. that's what i'd be doing if it were to divulge information like that. - telurian plague. - i beg your pardon? the telurian plague, was it cured? did they find the cure by your century? surely i can ask that. it's difficult, but we must keep to ourselves questions about the future. go on, professor. i'll prepare questionnaires. complete them when you can. if you're concerned about a breach of security, i'm sure your captain can make a determination. and thank you in advance for curbing your curiosity. if i hand it in on time, can i get a glimpse of next week's poker game? mr data, escort the professor to his quarters. this way, sir. what did he mean, he picked the right day? - you know everything i do. - deanna? it's hard to tell, but he is holding something back. of course he is. all the things he could tell us. it might be that. i don't know. what if he's an impostor? we've seen enough of them. he is human. medical scans prove that. he's human, alright. there was a temporal distortion, mr worf? yes, sir. no one can deny that his ship is unlike anything we've ever seen. the hull is made of a plasticised tritanium mesh. we've nothing like it on record. mr worf, i do appreciate your caution. i share it. bring his vessel into the shuttlebay. place it under guard. yes, sir. i realise that this visit is going to be difficult for some of us, but his credentials seem to be in order, so we should extend to him every courtesy. including questionnaires? including questionnaires, mr worf. this is really a thrill, like running across a redstone missile or a gutenberg bible. to think, the model t of androids. if you mean the first production-model automobile of the 20th century, the model a would be a more apt analogy, since i am dr soong's revised prototype. i stand corrected. is there a problem? i suppose it'll have to do, for now. i'll get you a list of the things i'll be needing, ok? would i be correct in assuming that you know whether or not i am still alive in the 26th century? since you seem to know so much about the ship, i assumed... it'd be best if you kept your assumptions to yourself, wouldn't it? yes, sir. sorry, sir. captain's log, stardate 45350.3. we have arrived at penthara iv and can see for ourselves the atmospheric devastation caused by the asteroid's impact. we've located underground pockets of carbon dioxide here, here and here. our drilling phasers can release enough of the gas to form an envelope to temporarily hold in the heat of the sun. we've spent years trying to avoid anything that would lead to a greenhouse effect, and now we're about to create one on purpose! less than 20 percent of normal sunlight is getting through. if we can hold enough heat in, that should give the planet time to mend. - excuse me, dr moseley? - what now? new seattle reports a cloud depth of 12 kilometres. two tropical rivers are freezing. let's start, before there's nothing left to mend. look who's here. i hate questionnaires. professor! come and join us. hope i'm not intruding. not at all. you're the topic of conversation at every table here. as i promised, here are your assignments. i'm sure they're painless. please try and complete them by tomorrow. - tomorrow? - no problem, professor. - you're all very calm. - any reason we shouldn't be? history always records what people were doing when important events took place. but it rarely remembers their activities a week before, a day or even an hour. are you suggesting an important event is imminent? i didn't say that. go on doing what you're doing and pretend i'm not here. why is there no record of other historians travelling back to witness events? we're obviously very careful. in fact, a colleague and i recently paid a call on a 22nd-century vessel. they hadn't perfected quarantine fields. you saw surgical masks? isn't it fascinating how everyone has different interests when it comes to history? different perspectives on progress. - would you tell me what that is? - just checking the time. is something important supposed to be happening? no, it's nothing. what about you? what do you see as the most important example of progress in the last 200 years? i suppose the warp coil. before there was warp drive, humans were confined to one sector of the galaxy. spoken like the consummate explorer! what is going on? are you expecting someone? - phasers. - i beg your pardon? there were no phasers in the 22nd century. see? our klingon friend is a perfect example of what i was telling you. he views history through the eyes of a hunter. a warrior. his passion lies in the perfection of the tools of violence. how delightfully primitive! when we input this data, the computer should tell us how many holes to punch. - how is tectonic stability? - couldn't be better. scans were all clear. there hasn't been a quiver in a century. just the two i'm looking for. i brought you the forms. shouldn't take more than a few hours. we're busy. tomorrow would be better. data, we've got 23,000 thermal simulations. - could you check for anomalies? - certainly. is that as fast as he can go? not fast enough for you? there's little known about data's efficiency. almost nothing about his part in this mission. it's a topic of great conjecture. 209 anomalies, all within acceptable parameters. thanks, data. you're here to witness this mission. that's it, isn't it? it'd be best if you thought of me as a fly on the wall and went about your business. i will have your answered questions soon. data at penthara iv! if you'll excuse me. your prosthesis, what do you call it again? - a visor. - visor. right. a visor. i have a picture of you wearing that. how do you like it? it allows me to see. i like it just fine. you know, homer was blind. milton, bach, monet, wonder. - a fly on the wall, huh? - fly on the wall. the computer has configured the drilling patterns. captain, i'm ready to transport down. l'll notify dr moseley. good luck, geordi. gentlemen. who said these moments are less exciting when you know the outcome? i know of no one who said that. enterprise will monitor the co2 concentrations at six altitudes. if all goes well, it should take only 20 bore sites. let's hope all goes well. la forge to cmdr riker. how are you doing? the monitoring stations are on line. we're ready when you are. excellent. all we need now is an open channel to data. open a channel, mr worf, and prepare to fire. the computer has locked in the phaser-depth calculations. - mr data? - ready, sir. fire. target one is emitting 2,000 cubic metres per second. target two, 1,600. surface wind patterns are stable. anything at altitude, data? co2 concentrations remain unchanged at upper elevations. have i missed much? target 14 complete, sir. data? - what have you got? - no change, sir. how are the surface winds, geordi? holding steady, sir. the computer has stopped drilling. you should be getting something now, data. elevated co2 levels at 20 kilometres, sir. now you're talking. we've got new temperatures. all stations report no further temperature drops. correction, two equatorial stations report slight increases. thank you, all. you've given us what we need. time. we're glad to be of help. we will continue to monitor your progress. picard out. ""you've given us what we need. time."" - return to synchronous orbit. - aye, sir. very clever, picard. well done! we always knew how you did it, but to experience the moment, to witness the nuances, it's indescribable. he's after more than a history lesson. - what are you getting from him? - i don't know. it's like he's trying to confuse us, misdirect us somehow. there you are! well, that certainly was exciting, wasn't it? is everything alright? are you well? yes. couldn't be better. i thought we might chat about your questionnaire. buck up, crewman! you're a credit to that uniform! i've got things to do. no, please, counsellor. i'd appreciate your remaining. doctor, in response to question six, you spoke of a neural stimulator. may i see one? i don't see why not. give me a minute. - you don't like me very much. - i don't dislike you, professor. keep your eyes wide, soldier. you'll tell your grandchildren you were at penthara iv. but you don't trust me. - you should. - should i? ""picard's empath won't trust you,"" they said. - picard's empath? - we're not that unalike, you and i. you possess a sense that is foreign to the others. my knowledge of the future is similar. some of my best friends are empaths. they trust me. why should you care if i trust you or not? we're birds of a feather. we're colleagues. we could learn a lot from each other. you're right. i don't trust you. - i knew you'd say that. - i'm sure you did. well, i'm glad you two are finally getting along. i really have to be going. thank you. why not try a berylite scan? i'd be interested to see what his micro-levels are. so, what else can i show you? you're a very curious woman. no, i don't mean curious like that. i mean, you're curious about things, about berylite levels, about the future. well, curiosity is why all of us are out here, isn't it? i understand. but you're different, you're more vibrant. - more... - more vibrant. that's nice. i like that. whenever i travel back, i meet very interesting people, men and women. but i've never met anyone who gave me thoughts about not going home. you're not supposed to be influencing the past, remember? and i am beginning to feel just a little bit influenced. anyway, i could be your great-great-great-great-grandmother. what kind of questions did he ask? he only asked about previous starships, what was innovative about the last enterprise. he wanted to see if we had a grasp of the fundamentals. his questions to me were on dr soong's... i am detecting a massive earthquake. two earthquakes. location? both are beneath the southern drill sites. is la forge there? - yes, sir. - find him. we've got volcanic activity. pretty severe. magnify. la forge here. moseley and i are on our way to his lab. are you alright? we're ok, but those were pretty big. if this was earth, l'd say 8.5 on the richter scale. we're starting to see some volcanic plumes. two more eruptions. we probably overestimated geologic stability around the co2 pockets. - we're in the lab, sir. - on screen. we're fairly quake-proof. it's the volcanic dust l'm worried about. what about the dust? the ash from the volcanoes will compound the existing problem. soon, no sunlight will get through. no amount of co2 will help us then. captain, take a look at this. these are the coordinates of the eruptions. and these are the coordinates of the phaser-drilling sites. the mantle is collapsing where the pressure was released. we have some ideas, but it will take time to sort them out. - sort them out, geordi. - aye, sir. we came here to help these people. and look what we've done. what in god's name is that? - music, professor. - music? yes, sir. mozart's jupiter symphony in c major, bach's brandenburg concerto no.3, beethoven's 9th symphony, second movement, molto vivace, and la donna e mobile from verdi's rigoletto. could you thin it out a bit? computer, eliminate program one. computer, eliminate program two. computer, eliminate program three. computer, half-volume. how the...? how can you listen to four pieces of music at the same time? i can distinguish over 150 simultaneous compositions. in order to analyse the aesthetics, i try to keep it to ten or less. only four today? i am assisting cmdr la forge with a complex calculation. it demands a great deal of concentration. i came to thank you for answering my questions. i should have asked you to limit yourself to 50,000 words. you did ask me to be thorough. i know it's hard to believe, but few records of dr soong's work survived to the 26th century. so it would be invaluable to myself, and other historians, if you could provide us with some schematics. certainly. once my work here is completed. as long as it's before 0900 tomorrow. that's when i head back. - bridge to data. - yes, worf? cmdr la forge is hailing you from the surface. patch him through, please. have you rerun the phase-reversal figures? there were no errors. the variance must be no more than.06 terawatts. i see no other choice. we'll continue to run the numbers but i doubt we'll find anything different. tell the captain the good news and the bad news. la forge out. which do you suppose he's gonna want to hear first? - the good news. - the motion of the dust has created electrostatic energy in the upper atmosphere. with a modified phaser blast, we can create a shock front to ionise the particles. that would be like a spark in a gas-filled room. with one exception. the particles would turn into high-energy plasma which our shields could absorb and redirect into space. turn the ship into a lightning rod? - precisely, sir. - the bad news? if our phaser discharge is off by just.06 terawatts, it would cause a cascading exothermal inversion. meaning? we would completely burn off the atmosphere. captain's log, supplemental. while dr moseley takes la forge's plan to the colony, i am weighing the consequences of a more philosophical issue. come. you know why i've asked you here. yeah, i have a fairly good idea. i'm faced with a dilemma. a planet beneath us is slowly turning to ice. unless we do something about it, in a matter of weeks, thousands, maybe tens of thousands, will die. that'd be a shame. yes, it would. it would be quite a shame. so, what's your dilemma? cmdr la forge has a possible solution. the margins of error are extremely critical, but if successful, there'll be no more threat. and if it's not successful? every living thing will perish. so, do nothing, and thousands will die. do something and millions could die. that's a tough choice. not if you were to help me. you're not suggesting i tell you the outcome? oh, no. i am not. everything i have ever believed in tells me i cannot ask you that. but, at the same time, there are 20 million lives down there. and you know what happened to them. what will happen to them. so, it seems you have another dilemma. one that questions your convictions. i've never been afraid of re-evaluating my convictions. now, i have 20 million reasons to do so. and why did you ask to see me? because your presence gives me a potential access to a kind of information that i've never had before. and if i am to re-examine my beliefs, then i must take advantage of every possible asset. it would be irresponsible not to ask you here. however you come to terms with your beliefs, i'm quite comfortable with mine. how can you be? how can you be comfortable watching people die? let me put it to you this way. if i were to tell you that none of them died, you'd conclude that you tried and succeeded. so you'd confidently try again. no harm in that. but what if i were to tell you they all died? you'd decide not to make the same mistake twice. what if one of the people grew up... i know! what if one of those lives i saved as a child grows up to be the next adolf hitler or khan singh? every philosophy student has been asked that since wormholes were discovered. but this is not a class in temporal logic! it's not theoretical or hypothetical. it's real! - surely you see that? - all too well. but you must see that if i were to influence you, everything in this sector, in this quadrant, could change. history, my history, would unfold in a way other than it already has. what possible incentive could anyone offer me to allow that to happen? i have two choices. either way, one version of history or another will wend its way forward. the history you know or another. who is to say which is better? what i do know is that here, today, one way, millions of lives could be saved. isn't that incentive enough? everyone dies, captain. it's just a question of when. all those people died years before i was born. all of you up here as well. i can't get quite as worked up as you over the fate of some colonists who, for me, have been dead a very, very long time. you know of the prime directive, which tells us we have no right to interfere in the natural evolution of alien worlds. i have sworn to uphold it. but, nevertheless, i have disregarded that directive, on more than one occasion, because i thought it was the right thing to do! now, if you are holding on to some temporal equivalent of that directive, then isn't it possible that you have an occasion here to make an exception, to help me choose, because it's the right thing to do? it's not just a choice. you're trying to manipulate the future. every choice we make allows us to manipulate the future. do i invite adrienne or suzanne to the spring dance? do i holiday on corsica or risa? a person's life, their future, hinges on each of a thousand choices. living is making choices! you ask me to believe that if i make a choice other than the one in your history books, then your past will be irrevocably altered. well, you know, professor, perhaps i don't give a damn about your past because your past is my future and as far as i'm concerned, it hasn't been written yet! the electrostatic conditions are about as good as they'll get. if we're going to try this, now's the time. please don't ask me, captain. i can't help you. i'm sorry. how long to program the phasers? we've just got to tie in to geordi's sensors. so you made your choice, without my help. on the contrary, you were quite helpful. how's that? by refusing to help, you left me with the choice i had to begin with. to try or not to try, to take a risk or to play it safe. your arguments have reminded me how precious the right to choose is. and because i've never been one to play it safe... ...i choose to try. - program the firing sequence. - aye, sir. captain's log, stardate 45351.9. dr moseley has met with the colony leaders who are all willing to take the risk. warp power has been rerouted from the deflector dish. keep the phasers on active surge control. we get one shot at this. - well, this is it! - is the sequence locked in? yes, sir. after an 8.3- second burst, we will discharge all eps taps through the phasers. time to return, mr la forge. mr o'brien, stand by. i can be more help here. we'll have to compensate for density variations. dr moseley's computers can accomplish that task, but geordi would be better able to anticipate variances. you know there's no guarantee this will work. if it fails... there's no guarantee it will fail, captain. l'd like your permission to remain here. - permission granted. - la forge remained below. - good luck, commander. - thank you. the deflector dish has been reconfigured, sir. proceed, mr data. stand by for auto-phaser interlock. activating deflector beam. eps taps on line. phasers firing. activating shield inverters now. mr la forge? la forge here. still breathing, captain. we've got particulate levels right where they should be and the sun is shining! see? i told you there was nothing to worry about. report back when you're ready. doctor, we'll analyse the remaining volcanic disturbances, but the best advice would be to let them cool down on their own. l'm getting in the habit of thanking you, picard. well, i'd love to see more, but it's nearly time to go. i am tickled pink to have had the opportunity of witnessing this. and you did it all without any help. well, must run. got some packing to do. you know you're taller in person, commander. look at this! who would have expected a teary farewell? we have to look inside your vessel. curious till the end, captain? you can't be serious. we've been through this. some objects have gone missing. if they're in your possession, we would like them returned. i'm not here in search of relics! i'm sure they'll turn up. if you will not open the vessel, i will, with explosives if necessary. i doubt you have the means. if we don't get in there, i guarantee you don't either. considering the sensitive nature of my equipment, you'll understand if i request that only mr data be allowed to see it. why data? because if i order data never to divulge what he sees, he won't, except anything that might belong to us. understood, sir. back in a minute. none of these items belong to you. nor does this. this phaser is set at the highest stun setting. if i'm correct, that is sufficient to immobilise even you. why have you stolen these objects? for a museum? far too valuable for that. in the century i come from, they haven't been invented. but this vessel, the temporal distortion on your arrival. this is a timepod and it is from the 26th century. at least, that's what the poor fella said. he travelled back to the 22nd century, that's my time, and had the misfortune to meet me. his clothes fit quite well. it took me weeks to figure out how to work this thing. you are not an historian? more of an inventor. until recently, a dismally unsuccessful one. what are your intentions? thanks to your captain, it seems they have changed slightly. i was quite content to return with these trinkets. i'd invent about one a year. but now, look what fortune has graced me with! you will take longer to figure out than a tricorder, but it should be well worth it. if the auto-timer is programmed the way i think it is, in about two minutes, we should be on our way back to a place called new jersey. i'm afraid you won't be awake for the ride. i assume your hand print will open this door whether you are conscious or not. that weapon was working yesterday. you were right to suspect him. but he is not from the future. he is from the past. trying to make my history unfold in a way other than it already has? this was all a misunderstanding. let me back in. we'll forget the whole thing. what possible incentive could i have to allow that? you will find all the missing items in the vessel. - doctor. - very nice performance. not all of it. some of it was real. captain. he claims to be a 22nd-century inventor, captain. if you were more inventive and fewer things had disappeared, we wouldn't have suspected. the stumbling block was your ship. our sensors couldn't penetrate it. once the door was open, the computer was able to detect and deactivate everything you'd stolen, including this. i'd love to hear more, but i must get back in that pod. take him to a detention cell, mr worf. notify starfleet that we will drop him off at starbase 214. you can't do this. i've got to get back. i don't belong here! no! i'm sure there are more than a few legitimate historians at starfleet who will be eager to meet a human from your era. professor? welcome to the 24th century."
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"and welcome to tonight's pleasure cruise, our social director is very resourceful and cooperative, our friend is getting a bit nervous, however he doesn't mind darts, but some of the passengers are interested in skeet shooting, using him as a skeet, tonight our crowded schedule, of fun and games includes a drama called, the last remains, first however, a word from our skipper. in time of sorrow, let us be your friend silver glen mortuary, amos duff speaking, oh oh, good morning sir uh, oh i have your bill right here at my desk, i’ll get a check in the mail this morning, yes sir, yes uh goodbye. good morning mr duff, nice day for a change, huh. well stanley i’m glad to see you're over your virus. oh yeah i’m okay now myself. -stanley... -yes sir? -that shirt. you like it? i got four of them on sale. stanley, do you really think a shirt like that, is in keeping with the dignity of this establishment? -oh the stiffs don't mind. -don't ever use that vulgar word, and i’m not referring to the deceased, i’m referring to customers. oh them, ain't seen many of them around lately. oh you're mistaken i had one only yesterday, while you were recuperating, i picked up the body myself, the late mr robert kessler, he's in the back now. he's swell? i mean i’m glad business is picking up mr duff. well i’m afraid it isn't picking up in the grand style, the gentleman who made the arrangements is mr kessler’s business partner, foley, marvin foley, seems that mr foley doesn't care very much about his partner's farewell rights, he's ordered the number five funeral. number five? the economy service, i mean we won't get rich on that. gee, i’m sorry mr duff. yes, we're living in a chain society stanley, the old values are disappearing, you know how many class a funerals i’ve sold in the past five years? -no sir. -not a single one, and yet for the splendid services i offer the price is remarkably low. that's too bad mr duff. i mean no funeral director in this city, can offer a more elaborate service, i mean not just flowers stanley but, but a gigantic wreath in the shape of a harp, -you see the significance? -yeah sure. i put my heart and soul into designing the class a funeral, and what happens? i mean all they want is a, is a plain box with with brass handles and, and a rush, rush service, now, is that any way to treat our loved ones? that's a shame, not a single class a funeral? not a one, sometimes i, i think the only class a funeral i’ll ever sell will be my own, however with the way business is now, i doubt if i could afford it myself. well i guess i better go take a look at the old boy. what? i mean mr kessler. -that's better, you go ahead stanley. -yes sir. silver glenn mortuary, amos duff speaking, oh good morning mr davis uh, yes uh yes i know it's two months overdue i’ll get a check in the mail this week, oh you can count on it, yes, uh goodbye. -i just saw kessler. -what? you know the new job, boy is he a mess, hey what happened to him mr duff? oh auto accident poor fellow, i’m afraid the damage was rather extensive, but mr foley doesn't wish any major repairs. hey you know there's a funny kind of a puncture right over his rib cage. -puncture? well i didn't notice that. -yeah well it's there all right. well i think i’ll go have another look at it. hey you want me to vacuum up front? uh, -oh i first throw that rubbish out in the back. -yes sir. you were right stanley, there is a puncture. -well i got good eyes, 20/20. -well so you have, it's a strange kind of wound, i mean for an accident, well i suppose some foreign body could have lodged there, some mechanical part perhaps. but then again it could be something else, i’ve seen similar wounds before but they were usually caused by a, buy a bullet. a bullet? well you said the guy was in a crash. well that's what the death certificate stated, oh... i, i suppose it's just a puncture of some sort nothing to worry about, you know, stanley, you still don't look very well to me. -i don't. -well you have to be careful with these viruses, very easy to have a relapse, uh maybe you should take the day off. you mean it mr duff? -certainly go ahead. -gee thanks, so long mr duff. i’ll see you tomorrow. here you are, the march 9 newspaper you requested, -be sure to return it to my desk when you're through. -yes thank you. executive killed in crash march 8th, robert d kessler, 51, president of the kj toy company, was killed last night in an auto owned and driven by his business partner, marvin j foley, both men are of harrington, mr kessler and his partner were returning from a hunting trip in maine, hunting trip in maine? mr foley has seen the toys, and you maybe come out now, -yes? -i’d uh like to see mr foley please. do you have an appointment? oh well no, my name is amos duff, i’m the proprietor of the silver glen mortuary, i want to see mr foley about, -well about the arrangements for mr kessler. -oh i see, mr foley there's a mr glenn of the silver duff mortuary here, do you want to see him? it's a silver glenn, i’m duff. you may go in mr glenn. well what is it mr duff? i thought we settled everything yesterday. -oh yes so we did. -that's right i ordered your, uh what do you call it? your, uh economy class funeral? and that's what i want, as i told you mr kessler had no family, so i see no point in having anything any more elaborate. oh yes i recall that, i, i didn't come to talk about the funeral mr foley. -oh... -not exactly, it's just that i uh, well i discovered something rather... -unusual. -unusual? sit down mr duff, what do you mean unusual? well you remember that you instructed me not to bother, about cosmetic repairs to uh poor mr kessler? so? well nevertheless i did find a, well shall i say unsightly wound. go on. perhaps i don't have to be explicit, oh no, i rather think that you do. oh, oh i’m sorry, i, i suppose i just made a mistake, i’ll fill out the customary police report. just a minute, sit down, -here have a cigarette mr duff. -well thank you. -you're welcome. -it's not that i want to make any kind of fuss mr foley but, i’ve been embalming bodies for a good number of years, now and i can pretty well spot a bullet wound when i see one. bullet wound? but mr duff that's ridiculous, mr kessler was killed in an automobile accident, i think i should know, i was there. yes of course, but about this puncture, it does rather resemble a bullet hole, of course i haven't probed for any bullets yet, but i could do that, it looks like the sort of wound that might be made by say, a high-speed rifle with a steel jacketed bullet, you know the kind they use for hunting. and this bothers you, does it? oh no, no, i i wouldn't say that, well to be blunt mr foley, it seems a shame that, that a man of mr kessler’s standing, should should be put to rest with so little fanfare, i mean it's like an insult to his memory, don't you agree? well i don't know i’ve got quite a few reminders of my old partner, the factory, even this office, it belonged to him too. well it just doesn't seem right to me, an economy-class funeral for an executive like mr kessler. and what do you suggest mr duff? well i would suggest something more fitting, a full-scale funeral with all the trimmings nothing but the best, in our catalog we refer to it as the class a. class a, huh? i see. frankly mr foley i doubt if there's a better funeral value in town, than our class a service, not just flowers mind you, but a gigantic wreath in the shape of a lovely harp, -you see the significance? -yes i do, and i think it's very very clever of you mr duff. and not just music mr foley but, a special recording i had made of angels sing thee to thy rest, as for the coffin itself... -mr duff... exactly how much will this class a funeral of yours cost me? uh, eighteen hundred dollars, -but let me tell you what it is... -eighteen hundred dollars, huh? eighteen hundred dollars, would that include cremation? cremation? cremation. -well yes it could i suppose. -good, you know, now that i stopped to think of it mr kessler, once mentioned something about wanting to be cremated, and i think we should respect that wish, don't you? oh by all means. now here, here's a check for six hundred dollars, -i paid you 150 yesterday... -uh-huh. that's a total of 750 dollars, the rest of it you'll get just as soon as mr kessler has been cremated. well thank you mr foley that's very thoughtful of you. oh i certainly hope we can do more business together. -good morning mr duff. -good morning stanley. well it's a payday today mr duff. well anything wrong? well it's just that you sort of promised me a raise if i stayed with you three months. well i’m sorry about that stanley, but business hasn't been so good lately, what with the recession and all. well i didn't think that would affect your business. well you'd be surprised, besides i’m having a little trouble with accounts receivable. well what about the kessler funeral last month? that was a blockbuster mr duff i never saw so many flowers in my whole life. well that's just what i mean, mr foley hasn't paid the balance of his bill yet, i’ve sent him three notices already and i haven't heard a word. why don't you call him at his office? well you think i haven't tried? i’ve called him five times this week and he's always in conference. mr duff, do you think that he's a deadbeat? well he'd better not be. hello i want to speak to mr marvin foley please, never mind who this is, just put me through to mr foley, what? well uh all right, it's, it's amos duff of the silver glen mortuary and, now look you've been giving me that story every time i’ve called, i want to speak to mr foley and i want to speak to him right now, well now listen here... i’ll disturb him plenty if he won't talk to me. no if you'd like to leave a message... -wait a minute what's going on out here? -oh hello mr foley. oh so it's you. i just thought i’d drop by and discuss that little business matter of ours. okay come on inside. i’m sorry to break in on you like this mr foley but, it's been so difficult to reach you. well why'd you want to see me about? well you know your bill, you know i’d almost given up hope, i’ve sent you three notices for the balance and you haven't answered. i don't know what you're talking about. why, why of course you do mr foley, the bill for mr kessler’s funeral, the class a arrangement, oh it was really a beautiful affair. but i was under the impression that bill had already been paid in full. well no sir i i mean we discussed it right here in your office. oh yes i remember the conversation very distinctly, you were very persuasive about getting mr kelsey, your class a service and that's what mr kessler got, -your class a service. -well yes sir, but what about the bill? the bill has already been paid in full mr duff, if you don't believe me i suggest that you consult the price list in your own catalog, you don't have a service that cost more than 750 dollars, and i have cancelled checks for exactly that amount. but these circumstances were different. different how? will you know i mean you were gonna pay me 1800 dollars. i was gonna pay you 1800 dollars dollars for a750 dolalrs funeral? you apparently don't think i’m much of a businessman mr duff. well now look if you think you can get away with this... get away with what? well you know darn well what, with murder. well what do you intend to do about it, call the police? -well you think i won't? -and what will you show the police mr duff? the bullet hole in mr kessler’s body? no, you're not going to be foolish enough to make, a ridiculous statement like that to the police, after all there's a death certificate that proves, that mr kessler was killed in an automobile accident, and you have no proof to the contrary, you ought to know that mr duff, you buried the evidence yourself, now look, why don't you be a nice fellow and forget the whole thing, huh? suppose we make it 1500? not another penny, if i pay you one cent more than you're entitled to i’ll be paying you forever, so i don't intend to start now, you're a pretty shrewd businessman mr duff, and this is just good business, don't you agree? thank you john. all right, you just signed that statement mr duff, it's just as you dictated it, you uh better check it over to be sure, okay sarge you can bring him in now. uh lieutenant uh do i have to be here when uh mr foley comes in? i’m afraid you do mr duff, but it won't take long. look this is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous, dragging me down here like this. take it easy mr foley, i’m lieutenant morgan, okay boys. so it's you, i suppose this was your idea you jerky little crackpot. i said take it easy mr foley, perhaps you don't realize it but, -you're facing a very serious charge. -a serious charge? -are you kidding? -no i’m not kidding. but this man is a screwball, uh look look tell him i don't know what he's been telling you, all i know that he's nothing but a liar and a thief. that's what we're here to find out mr foley, now if we just sit down we can talk this over calmly. okay. mr foley this rifle belong to you? well of course it does, you men took it out of my apartment. they hit a warrant sir, just a nice looking weapon. thank you. i uh suppose i have a hunting license for it? well it's a hunting rifle naturally i have a hunting license. mr duff here seems to think that uh, you had another use of this weapon, the dispose of your late business partner, robert kessler. what is this some kind of a joke? mr kessler was killed in an automobile crash, -i have a death certificate. -we have a photo start of it. -well have you read it? -of course i’ve read it. can you still believe this? this penny any little grave digger here. mr duff told us a very disturbing story mr foley, it uh, raises a possibility that the coroner might have missed something during his examination. what possibility? that you shot and killed your partner before your car went over the aqueduct, trusting that the body would be so damaged, the bullet hole would go unnoticed. but lieutenant this whole thing is absolutely ridiculous, -it's just not true. -but i’m afraid it is mr foley, we got evidence of the contrary, that's why we brought you down here. what do you mean evidence, what evidence could you have? oh, well you see mr foley, you requested that mr kessler’s body be cremated, and in such cases we like to supply a little memento of the, loved one to the closest kin or friend, it's all part of the class a service, you see, the bullet was steel jacketed so it didn't really melt, when they found the bullet among the ashes, they included it among the remains, that's why i had to come to the police. too bad mr foley didn't consider burial at sea, it's simple and inexpensive, besides, the trip back can be much more enjoyable for the bereaved, all that sierra, you know, and now that i mention it, i see a quantity of hot air coming our way, i shall re-emerge after it has passed by. i am pacifying our social director, by playing a game of his choosing, i’m to pin the tail on the donkey, fortunately you do not have to suffer through this childish nonsense, you may be excused until next week at the same time, so until then, good night."
0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"captain's log, stardate 46461.3. we are at a communication station near the klingon border,  where we are meant to deliver supplies.  however, the station has not responded to repeated hails.  - what's that noise? - they left a monitoring system on. we're hearing thousands of subspace messages. i'll try and shut it off. got it! - geordi, what's that? - sounds like a loose panel. i think it's coming from this service duct over here. here's your loose panel. hey, pooch! hey, pooch. come on out of there. come on! come on! hey, pooch! what are you doing in there? commander, the shuttlecraft is gone. there is no one on board. commander? - what is it? - cellular residue. i believe these are the remains of one of our lieutenants. space, the final frontier.  these are the voyages of the starship enterprise.  its continuing mission,  to explore strange new worlds...  to seek out new life and new civilisations...  ... to boldly go where no one has gone before.  all the blood traces i've found match those of lt aquiel uhnari. i take it those are her remains, but i'll check the deck plate to be sure. it would take a powerful weapon to do that. - i'll have a better idea soon. - if that is uhnari, where's rocha? the station shuttle's gone. maybe he took it. before uhnari died or after? we're ready, commander. - any luck downloading the logs? - i can't pass the security. i think i know why. encrypted messages are sent through this channel. take a look at this signal notation. - it's out of sequence. - someone tried to bypass protocols and break into the coded messages. that froze the security locks. - any messages missing? - i'll know once i'm in the files. - looks like you've made a friend! - yep! tell me when you have something. i'm going to try accessing the logs from another console. what's going on here? well, we can start with repolarising the interface. what is it, pup? what's the matter? something over here? this doesn't look like it belongs to you. this is what you want, huh? there you go! computer, run station logs in sequence. station log, stardate 46458.3. today we configured the relay-controller grid.  it was the last system we had to overhaul.  we are scheduled to align antenna systems in the next three days.  computer, access visual output. sent third request for a message delay buffer.  until it arrives, we have rigged a memory module to compensate.  it better work,  or a half-million subspace messages are going to end up drifting through space.  computer,  open uhnari correspondence file.  computer, access correspondence files, lt aquiel uhnari. hello, shiana.  sorry it's been a while.  i've been dealing with the new lieutenant, rocha.  he's arrogant and condescending,  and he's only been here two days.  this might be a long year.  c'mon, lieutenant. stick with me. i had the dream again.  mother's calling out my name.  she's in the house. i get to the top of the hill but the house is slanted.  i'm still walking uphill.  i can't find her.  doors everywhere and they all look the same.  the cellular residue is completely fused to the deck plate. we're trying to micro-vaporise the metal to get a clear dna sample. do you have any idea what killed her? well, this is just a guess, but from the molecules of the plating i'd say it was caused by a high-level phaser blast. - a klingon disruptor? - possibly. the messages have been tampered with. and we are close to klingon space. there hasn't been a klingon raid against us for more than seven years. we can't risk a diplomatic incident without more evidence. and there's still the question of what happened to lt rocha. get rocha's file from starfleet command and ask starbase 212 to help us find the shuttle. keep me apprised, doctor. alright, let's try this again. come on, this should be working! the phase inducers are aligned. come on, lieutenant. i know you're in here somewhere. computer, run me a subsystems diagnostic with a frequency range of 10 to 100mhz. diagnostic cycle will be complete in 20 seconds.  iced coffee? what is it, girl? - hello, shiana.  - there! by the time you get this,  the batarael will be over.  it's the first time i haven't been there.  i've been wondering, who's singing the harath in my place?  i had that dream again,  the one where mother is screaming.  i climb the hill to our house,  but i can't get to her.  shiana, this time i ran away.  i was so scared,  i ran back down the hill.  i think i know why i've been having the dreams about danger.  it's because of what's been happening with that klingon.  he's getting more aggressive all the time.  not just the usual threat.  it's because of what's been happening with that klingon.  he's getting more aggressive all the time.  not just the usual threat.  morag actually locked his disruptors to the station this time.  i don't think there'll be any trouble.  it just... brings up those feelings of... panic,  of wanting to run,  wanting to get away from danger.  shiana, i couldn't say this to anyone but you, but the panic...  it's the same thing i used to feel whenever father got angry,  when i knew he was going to punish me.  only now, i'm out here in space.  and there's nowhere to run.  three times she refers to cmdr morag, a klingon who patrols this section. apparently he passed by the station every few days and harassed them. perhaps this morag was interested in obtaining the encrypted messages. she didn't say but i do have several more days of logs to watch. - i'm hoping to learn more. - very well. in the meantime i'll speak with the klingon governor about cmdr morag. are you saying we attacked your outpost? i'm merely saying i'm following up on evidence discovered on board. evidence. so you are making an accusation? the klingon empire will not stand for these kinds of lies. governor torak, i apologise. i see that you honestly didn't know what happened aboard the station. i will just have to take this up with gowron. i'm sorry we bothered you. gowron won't bother with such a minor incident. ordinarily he wouldn't but i was his arbiter of succession. i'm sure he will be happy to come and investigate this. you needn't worry about it any longer. - gowron will come here? - oh, yes. so once again, thank you for your help. i will be sure to mention your name to gowron when i speak to him. i will investigate this further, picard. you need not bother gowron with this matter. that's very kind. - qapla'!  - qapla'!  computer, access the personal logs of aquiel uhnari. - logs accessed.  - begin playback. shiana, you always said i'd look great in a wig.  so here it is.  what do you think?  definitely not you. ok. maybe i'm getting a little crazy.  you would, too, stuck on a relay station in the middle of nowhere with no one for company except an egomaniac like keith rocha.  i took a big risk today.  i countermanded an order he gave.  i agreed to handle the comm traffic for relay station 194 while they shut down for maintenance.  rocha said we couldn't handle the extra signal load but i think he's wrong.  when he finds out, he'll be furious.  it's days like this i wish i was home.  you know what i miss most?  muskan seed punch.  real muskan seed punch.  the replicator has it but it's not the same.  i'd give anything for the punch mother used to make,  with chunks of the seed still in it.  keith, is that you?  keith?  commander. there are dna traces here. klingon. - so klingons did board the station? - yes. but i only found dna from one klingon so far. i will continue to scan. how could she read this stuff? how's it going? i've accessed all lt uhnari's logs. i'm still looking for lt rocha's. whatever happened to the encrypted messages affected the whole system. i can't find his files anywhere. i'm running a diagnostic now. maybe rocha didn't make the logs. that could have been uhnari's job. i don't think so. aquiel was the junior officer. aquiel? lt uhnari. i've been up all night watching her. i'm starting to feel i know her. what was she like? well, she was haliian. she had one sister named shiana. she drank muskan seed punch. she... had a quirky sense of humour. she liked to sing. she... had questionable taste in literature. - enterprise to cmdr riker.  - riker here. the klingon ship qu'vat has arrived with governor torak.  report to the observation lounge.  we're on our way. governor torak, sir. welcome aboard. do not bore me with your human pleasantries. i told you we did not kill the woman. now i will prove it to you. this is lt aquiel uhnari. we were running a diagnostic of the message buffer. nothing special. rocha had been on edge all morning. but he'd constantly been irritable so i didn't think anything of it. we were halfway through the procedure when suddenly he... attacked me. he threw me against a bulkhead. i yelled at him to stop but he wouldn't listen. he grabbed my throat, i broke free and tried to get to the weapons locker. i'm not sure what happened next but somehow i got aboard the shuttle and left. we found her on our side of the border, heading toward sector 2520. she is lucky my patrol ship did not destroy her vessel on sight. lieutenant... why didn't you contact starfleet? let them know what had happened at the station. i don't know, sir. maybe i passed out. i'm not even sure how long i was on this shuttle before i was picked up. 46 hours. you've been gone 46 hours. we presumed you were dead. your blood was found at the murder scene. i must have cut my head when he pushed me. then the remains we found must be those of lt rocha. i can't confirm that. until we separate the cellular residue from the deck plate, i can't do a clear dna scan. you said you were trying to get to the weapons locker. - is there a possibility you did? - no, i... didn't. you're sure? i don't remember exactly what happened to me after i was attacked. i'm sorry. it's as if all my memories were drained out of me. morag was harassing you. did you let him or any other klingon on board? absolutely not. if that is true, then morag or some other klingon boarded the station after she left. we found traces of klingon dna on the station. you still try to blame us! have the courage to admit your mistakes. or are you a lo'be vos?  at last i do not wear the uniform of the pahtk!  governor, we are merely exploring all possibilities. lt uhnari's logs reported that cmdr morag had been harassing the station. he was doing his job. in that case, i am sure you would not mind if we spoke with him. very well. in the interests of diplomacy i will allow you to speak to morag. but my patience has limits. lieutenant, i know a friend of yours who's eager to see you. who? come with me. maura! come here, girl! come on, maura! maura? that's the name, huh? yes, it's from cold moon over black water.  have you read it? - i'm not much for gothic fiction. - not many people are nowadays. your shoe! yeah, maura got a little restless. shame on you! that's not like you. what a naughty dog. don't worry about it. at least she's chewing them up in pairs. i'll arrange quarters for you. you'll want some time alone. actually, i've been stuck on that station for nine months. i wouldn't mind somewhere with activity. i know just the place. here you are, sir. - thank you. - you're welcome. - ever tried muskan seed punch? - it nearly made me sick. you have to be raised on it. it's nutritious. the taste grows on you. you speak haliian! we travelled a lot when i was a kid. i picked up a couple of languages. we never travelled. my family lived in the same house for five generations. the one on the hill. how do you know about that? well, to be honest, when we thought you were dead, i needed to review your logs and... personal correspondence for any possible clues about what happened. all of it? most of it, yeah. you need to understand, we thought you'd been murdered. we needed information. i'm sorry. it's just that i tell my sister things i wouldn't tell anyone else. i guess i was feeling a little... exposed. i'd feel the same way. especially if i had seen you in that wig! it really wasn't you. i'm curious. now that you've met me, am i what you expected? actually, i... i'm not sure. the woman i saw in those logs is complicated. i think there's more to you than meets the eye. in what way? well, your relationship with lt rocha, for example. he was only there for five days, yet there was plenty of friction. you seemed to delight in doing things that you knew would upset him. why take on extra comm traffic when it would make him angry? is this a personal question or part of a murder investigation? i don't know. maybe both. keith rocha was obnoxious from the minute he reported to duty. he treated me as though i was beneath contempt. i felt like i had to battle him to hold my own. but i didn't want to see him dead. why do you think he attacked you? i don't know. rocha's file is spotless. two decorations for valour. three outstanding commander's evaluations. doesn't sound like the same man lt uhnari described. - what did you find out about her? - her last posting was on deriben v. her commanding officer said she was argumentative, quick to take offence. he told me he transferred her to that relay station because she was ""hampering their efforts"". - i'm having trouble believing her. - why? i sent worf to check the weapons locker. there's a phaser missing. - you think that she lied? - lied, conveniently forgot... i'm not sure. it's something we have to consider. as of now, we don't have sufficient evidence either way. i want you to examine her shuttle. you might find something to shed some light on her story. aye, sir. how much longer will the investigation take? three, maybe four days. it's tough to tell. i know i'm a suspect in the murder. but let me ask you something. you've watched my logs. you know me better than anyone here. do i seem like a person who would murder someone? no, you don't. i don't think i realised how much i needed to hear that. look, aquiel, it's been a rough couple of days. you need some sleep. you called me complicated. you're right. i don't make friends easily. oumriel.  oumriel.  commander! it is set to kill. we found this phaser in your craft. it was taken from the weapons locker. i don't remember what happened! maybe i did make it to the weapons locker. it was set to level ten! phasers are always set at level one when they're put in storage. that means that somebody deliberately changed the setting. then there's your conflict with lt rocha. rocha and i had our disagreements. that does not mean i would kill him. have you been able to remember what happened? no. nothing. i suppose maybe in self-defence i... to inflict the type of molecular damage found in rocha's remains, it would take a sustained phaser discharge of 30 to 40 seconds. - it doesn't sound like self-defence. - now wait a minute. we don't even know this phaser is the murder weapon. and even at level ten i don't see how it could have done that damage. a klingon weapon, maybe... we're not making accusations. we want to find out what happened. cmdr morag is on his way. - let's hear his story. - fine. in the meantime, i'd like to try to access rocha's personal logs again. good idea. geordi? wait a second. - thank you, mr worf. - aye, sir. this is off the record, said as a friend, not a superior officer. it would be best if you weren't so personally involved with aquiel. - there's a lot we don't know. - there's a lot i do know. and if she's innocent, i want to help her prove it. i think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. i'm not the one making judgements. got it! computer, display the records of lt rocha from stardates 46455 to 46460. computer, what happened to the log entries for stardate 46459? the logs have been deleted.  - who deleted them? - unknown.  captain's log, supplemental.  the qu'vat has arrived with cmdr morag.  we're preparing to question him regarding the murder of lt rocha.  i killed no one! we found your dna on the bulkheads and the console. - we know you were there! - answer their questions. yes. yes, i was there. my route takes me near the station every six days. three days ago, i hailed them. there was no response. i was... concerned. - concerned? - yes. i went aboard to see what had happened. there was no one there, so i left. - is that all? - that's all. cmdr morag, we found the encrypted message bank has been tampered with. analysis indicates that 27 priority starfleet messages are missing. what of it? your dna was found on the message-control module. this is outrageous! we will not tolerate these accusations. this is a diplomatic matter, morag! do not make me search your ship. yes. i did take the messages. - did you kill lt rocha? - no! i killed no one. there was no one there. i took the codes but i killed no one. governor, we would like cmdr morag to remain on board until this investigation is completed. take him. this way. last night, after i dropped you off, you established a subspace link with this console. you deleted some of rocha's files, didn't you? - yes, i did. - why? i found a letter rocha planned to send to starfleet command about me. it said i had become belligerent and insubordinate. he was going to ask for a formal hearing. - geordi, i know how this looks. - yeah, it looks bad. you've erased a letter containing a possible motivation for murder? - i didn't kill him. - then explain this! i was afraid if they found the letter they'd blame me for the murder. i'm not a model officer. i realise that. sometimes i act on impulse instead of thinking things through. aquiel, this really complicates things. - what are you doing? - getting out of here. running won't prove your innocence. facing this will. - i'm scared, geordi! - look. we'll get through this. i promise you, ok? then you believe me? yes, i do. medical officer's log. i've isolated the cellular residue from the deck,  but the dna has destabilised.  i'm attempting to reform it.  alright, initiate the resonance frequency burst. i'm beginning to get a stable dna scan. this is odd. the nucleotide sequences are beginning to fluctuate. the dna is becoming mobile. let's try another frequency burst. increase the resonance level by 20%. i haven't been this close to someone in a long time. i don't want to let go of it. neither do i but we've got 600 logs to go through. alright. but first there's something i want to share with you. what? a way that we can become more intimate. my people are partially telepathic. we use something called the canar to help focus our thoughts. we also use the canar for a stronger emotional link during love. i was wondering what that was for. do both of us have to be telepathic for it to work? let's find out. like this. think of me. an exact reproduction of my hand, right down to the dna structure. this was formed from the organic matter taken from the deck plates? when i infused it with a resonance-frequency burst it activated its dna. then it touched my hand and it began to mimic my cellular structure. what exactly is this? this sounds far-fetched, but have you ever heard of a coalescent organism? no. they're microscopic life forms which absorb other organisms to survive. that in itself isn't so unusual, but coalescents become the organisms, right down to the cellular level. is this what happened with your hand? there have been reports that these organisms can be quite large. what happened to my hand seems to support that. was rocha killed by one of these organisms? it's possible that something happened to him before he reported for duty. - i do not understand. - i've checked the records. before he was posted to the station, rocha served in the triona system. that is a remote sector. maybe he was absorbed by a coalescent on that mission. so, there could have been an organism that looked and acted like lt rocha? how often do they have to change bodies? the microscopic organisms have a cycle of no more than ten seconds. we can only assume that a larger, more complex coalescent would have a cycle of days, even weeks. if that's true, then rocha attacked lt uhnari to find a new body. - right. - that means uhnari is a coalescent. there was one other person on the station. morag. it is possible he was the one who was... absorbed. computer, locate cmdr morag and lt uhnari. cmdr morag is in his quarters.  lt uhnari is not on the enterprise.  where did she go? lt uhnari transported to relay station 47 at 1830 hours.  - get morag. i'll go to the station. - aye, sir. - geordi? - i can see you! and i can feel you. do not move! - what is this? - you will come with me. you've never been as close to someone as you are about to be. think of me. step away from him, lieutenant. - what are you doing, commander? - that may not be lt uhnari. - what? - what are you saying? step away, now. medical officer's log.  cmdr morag and lt uhnari are being kept under close observation.  so far no sign of coalescent behaviour has surfaced.  aquiel and morag will be transferred to a secure hospital on starbase 12. - we'll know more once we're there. - yeah? right. it could be morag. we don't know for sure. sure. get some rest. you've had a rough couple of days. thanks. computer. display the engineering duty roster for the next three days. not now. i said, not now. give me a break here! go lay down! maura? maybe the reason you don't remember anything is that the coalescing process had begun. thank you. you said you felt your memories had been drained out of you. that's probably exactly what was going on. maybe i did take the phaser. whatever happened, at least you got away before the process took hold. - so he turned on maura. - right. well... what now? i guess i'll be going to starbase 212 for reassignment. i had a talk with chief pendleton in communications. there's an opening for a level-two specialist. really? with the waiting list, i'd be grey before i got here. i could put in a good word. it's an appealing offer, but i think i'd rather get here on my own merits. don't be surprised if you see my name on that list.

"" or humphrey bogart in ""casablanca"", when he lies to victor laszlo to spare his feelings. i understand, sir. how often have we watched that movie? i know it can be noble to lie. i just can't. kryten, you can. look, what's this? it's a banana. it always has been. it always will be. it's a yellow fruit that you unzip and eat. a banana. - lister, is kryten with you? - yeah, what's the prob? i've been waiting 20 minutes for him in the hangar, oh, spin my nipple nuts and send me to alaska! i'm supposed to take him asteroid spotting. - i'll be right down, sir. - you'd better be, kryten, remember yesterday's class on insults? - i'm not sure... - how do we describe that gentleman? - he's mr... - no, no, no. he's a... - he's a smeee... - nearly. come on. nearly. - he's a smeee... - he's a... he's a smeee... he's a smeeeg... heeeeead. i did it! brutal. now the ultimate test - can you say it to him in person? ah, kryten. at last. glad you could make it this millennium. smeeeee... - pardon? - smeeeee... heeeee... - what? - you're a smeeeee... heeeee... oh, forget it. kryten, could we go just a bit faster? so we're not being overtaken by stationary objects? sir, you're a smeeeee... - a smee. - a smeeeee... heeeee... a smee-hee. a complete and total one. i'm picking something up. some kind of distress beacon. i copy that, holly. quadrant four-niner-seven. - what is it? - hard to tell, but it's marooned on a planet in decaying orbit. - safety margin? - planet'll explode in two hours. - forget it. it's too dangerous. - we can't leave them, sir. - there may be survivors. - leave it, kryten. that's an order. - what are you doing? - i'm not taking her down. - yes, you are. - nor am i checking the vessel for survivors. kryten, this is mutiny. i could have you dismantled. smeeeee... heeeee... oh, damn my programming! not back yet? they've been hours. - no sign. what are you watching? - just a vid. - this is a classic. - what is it? ""tales of the riverbank: the next generation. "" oh, right. i've seen this. it's not as good as the original. well, they never replaced hammy hamster. how could they? the dude smouldered. the camera loved him. yeah. he was the rodent equivalent of marlon brando. whatever happened to old hammy? one minute he's a huge star with a personalised gold wheel and as much edam as he could hold in his little cheeks, the next, obscurity. probably went on the slide. the series ended, couldn't find work, and then the ultimate humiliation... hamstergrams. well, thanks a bunch, thanks a smegging buncharoony, - rimmer, where are you? - that idiot droid has endangered this vessel by landing on a planet that's about to explode, thanks to your foundation course in advanced rebellion, - why? - to search some starship escape vessel because there's a million-to-one chance there may be a survivor, - you let him go alone? - of course, i was glad to get rid of him, he's flipped, he's got mad droid disease, he kept waving a banana around and calling it a female aardvark, well, you'd better get after him. - he might need help. - lister, this is your fault, hello? is there anyone here? can anyone read me? oh, dear. what a terrible mess. help! mr rimmer, sir! sir? i thank you from the bottom of my rehydration units. you saved my life. you responded to my distress call. you saved mine. - my name is kryten. - camille. pleased to meet you. - are you a 4,000 series? - yes, i'm the 4,000 series gti. gti! oh, wow! i'm just a plain old 4,000 series. you've got all the luxury extras, like realistic toes and a slide-back sunroof head. why are you looking at me like that? sorry. stare mode cancel. it's just you have really amazing eyes. well... they're just the old 579s with the automatic 15f-stop cornea. i could pop them out and you could borrow them. heck. what a jerky thing to say. i don't believe you would ever say anything jerky. - really? - really. wow. uh, listen, i... i know this will sound like a corny line, but do you know that the configuration of your features is extraordinarily apposite? - you really know all the lines. - no, i really mean it. the way the light catches your head - it's enchanting. - i am kryten. - you already said. oh, yes. you must think me as stupid as a photocopier. so, where are the crew? what happened here? kryten, do you believe in advanced mutual compatibility on the basis of a primary initial ident? what humans call ""love at first sight""? that would be an adequate synonym. until a moment ago, i'd have said the probability was zero squared. - and now? - uh... this gantry is unstable. i suggest you hang on to me. oh, what is that fragrance? it smells divine. - wd-40. - i knew it. i knew it. i use it on my neck hinges too. kryten, this shouldn't be happening. do you feel it too? you mean the 93.72% compatibility factor? - i make it 93.75. - oh, yes. i forgot to carry the three. - say it. say the words. - it sounds ridiculous from a mechanoid. - then say them in machine language. - ok. in z80012, using hex rather than binary, and converting to a basic asc2 code, camille, i think i e5-a9-08-b7 you. - you really mean that? - camille, i'd do anything for you. i'd compute a three-million-digit prime number to make you happy. i'd evaluate pi to infinity to make you smile. oh, kryten. you make the most romantic calculations. kryten, can you read me? what's happening? - there are others? - yes, why? - i can't meet them. - what do you mean? two of us alone could work. don't make me explain. but this whole planet is about to blow. i can't meet your shipmates. trust me. but you'll like them. well, some of them. well, one of them... maybe. sir. i'm making my way back. - what's kept you? - i've found a survivor. we're coming in. kryten, don't make me do this. i'm begging you. just relax. everything's going to be fine. mr rimmer, sir? - where the smeg have you been? - mr rimmer, camille. camille, second tech rimmer. she saved my life, sir. yes, well... howdy. - howdy. - you see? i knew you'd get along. well, i'd better start the engines and get us clear of the impact zone. - i'll come with you. - no, no. you stay and get acquainted. can i get you anything... or anything? no. no, no. i'm fine, thanks. i can't believe i've met another hologram after all these years. - yes. i was second technician on that crate. - that's what i am. i wanted to go further, but i'm a dope in exams. me too. so, er... what do they call you? well, my first name is arnold, but the guys generally call me... duke. - duke? - yes, well... not absolutely all the time. in fact, sometimes months elapse without being called ""duke"" at all. so don't call me ""duke"" in front of anyone... because they might have forgotten... that they call me ""duke"". sorry, i'm no good at small talk. - oh, i think you're perfectly charming. - do you? well, thank you. no one's ever said i was charming before. they've said, ""rimmer, you're a total git,"" but never charming, no. - well, i think you're very charming. - really? very, very charming. well, thank you. um... thank you. i'd just better go and see how er... kryten's getting on. excusez-moi. - she's quite something, isn't she, sir? - she's enchanting. - you think so? - she's got everything - style, taste, poise... - she's absolutely lovely. - oh, i'm so glad you think so, sir. i'll tell you, i think there's romance in the air. you sly old dog, krytie! i think you're right. sure, her nose is a little loose, but that's just cute. i'll tell you something. she's so like my sister-in-law janine, it's untrue. camille looks like your sister-in-law? what happened? was she involved in a car accident? who? janine? no, she was a model. - and she looked like camille? - absolutely. the resemblance is uncanny. what did she model? spark plugs? - i happen to think she's very attractive. - you do?! - certainly. - do you think i'm attractive? you? of course not. you look like a giant half-chewed rubber-tipped pencil. well, think what the heck you like, because some people in this big old cosmos think i'm pretty amazing-looking, especially in the eye department, i thank you so very much. you're back. i heard. - ah, sir, meet camille. - hi. i'll go and prepare your quarters. the penthouse suite on a deck should suffice. well, this looks fine. if you remove your clothes, we'll begin the examination. sorry. dave lister, ship's surgeon. - you're a surgeon? - well, i'm not fully qualified, but i've seen every episode of ""st elsewhere"". if you like, we can dispense with the examination and go straight for the malpractice. so relax, and i'll turn on the laughing gas. giggles or guffaws? it's all the same to me. something tells me you're not a doctor. what gave it away? the fact that i've gone fully ten seconds without patronising you? this is weird. the last two humans in an infinite cosmos and we bump into each other. - yeah, it is weird, isn't it? - we have an awesome responsibility. - we do? - yeah. sure we do. to rebuild the human race... as quickly as possible. do you wanna start now or clean your teeth first? and they say romance is dead. the prospect of making love to a stranger is just as galling to me. we've got to be professional about this, totally clinical and unemotional. so just lie back and i'll slip into my spiderman costume. ah, listy. i see you've met our ravishing guest. - camille, have you seen kryten? - he went up to a deck. thanks muchly. oh, camille... it's just a silly thought, really, but i thought after you've settled in, we could pop up to the projection room and i could talk you through my photo collection of 20th-century telegraph poles. yeah, or if you fancy a more entertaining time, you can just let him shoot you through the head. as it happens, listy, camille is into telegraph poles as much as i am, especially the 1952 phase fours with the triple-reinforced wire. - what? you're into telegraph poles? - of course not. you see? and she's also a big fan of reggie wilson. - what? you like hammond organ music?! - it's mindless pap. absolutely amazing, eh? reggie wilson, telegraph poles... it's uncanny how much we've got in common. - are you ok, rimmer? - never better. where is he? a deck? ciao for now. - what was all that about? - what about? you were saying one thing and rimmer was hearing another. how do you do that? well, you'd probably have worked it out eventually. i'm a pleasure gelf. hey, what's going on, buddy? eraserhead says she's a mechanoid and captain sadness says she's a hologram. well, she's both and neither. she's a gelf. - gelf? - yeah. a genetically engineered life form. she's a pleasure gelf, created to be everyone's perfect companion. everyone perceives her differently. you see what you wanna see, what you most desire. are you telling me i'll see my perfect mate? mmm, yeah, and she'll fall instantly in love with you. what exquisite treasure of loveliness lies behind those doors? knowing you, a 6ft valkyrie warrior in scanty armour with a cleavage you can ski down. stop. you're making me dribble. well, here goes. hi, buddy. - you're me. - who else? - i'm the object of my own desire? - can you think of anyone more deserving? well, if you put it like that, i guess you're right. damn my vanity! ooow! - what did you see? - oh, just some gorgeous chunk of loveliness. - come on. - ooh, what a body! - what did you see? - my legs are still shaking. - cat, what did you see? - someone get me a brandy! well, i should've guessed. it was just too strange, actually meeting someone who didn't want to vomit over me in loathing and disgust. don't take it so personally, sir. we all feel foolish, used, chewed up and spat out. look, she didn't mean any harm. she can't control how we see her. she's... a mirror for our obsessions. - holly, what did you see? - nothing. i don't have any desires. either that, or me screen was foggy. i guess i owe you all an apology. sorry, dave. sorry, duke. - sorry, buddy. - heartbreaker! i told you it wouldn't work, kryten, if there were others. you're hurt the most. you're not used to these emotions. - why did you lie to me? - i felt something i'd never felt before. i knew if you saw the real me you'd be repelled. well, try me. turn away and i'll change to what i really am. i'm ready, - this is what i really look like, - oh. - what do you think? - well, i think you look... really nice. nice? she looks like something that dropped out of the sphinx's nose! he's right, i'm just a huge green blob, true, but as huge green blobs go, you're really cute. - i don't believe you, - ok, you'll never make the cover of ""vogue"", but, hey, neither will i. - i think you're really sweet. - you're lying, - i can't lie. i'm a mechanoid. - you really don't think i'm repulsive? of course not. there's some humans not as attractive as you. take karl malden, and he was a famous actor. you think this changes anything? camille, i'd be grateful if you joined me for dinner tonight. - you mean that? - parrot's bar. i'll meet you there at eight. flats or heels? i can't believe he's really going through with this. look, if kryten wants to take an amorphous green blob for a discreet tete-a-tentacle, - i say good luck to him. - me too. we all react differently. when steve mcqueen met the blob, he tried to kill it. he probably never thought of taking it to a restaurant. i know. they should go to a sushi bar. at least the food won't look better than his date. sir. i respect your sense of dress more than anything, and i'd really appreciate your opinion of this outfit. kryten, if i was going out with a ball of slime, that's how i'd dress. thank you, sir. that means a lot to me. well... don't wait up! - isn't this enchanting? - oh, kryten, - could we make it, you and i? - it's the old, old story. droid meets droid. droid becomes chameleon. droid loses chameleon. chameleon becomes blob. droid gets blob back again. - it's a classic tale. - a toast, my love, to us, ""the blue danube"") ""as time goes by"") ""casablanca. "" what a movie. i must have seen it a thousand times. lister used it as part of my course. it's littered with examples of how lying can be noble. from now on, my angel, ""casablanca"" will be our movie, and... sorry to gooseberry, kryten, but we've got a visitor. he wants to see camille. i was going to tell you, kryten, truly i was, - you have a husband?! - we're androgynous, but i suppose i do, hector has a brilliant mind, he's worked on an antidote for our condition for years, - hector's a blob too? - we're both blobs, kryten, i left him long ago, i thought he'd given up looking, - he must really thi nk a lot of you. - i guess, - what will you do? - i'll tell him i met someone else, i'm going to tell him i'm staying here with you, mr lister, would you take camille's bag on board? - certainly, kryten. anything you say. - why my bag, kryten? you're getting on that craft with hector where you belong. - no, kryten, - listen to me. do you know what you've got to look forward to here? - you're saying this to make me go, - you belong to hector. you're part of his work. if you don't get on that craft, you'll regret it, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life. - what about us? - we'll always have parrot's. - oh, kryten, - i'm no good at being noble, kid. the problems of two blobs and a droid don't amount to a hill of beans in this cosmos. are you ready, camille? i'm ready, goodbye, kryten, god bless you, - you were lying, kryten. - yes, but it was her best shot at happiness. it's the old, old story. droid meets droid. droid becomes chameleon. droid loses chameleon. chameleon turns into blob. droid gets blob back. blob meets blob. blob goes off with blob. droid loses blob, chameleon and droid. how many times have we seen that story? - i suppose you're gonna blame me. - yes, i am. without your bananas, movies and aardvarks, none of this could have happened. you're a complete and total smeghead. brutal, kryten. you just insulted me. yes. i can lie, cheat and be offensive now. kryten, this could be the start of a beautiful friendship. # it's cold outside, there's no kind of atmosphere # i'm all alone, more or less # let me fly far away from here # fun, fun, fun # in the sun, sun, sun # i want to lie shipwrecked and comatose # drinking fresh mango juice # goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes # fun, fun, fun # in the sun, sun, sun # fun, fun, fun # in the sun, sun, sun #"

(shrieks) toby, it's all right. mama's here. we'll take you home. you can look at your toy book. don't cry. we don't allow him to look at such things. it was only a magazine. there's nothing wrong with a magazine. we'll be the judge of what's right and wrong for our son. get his things. we're leaving. you can't just walk out. can't we? i feel sorry for the kid. anything we can do? i can look into the home situation. these aren't the dark ages. i expect i'll be seeing a lot of the ross family. we're home. everything will be fine now. you go play. be a good boy. what will we do? i know he saw it. he stared at it all the way down the block. what if he brings it? he has his toy book. he will forget. it was only a squirrel. it will be dead if it arrives. i will bury it in the backyard like i always do. please, remember your heart. you know i worry. ernest, that woman-- miss kemp... she won't bother us. i'll take care of it. mary, please. he's a good boy, ernest. he just doesn't understand. maybe that woman is right. maybe a class... some kind of a special teacher... mary. just a little help. just for a few days. just a couple of hours. that's not wrong of me, is it? for just... just a few hours. maybe we could... we could go to dinner to a nice restaurant. just the two of us. maybe we could go to a movie. how long has it been since we've seen a movie? i know you're tired. it would be nice to have someone share the burden, but we can't, mary. we can't. he's ours. our son. our responsibility. if we leave him alone for just a few hours, there's no telling what sort of things he might see... or what he might bring. bring. mary. i made you some tea. how nice. you didn't need to do that. where's toby? still in his room, playing or sleeping. he's fine. try not to worry. you know i can't help it. i'll just peek in and see if he's all right. i'll be right back. toby? toby? toby? toby, what are you...? ernest: mary? mar... mar... mary! (doorbell) i hope i'm not disturbing you, mr. ross. i'm so sorry about your wife. oh, yes. well, thank you. thank you. mary. she was so very tired. she was never a very strong woman, and all the stress... hello, toby. toby. you've come about toby, of course. i don't mean to intrude on your grief, mr. ross, but i believe you need my help with your wife gone. i've brought some literature you may want to take a look at. you want to put him in an institution? pictures! it's very nice. i won't... send toby away. ernest: now, if you're done, i'm not done. i've done some investigating since the last time we spoke. i've talked to your neighbors and former employer and your wife's family. unless you'll listen to reason, i have grounds to remove toby from your custody. i see. how you treat him is appalling-- almost medieval. your neighbors say he is a virtual you never take him outside-- not even for walks. you've boarded up the windows of this house. you don't allow him to play with other children. you don't take him to the park or the zoo. your wife's sister says you don't even allow him the meager solace of a television. no. no, we don't. it's all right, toby. (whimpering) she won't hurt you. no, i think you've hurt him enough. sit down, miss kemp. don't say another word. sit down. you want to take toby from me? then maybe it's time you knew something about him. dad... boo... boo... book! toby. toby, toby! boy loves books-- photo books, comics, magazines, anything with pictures in it. toby... come, toby. come to papa. come here. bring for papa. bring it here. bring... bring, bring, toby. bring. ernest: sharp! no, no, no. sharp. there are a lot of sharp things a lot of dangerous things. do you understand? i'm trying to talk to you about your son's future, and you're doing parlor tricks. prove it to yourself. go on. all right, toby. bring this. mr. ross, this is not... bring! (screams) what is this, mr. ross? some kind of... a miracle? a miracle? no, miss kemp. it's more like a curse. why do you say that, mr. ross? this boy has a gift! he has a talent nobody else has ever had. he saw a puppy on television one day before we got rid of the set. he wanted it so he brought it. it was dead when it arrived. he can bring back living things, but he forgets. our back yard is full of what i've buried there. do you still want to take him to the zoo? do you still think he needs to play with other children? most of the time, he needs a picture. now sometimes toby just remembers. i owe you an apology. toby was never the prisoner. it was us-- mary and me. all right, mr. ross, listen to me. it doesn't have to be that way. toby still needs help. he needs it now more than ever. you know what kind of help the world they'll lock him up-- run their tests and experiments-- use him if they could for whatever they want. toby won't say no. he can't say no. when they're finished with him, what will the life of one little retarded boy be worth? he is my son, and this is his home. get out! out! get out! get out! i can't leave and forget this. get out! i have to report... no, toby, don't. mama. toby! bring! no, toby! toby, don't look. don't look. that's not mama. that's not mama. i'll take it away. i'll take it away. i'll take it out. i'll get rid of it. it's all right. it's all right. i'm sorry, mary... the picture... he doesn't understand. it was my fault. i never should have...

you! where's the butcher? ma'am, i don't know, ma'am. his duffel bag arrived. it's not a duffel bag. it's my apartment! hubert, meet john zoidberg. you need an alien hacked to pieces, he's the best there is... in the budget category. have you ever dissected a yeti before?

sometimes you pull one and... you don't know what you're doing! i want my back back! hmm. what started out as a pleasant afternoon of drugs and surgery has not gone as planned. but don't worry, we still have three or four co-workers with plenty of spare parts. my first mission. i'm so excited. and after i dissect the yeti's poison glands, we can stop, maybe, for ice cream on the way back? with shprinkles on? why, you're just a big kid, aren't you, zoidberg? a very big kid. we're over the drop zone, gentlemen. might i suggest you jump out the door and poop yourselves? so anyway, i hope the men have been taking their hypermalaria pills. their wha...? their ""wha...""? that's funny, like a crazy old man. but you know what's not funny? deadly tritonian hypermalaria. just be sure to stay out of the methane swamps. what smells like methane? my god. i've never seen such a gruesome shark attack. especially this far inland. it wasn't a shark. it was an awful, incompetent doctor. wow, he must've been a total zoidberg. it was zoidberg. he brutalized us with power tools, gypsy curses and hypnosis. yes, master. you'll all get through this. i give you my word as a real doctor. what about me? what did he do to you? i don't know exactly, but i'm incontinent. i'm truly sorry. i consider myself a reasonable man. quick with a joke, slow to anger. but bender can't go on long car trips anymore, and i say zoidberg must die. people, please. let's not overreact. death to the crab. how bad is it, doctor? super bad. it's tritonian hypermalaria. a lot of these men will be dead within 24 hours. what?! not you, though. you'll make a complete recovery and go on to marry a supermodel! funny plague, hypermalaria. it can kill immediately, or lie dormant for decades. but sooner or later, it erupts, causing fever, spasms, madness, coma, and finally death. what?! supermodel! oh, those poor, doomed bastards. i guess it's up to me to complete the mission. i'll be in the swamp, blowing the smirk off a toxic yeti. professor, we need to talk, man-to-mob. we've had it with zoidberg! we demand you fire him! nonsense. zoidberg's a fine physician, for aliens. your mistake is being humans. no, if i'm going to fire anyone, it'll be scruffy. you can't do that! over my dead body! don't you get it, old man? thanks to dr. scissorhands, i wet myself every time i laugh. it's not funny! well, i guess it is kind of funny. uh-oh. why are you protecting zoidberg, professor? do you owe him something? is he blackmailing you somehow? what does he have on you? why have you kept him around all these years when he's so grossly incompetent? long ago, zoidberg and i entered into a secret arrangement relating to certain extraordinary events too horrible to reveal. so there's nothing to be curious about. stop, or i'll shoot! zoidberg? you can't hunt a yeti by yourself, sir. it's suicidal! so what? i'm going to die of hypermalaria, anyway. i was in the same swamp as the rest of the men. just because you were in the swamp doesn't necessarily mean... i was thirsty from the flight. i drank swamp water. look, zoidberg, you're a loyal friend. ""friend""? but i'm doomed. i might as well capture a yeti and die trying. then you'll need someone to dissect it, friend. go, johnny! go! that's an order! never! zoidberg doesn't abandon a friend, apparently. oh. oh-oh-oh... i'll save us by scaring him off with my crazy war noise. crunch all you want. i'll make more. oy, i lost another one. zoidberg, i'm sorry to break it to you this way, but we hate you and we never want to see you again. but friends... we're not your friends! we're your victims! i was just trying to... shut up and give me my kidney back! i'm sorry. i'm sorry. we don't know why the professor keeps you around here, and we don't care. you're a terrible doctor! nobody wants to see you ever again! dr. zoidberg! i want to see you right now! the time has come, my friend. we have to talk about our arrangement. oh, no. no, no. oh, no, no, no! oh, no! oh, no! unpaw him, you big ape! i saw this in a tarzan movie! it was called... tarzan versus the yetis. i lost my virginity during the film, so i'm... a little fuzzy on the details. john, are you all right? you... you saved my life! - oh, fuff. - yes, fuff. how can i ever repay you? do you need a slave? or maybe a butler? no, i haven't needed a butler since grad school. but i do need a doctor. i don't want to die like those marines, john. the fever, the madness. don't forget the spasms, coma and death. oh, i don't want to go through that. i want you to kill me. all right. give me the knife. not now! hypermalaria can lie dormant for years. isn't that what you said? it sounds like something i would say. so stay with me until the symptoms start, then put me out of my misery. you must swear! all right, hubert, i swear. it's started, zoidberg... the fever, the muscle spasms. i'm dying. it's time for you to keep your promise and kill me. this is very difficult, but i'll try, friend. no, wait, i'm afraid to die. ugh, you said you wanted me to kill you. is this one of those ""no means yes"" deals? yes and no. i do want you to kill me, but i mustn't see it coming. that would be agony. so you must murder me completely by surprise. as god is my witness, you can count on me. well, see you tomorrow. not surprising enough. wha...? oh... my... heart. hey. what are you doing there? whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. stop, you don't understand. let's go, you murderer. fry, help me lock him up. hang on, i'm learning how to do loop-de-loops. whoa, whoa, whoo! you're making a mistake. i was only trying to kill the professor. hubert, i'm sorry. huh? he doesn't have hair. great little caesar's ghost. you fools, you stupid, life-prolonging fools. i asked zoidberg to kill me. huh? what? what you talkin' 'bout, professor? professor, have you gone mad? probably. it's one of the symptoms of tritonian hypermalaria. you mean the incurable disease that causes fever, spasms, insanity... ...coma... ...and finally death? yes, and i begged zoidberg to put me out of my misery. bring him... quickly. should have known better than to store my antiques in the office. zoidberg, we were wrong. we're letting you out so you can kill the professor. oh, no, he sand-crabbed out. then we have no choice. we'll have to mercy-kill the professor ourselves. well, let's get started. we have a situation, mother. this creature tried to sand-crab into the building. zoidberg? sorry i didn't call first, carol, but i'm in a hurry. i need your help to save hubert. let him go and stooge the hell out of here. we're on it. ow. ow! ow! beautiful kids. you must be very proud. john zoidberg. it's been a long time. how have you been? not too bad. last year i took a bus trip to the grand canyon. later i'll show you the pictures. do you ever regret it, john, leaving me to work for the professor? what do you want me to say? he saved my life. oh, big deal. you could have been rich if you'd stayed. your own lab, a full staff. but hubert is my friend. he's very sick. i can cure him, but i need the thing, the thing from triton. it'll cost you, john. how much are you worth now? i live in a dumpster. all i have in the world is this coupon for one free session at the tanning salon. oh, john, that's really all you have? then i'll take it. okay, murdolator's finished. i said i'd kill him myself, but nobody listens to bender. we all have to share in the guilt, which is why we're each going to add one drop of cyanide to the death wheel as it goes by. commence mercy-killing in three, two, a-yup. kill-check one is go. kill-check two is go. it's about time. vegetables activated. kill-check three is go. also, the salad's ready. what the hell are you doing? zoidberg, we know about your secret agreement. i am so, so sorry for how we treated you. and to make it up to you, we're killing the professor for you so he doesn't die horribly from hypermalaria. he doesn't have hypermalaria, you idiots. he has yeti-ism. when he saved my life all those years ago, he was scratched by a yeti. hmm, i consider myself almost completely ignorant of modern medicine, and i've never heard of yeti-ism. it mimics the symptoms of hypermalaria exactly, except for the part where instead of dying, you turn into a yeti. aah. wow. hold him down while i prepare the antidote. another yeti? yes, the same jerk that once noshed on me like a shrimp toast. now who's getting his pineal gland extracted? ah, yes, this contains a concentrated form of the yeti neurotoxin. but that's what gave him yeti-ism in the first place. won't it just make him a double-yeti? don't lecture me about alien physiology, conrad. the pineal neurotoxin neutralizes the adrenal neurotoxin. that's why yetis don't drive themselves mad. my god, he's like some kind of believable hulk. no time for an injection. i'll be damned, it did make him a double-yeti. it wasn't supposed to do any of those things. you did it, johnny. i'm cured. all right, let's set it up and try again. there's one thing i don't understand, zoidberg. how did you persuade mom to give you her precious yeti head? did you have to promise anything in return? nothing, nothing at all. this calls for a celebration. come on, everyone, let's go tanning! i was going to tan... ...once what do you say, johnny? it's on me. thank you, hubert."
1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"good evening. you should have seen the one that got away. the only one ive ever seen with gold lamy scales. im sure all of you are interested in the details of this catch. it's really a matter of finding the proper bait. i soon learned that these little creatures can tell, cheap costume jewelry on site and won't come near it. you must bait your hook with the real article. and sometimes they make off with the bait before you can reel them in. however, that's a situation with which most of you men are already familiar. tonight's fable is entitled the last escape. but first something from which there is no escape. the last escpae -ok, are you ready mr ferlini?

okay how do you want to work the act? i expand they timing i relax the rope falls off. i got a skeleton key in a seam of the pants. as soon as i get the handcuffs off i reach into the pants, get out a razor blade cut myself out of the sack, get out of the false bottom of the trunk, and go to the surface of the lake like a cork. -it's a cinch. -yeah how good a swimmer are you? the greatest you don't have to worry about that. when i was a kid i was gonna swim the english channel. that's how good i was. well i could put you over in a motorboat, pick you up the same way, that'd lessen the risk. that'd be easy. i know you'd see it. well i don't see it. sounds to me like a ticket to the graveyard. why? you're wrong, honey. this is a ticket to the big time, right harry? maybe, we'll have to see. -tell me what are you doing here? -well i had to see you. -i thought i don't... i know joe isn't here. i saw him swimming in the lake. what's all this swimming about anyway he's taking it awfully seriously. he's getting in shape. -he's going for a long swim. -what? tommy you shouldn't be here. -you don't want any trouble neither do i. -i didn't come here for trouble. what did you come here for? i didn't think i had to tell you. wonder you've got to leave him. it's getting worse all the time. you don't know what it's like. every year, every day. all he thinks about night and day is the act. escape, escape, escape, sometimes i think im going crazy tommy i mean it. when we were in louisville last year i went to, a headshrinker for a while. do you know that? three months it was. and he got that job in vegas. that was the end of that. ask me, he's the one that's crazy treating you the way he does. no he thinks about escaping in his sleep sometimes. no kidding. sometimes in the middle of the night he throws off the covers and takes a bath. -tommy? -yeah? -would you do me a favor? -certainly. would you put these on? please. try it to get loose. -i can't. -of course you can't. neither could joe. if he didn't have this hidden on him someplace. now try it. -the key, it won't turn. -no of course it won't. it's the wrong key. this is the right one. you know that water trick he does where? -he gets thrown into the lake. -yes. well he's gonna do it in a couple of weeks. that's what he's practicing for now. and you know what ive been hoping and praying for ever since he decided to do it. you better go now. in casey he comes back. sure everything's all set i don't want anything to go wrong. im always all set. -you sure you feel okay, huh? -never better. have a little kiss, honey, for good lu.ck yeah sure, joe. chief wallace, id like you to meet the great ferlini. -fellini. -this is mr ralph kremens president of the local chamber of commerce. frank petty of the tribune. and you've already met our motorboat pilot mr dave brooks. well let's get started it's a bit warm and im ready for a dip. -chief wallace do you have the handcuffs? -yes i have them right here. now chief wallace you've examined these handcuffs are you sure they're genuine. -oh they're genuine all right. -and will you place them on please. -yeah. -may we have the rope please? now will you gentlemen tie this rope around the body, of the great ferlini and make as many knots as you wish. i warn you mr ferlini, i used to be a boy scout. there. now mrs ferlini may i have the sack please. our gentleman lift the great ferlini onto the sack please. now pull the sack up over his head. and fasten the top securely. and now... we have the trunk. now you gentlemen have examined this trunk and tested its locks, is that correct? the lock is okay but why do you have all these holes in the trunk? a good question. the holes are there to make the trunk sink faster. -satisfied? -okay. -all right. will you gentlemen lift the great ferlini into the trunk please? chief wallace. chief wallace will you secure the lock, please? well now are you gentlemen satisfied that the, great ferlini is securely locked in this trunk? -we are. -sure. -and we are ready to put him aboard the motorboat. i sure hope they know what they're doing. -is this all right mr miller? -yes this'll do fine. all right dave let's get this trunk overboard. yes sir. there he goes. he's not coming up mr miller. he's got to come up. he's got to. he's not coming up. dear friends we are gathered here today, to consign the mortal remains of joseph, martin ferlini to the earth which bore him. who can say that joseph ferlini, in his last moment of earthly glory was not happy? in this choice which was made for him, by the almighty arbiter of life and death. is this a ferlini funeral? why yes. -but im sorry to break this up reverend but, im from the uh county coroner's office. im afraid the funeral services can't continue. we have orders to attach the body of joseph ferlini. -but surely... -what's the matter? something wrong? -im sorry ma'am, you mrs ferlini? -yes. but we have a court order to attach your husband's body, the coroner wanted me to make a further examination. im afraid ill have to open the coffin. -open the coffin? -yes, at the caretakers cottage. we'll make the examination there. would you gentlemen please pick up the coffin and uh follow me? thank you gentlemen ill call you when i need you. im sorry uh you must go. don't look on there. well you got to understand how it is in my business. everything is showmanship, everything. and that's why ferlini made this deal with me. and just what was this deal? well nobody knew about it but him and me. it was crazy, i told him that. but he made me promise him that if anything ever happened to him, if he should die that i would arrange a last escape. something that would make him be remembered longer even than houdini. -and that's all it was a trick. -a trick? look, i slipped the undertaker 50 bucks and he, arranged to have him buried someplace secretly. then he put an empty coffin under the hearse and that guy from, the coroner's office he was a phony too just an actor i hired. so, you see what i mean? showmanship. i see, but im afraid that your showmanship, has had quite an effect on mrs ferlini. -that's the unfortunate part. -yeah. well i feel pretty rotten about that, doctor. -could i see her? -im sorry mr miller but that's impossible right now. yeah well i understand. well remember doctor if there's anything i can do... thank you mr miller, thank you. mrs ferlini i really would try and rest if i were you. you must remember that things are always much better than they seem. that this is the best of all possible worlds. that every cloud has a silver lining. and that it is darkest just before the dawn. i tell you this not because of what you have just experienced. but for what you are about to see. i suppose you're wondering what became of my catch. the game warden insisted i throw her back in. because her measurements didn't meet specifications. in order to keep them they must be larger than 36 22 15. and of course it's quite difficult knowing, precisely where to take that last measurements. next week i should be back so let us hope i have some more luck in the meantime. until then, good night."
1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"good evening, ladies and gentlemen. a special word to those of you who have been arrested while speeding home to see this show. i can do nothing to bail you out. and i'm afraid the magistrate is only slightly in my debt. i shall, however, do everything i can to make you forget your troubles. tonight's narrative is about gangsters. and i thought i'd best test some of the props. i would like to play the flight of the bumblebee. but we must get on with the show. uh... king? yes? cutter's here again. well, have him come in. honest, boss, is that jerk really an eye? he's one of the best in town. he just don't look bright enough to tail anybody. look, if i want your ideas, i'll ask for them. in the meantime, tell him to come in. okay, boss. come on in. how do you do, mr. koster? hello, cutter. well, it certainly is a nice day. sit down, please. thank you. my assistant outside thinks you're the kind of man who isn't bright enough to make a good detective. me? i disagree. thank you, mr. koster. you're an insignificant runt. yes, indeed i am. why, you're like a bug in a patch of grass. no one would look at you twice. absolutely. it helps me in my job. all right, bug. what'd you find out on this job? this is my first report. let's see it. oh, it isn't typed out. i'll have to read it to you. my handwriting isn't very good. go ahead. shoot. ""july 12th. ""trailed woman to the zoo. in the birdhouse... "" birdhouse? she seems to like birds of paradise. yeah. she likes birds, all right. all kinds. go on. ""in front of a cage, she again met the same man ""as she did yesterday in the bar. ""about 30. looks like a young professor or executive. ""dressed conservatively, in a dark suit... "" all right. skip the coat and tie and come to the point. ""followed couple out of the zoo to taxi stand. ""woman got into cab and drove away. ""trailed man to hotel lobby, ""but lost him in convention crowd. "" this same man has now been seen half a dozen times doesn't prove my wife's cheating on me. it's just what the law calls circumstantial evidence. true enough, but... why shouldn't a woman half my age have a man you think i can't face the truth, huh? mine is an extremely cynical profession, we always assume the worst. it's refreshing to find a husband who refuses to make two and two now, look, cutter... now, you needn't try to convince me. what if she has met this man? what does it prove? they went to the zoo a couple of times? so, she likes birds. what if he did buy her a drink a couple of times? so, she likes a cocktail. she didn't want to tell me about it, isn't it? yes. who is he? what's his name? what does he do for a living? well, i wasn't able to find out yesterday but believe me, i'll get a line on him oh, you do want me to follow up, don't you? of course. day and night. good. oh. i'm sorry. come in, marian. meet mr. cutter. how do you do, mr. cutter? it's a pleasure, mrs. koster. well, goodbye. who was that? oh, that's one of my accountants. he's doing the books. oh, well, i hope i'm not interrupting anything. of course not. you know i'm always happy when you drop in. i was just in the neighborhood and i wanted to ask you... yes? well, you remember claire bigelow? she was my dearest friend when we were in show business together. yes, i remember. she married that car dealer yes. well, she's been very lonely since he died... i didn't know he was dead. when did it happen? oh, i thought i'd told you. two months ago. so, she called me this morning and asked me if i'd come and visit her for the weekend. i said i'd ask you. well, how long will you be away? oh, just a couple of days. but if you don't want me to go, dear... no, it's all right. have enough money for the trip? yes, plenty. thank you. aren't you going to kiss me goodbye? i'm only going to be away for two days, dear. louis, not so rough. my hat. it cost you $85. have i paid for it yet? yes. goodbye, dear. bye. have a good time in cleveland. baldy? yeah? come in here. what is it? pass the word along. i want harry silver harry silver? yes, harry silver, you dumb ox! sure, but... but what? but you've never given a job to anybody as big as him. who said i had a job for him? don't you? maybe, maybe not. but if i do, i want the best killer in the business. how've you been, harry? not bad, king, not bad at all. haven't seen you for a couple of years. here, there. what's on your mind, king? i might have a job for you. don't your own boys carry guns anymore? i know this could be a very special job. i wouldn't trust those morons it would have to be special if you'd be willing oh, i'd pay. would you? i don't work very often these days. but when i do, i come high. i'll pay you $10,000. it may go higher. what do you mean? 10,000 is a lot of money. and to me, this is worth... i'm not interested in what it's worth to you. i'm interested in the job. i fix my fee accordingly. it may be more than 10,000 or maybe less. i can tell better after i hear what it is. more than 10,000? sure, if i think it's worth it. so tell me the story and i'll quote you my fee. like a doctor with an operation. so much for an appendix, so much for an amputation. it'll be a ""take it or leave it"" because i never bargain. if you say, ""harry, it's no,"" that's okay by me. well, i understand your setup, there is no job yet. you mean, this is just a little yes. kind of. you see, i'm not certain yet that i want anything done. well, that's not like you, king. you usually know who's doing the dealing and how the cards are coming up. usually, yes. well, how come this time you goofed? look, harry, let's cut out this shoptalk, shall we? let's have a drink. all right. for all i know, there won't be anything for you to do. so, let's just have a friendly little chat, shall we? fine. you're looking good, king. kept your weight down. i go to the gym a lot. over the rocks? yeah. see any of our old friends lately? no, not since i got into real estate, etcetera. so, you're a legitimate businessman. mmm-hmm. yes, now i'm legitimate. since i last saw you, harry, i got married. heard about it in detroit. my wife's 25 years old. oh? yes. i'm twice her age. that could be good or that could be bad. i've given her everything. you were always generous with young chicks. i made a will and left her all i have. the house, the stocks, the money in the bank. it isn't peanuts, harry. it's millions. she can have anything she wants in the world. except one thing. another man. i'm ahead of you now. well, don't be. it might be just a false alarm. you see, it's a matter of geography. what do you mean? you know a detective named cutter? no, i don't think so. well, it all depends on whether or not and if he's not in cleveland? then, i'll have a job for you. painful or quiet? that's up to you. you see, it's a guy and a dame. both? both. i hope that cutter went to cleveland. so do i. you know, king, if by any chance the fee is going to be higher than you want to pay. wait a minute. what do you mean? don't get upset. well, why are you boosting your prices on me? because i don't like killing women. and then, for doing the job on two people, that means a knife, no noise. all together, for old times sake, i'll let you have both of them dead oh? what do you call a bargain? 20,000. now i have another reason for hoping cutter doesn't have bad news for me. let's hope. you know where to reach me, king. yes. so long. so long, harry. go on. mr. koster? yes? i did what you told me. well, what took you so long? she's been home since noon. mr. koster, your wife's girlfriend's husband... all right, let's have it straight. well, he isn't dead. and your wife didn't go to cleveland. all right. let's have the details. well, they aren't pleasant details, mr. koster. what happened? let's have it! she met the same man in a bar on carroll street. i sat in a booth behind them. may i read what they said to each other? i pride myself on total recall. what i am about to read to you is their exact conversation. all right. spill it! your wife: ""where will we go?"" the man: ""anywhere, so long as you are with me, princess. "" your wife: ""i love the word 'princess' the man: ""but you are a princess, what's the matter with this fellow? well, he is that kind of a man. poetic. poetic? go on. your wife moved closer to him. and now the man says, ""shelley expressed my feeling ""better than i can ever hope to. "" who's this shelley character? well, he's a famous english poet. oh. well, lucky for him. go on. so the man quoted to your wife, ""'the fountains mingle with the rivers, ""'the rivers mingle with the oceans... ""' all right. that's enough of that stuff. then the man says, ""am i never to learn then your wife says, ""let's not start she called him ""darling""? the man: ""i'm only human. i've a natural curiosity. ""you walk into my arms out of the blue ""like some goddess from a greek myth. "" is this fellow a greek? no. he's just being poetical again. shall i go on? the man: ""why can't i ever know your wife: ""if i told you my name, ""because my father's name is famous. "" her old man wasn't famous. he was a junk peddler. well, your wife was lying. i think that she meant you because... well, you are famous. and i'm old enough to be her father, go on, say it! your wife: ""now stop asking questions ""and take me somewhere where we can be alone. "" all right. what's his name? well, he rented a car under the name of kenneth jones, from my experience, i'd say that he's a teacher at the state college or something like that. but don't worry, i'll get his name the next time. there won't be a next time. i'll take care of the professor myself. here's your fee. there's a $50 tip. now, drop the case. i don't understand. i said, ""drop the case. "" aren't you satisfied with my work? yes, you did fine. i just don't need you anymore, that's all. goodbye. goodbye, mr. koster. let me talk to harry silver. harry? king. yeah. i'll pay that 20,000. oh, hello, mr. silver. yes, he's waiting for you. go right in. i ordered this last week to surprise my wife. birds are stupid. yes. well, i got the report. what's the story? guilty. tough. looks like you're stuck with yeah. when do you want me to go to work? tonight. where will i find them? i have one of my boys tailing them right now. wait a minute. yes? here? wait downstairs for her. yes. that was my boy now. it seems my wife's paying me a little visit. i'd better go. no. sit down. i want you to meet her, so that you know that you have the right woman. maybe cutter was wrong. no, cutter wasn't wrong. i was wrong. i was wrong to trust that... louis, darling, i... oh. baldy didn't tell me you were busy. i'm sorry. it's all right. come in, honey. i want you to meet an old friend of mine. harry, my wife. how do you do, mr. silver? i'm very glad to meet you. louis, what beautiful birds. you like them? oh, they're lovely. i love birds. what are you doing with them? i got them for baldy's kid. oh. what's on your mind, honey? well... i'll wait outside. no, mr. silver, please stay. i'll only be a minute. darling, i was feeling a little blue, so i thought i might buy myself something nice. something extra special. like what? promise not to scold me? buy what? you know that little red sports car, the one we saw? i remember. well, i know it's awfully expensive, but... it's too expensive. oh? it's not like going out and buying a new hat. i'm sorry. that's all right. just don't buy it. i got you a new car only a few months ago. sure. he's really the most generous husband in the world. you're right. it was just an idea. goodbye, honey. bye. goodbye, mr. silver. oh, goodbye. no wonder you're crazy about her. she's beautiful. most beautiful thing in the world. harry. yeah? i can't let you kill her. you've gotten chicken. i'm crazy about her. can't blame you. i couldn't live without her, no matter what she does. you don't care if i change my mind, do you? no. i'd hate to take something as warm as that and turn her into something cold and dead. she's all i have. what about the guy? let him have it. where would i find him? i'll know by tonight. i'll call you. okay. harry? yeah? that brings it down to 10,000? yeah. 10,000. well, so long, king. so long. and thanks. this is louis koster. who's this? look, that red sports car in the window, i want it. well, how much if i pay cash? that's all right. yeah, send the papers over to my office and drive the car to my home. yes. good. sorry to disturb you, king. but i came back to say that i've changed my mind. about what? i'm not gonna do it. what do you mean? i'm not gonna kill that guy. why not? i'm just not in the mood to kill myself. not in the mood? what are you talking about? it's like the way you see a woman i don't follow you, harry. it's simple. you just don't appreciate the wonders of a woman. the way she's put together, the way she can love and hate. you think that you can own a woman with money. well, it's not enough. you just never learned the secrets ""she walks in beauty, like the night ""of cloudless climes and starry skies. "" so, you like poetry, too, huh? you wouldn't understand, king. the only two things that a man should die for or live for are a poem or a woman like marian. marian? you shouldn't have told me that you left everything because instead of just $20,000, i'm going to marry a rich widow who loves me. don't try to reach baldy. he's outside with a broken neck. no charge. listen, harry... once, centuries ago, there was a french hoodlum called francois villon. he was just like me. a no-good crook and a killer. but whenever he was in love, he'd turn into a poet. he wrote some great things. just listen to this, king. ""when death, that cheater of cheats, ""and his voice grows near, ""where are the snows of yesteryear?"" do you like that, king? yeah. good. now i think i'll kill you. to summarize the next reel, harry did as he threatened, and marian lived happily ever after. she had a rich, full life. it was too bad harry was not there to share it with her, but, of course, crime does not pay, murder will out, etcetera, etcetera. and now, good night until we again bring you a saga of suspense and or mystery. good night."
1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"mr. magnussen, please state your full name for the record. charles augustus magnussen. mr. magnussen, how would you describe your influence over the prime minister? the british prime minister? any of the british prime ministers you have known. i never had the slightest influence over any of them. why would i? i notice you've had seven meetings at downing street this year. why? because i was invited. can you recall the subjects under discussion? not without being more indiscreet than i believe is appropriate. do you think it right that a newspaper proprietor, a private individual, and in fact a foreign national, should have such regular access to our prime minister? i don't think it's wrong that a private individual should accept an invitation. however, you have my sincere apologies for being foreign. that's not what i meant. that is not in any way... mr. magnussen, can you recall an occasion when your remarks could have influenced government policy? or the prime minister's thinking in any way? no. are you sure? i have an excellent memory. (projector whirs) your car is waiting outside... see you tomorrow. may i join you? i don't think it's appropriate. it isn't. mr. magnussen, outside the inquiry, we can have no contact, no communication at all. please don't do that. in 1982, your husband corresponded with helen catherine driscoll. that was before i knew him. the letters were lively, loving... some would say explicit. and currently in my possession. will you please move your hand? ""i long, my darling, to know the touch of your... body."" i know what was in the letters. she was 15. she looked older. oh, she looked delicious. we have photographs too. the ones she sent him. yum-yum. he was unaware of her age. he met her only once before the letters began. when he discovered the truth, he stopped immediately. those are the facts. facts are for history books. i work in news. your hand is sweating. always, i'm afraid. i have a condition. it's disgusting. i'm used to it. the whole world is wet to my touch. i will call someone, i will have you removed. what is that? claire de la lune? a bit young for you, isn't it? you want to hit me now? could you, still? little old lady now. perhaps you should settle for calling someone. well, go on. no? because now there are consequences. i have the letters and therefore i have you. this is blackmail. of course it isn't blackmail. this is... ownership. you do not own me. claire de la lune. it never tastes like it smells, does it? lady smallwood's bill is on me. see to it. yes, mr. magnussen. (she shudders) oh, god! oh! you all right, ma'am? fine, yes. magnussen! no-one stands up to him. no-one dares, no-one even tries. there isn't a man or woman in england capable of stopping that disgusting creature... ma'am? turn the car around. we're going back into town. turn around. where are we going, ma'am? baker street. (rapid gunfire and explosions) you've seen a lot of injuries, then? violent deaths?' 'enough for a lifetime. want to see some more?' oh, god, yes. (knocking on door) the game is on. (knocking continues) i know it's early. really, i'm sorry. (woman sobs) is that kate? yeah, it's kate. invite her in? er, sorry, yes, do you want to come in, kate? hey! it's hard. there you go. it's isaac. oh, your husband? son. son, yeah. he's gone missing again. didn't come home last night. the usual. he's the drugs one, yeah? er, yeah, nicely put, john. but is it sherlock holmes you want? because i've not seen him in ages. about a month. who is sherlock holmes? see, that does happen. there's a place they all go to, him and his friends. they all do whatever they do. shoot up, whatever you call it. where is he? it's a house, it's a dump. it's practically falling down. no, the address? where, exactly? seriously? why not? she's not going to the police, someone's got to get him. why you? i'm being neighbourly. since when? ha, since now. since this exact minute. why are you being so...? what? i don't know, what's the matter with you? there is nothing the matter with me. imagine i said that without shouting. i'm trying. no, you can't come, you're pregnant. you can't go, i'm pregnant! (she chuckles) what is that?! it's a tyre lever. why? cos there were loads of smackheads in there and one of them might need help with a tyre. if there's any trouble, just go, i'll be fine. john, john, john, john... it is a tiny bit sexy. yeah, i know. (john bangs on door) hello? what do you want? excuse me. (door crashes open) oh, no, you can't come in here! i'm looking for a friend. a very specific... friend. i'm not just browsing. you've got to go. no-one's allowed here. (he clears his throat) isaac whitney, you seen him? i'm asking you if you've seen isaac whitney and now you're showing me a knife. is it a clue? are you doing a mime? go. or i'll cut you. oh, not from there. let me help. now, concentrate. isaac... whitney? okay, you asked for it. (man grunts in pain) agh! ohh! right. are you concentrating yet? you broke my arm! no, i sprained it. it feels squishy. is it supposed to feel squishy? feel that! yeah, it's a sprain. i'm a doctor, i know how to sprain people. now where is isaac whitney? i don't know! maybe upstairs. there you go. wasn't that easy? no, it was really sore. mental, you are! no, just used to a better class of criminal. (bird cawing) (man coughing) isaac? isaac whitney? (object clatters) isaac? (man responds weakly) hello, mate. sit up for me, sit up. dr watson? yep. where am i? arse-end of the universe with the scum of the earth. look at me. have you come for me? do you think i know a lot of people here? hey, all right? sherlock: oh, hello, john. didn't expect to see you here. come for me too? hello, isaac. mrs. watson, can i, can i get in, please? yes, of course, get in. where's john? they're having a fight. who is?! (door clatters) for god sakes, john, i'm on a case! a month. that's all it took. one! i'm working. ""sherlock holmes in a drug den."" how's that going to look?! i'm undercover. no, you're not! (car tyres screech) well, i'm not now! in, both of you, quickly! please, can i come? i think i've got a broken arm. no, go away. no, let him. why? yeah, just get in. it's a sprain. anyone else? i mean, are we taking everybody home, are we? all right, shezza? ""shezza""? i was undercover! seriously, shezza, though? we're not going home, we're going to bart's. i'm calling molly. why? because sherlock holmes needs to pee in a jar. well? is he clean? clean? how dare you throw away the beautiful gifts you were born with! and how dare you betray the love of your friends! say you're sorry. sorry your engagement's over. though i'm fairly grateful for the lack of a ring. stop it. just stop it! if you were anywhere near this kind of thing again, you could have called, you could have talked to me. please, do relax. this is all for a case. what kind of case would need you doing this? i might as well ask you why you've started cycling to work? no, we're not playing this game. quite recently, i'd say, you're very determined about it. not interested. i am. ow! oh, sorry, you moved, but it is just a sprain. yeah, somebody hit me. huh? yeah, just some guy. yeah, it was probably just an addict in need of a fix. yes, i think in a way it was. is it his shirt? i'm sorry? well, it's the creases, isn't it? the two creases down the front. it's been recently folded, but it's not new. you must have dressed in a hurry this morning. so all your shirts must be kept like that. but why? maybe cos you cycle to work every morning, shower when you get there and then dress in the clothes you brought with you. you keep your shirts folded, ready to pack. not bad. and i further deduce... ...you've only started recently because you've got a bit of chafing. no, he's always walked like that. remind me, what's your name again? they call me the wig. no, they don't. well, they... they call me wiggy. nope. bill. bill wiggins. nice observational skills, billy. (text alert) ah, finally! finally what? good news? oh, excellent news, the best. there's every chance that my drug habit might hit the newspapers. the game is on. excuse me... for a second. you've heard of charles augustus magnussen, of course? yeah. owns some newspapers. ones i don't read. hang on, weren't there other people? mary's taking the boys home, i'm taking you, we did discuss it. people were talking, none of them were me, i must have filtered. i noticed. i have to filter out a lot of witless babble. i've got mrs. hudson on semi-permanent mute. (he sighs) what is my brother doing here? so i'll just pay, then, shall i? he's straightened the knocker. he always corrects it, it's ocd, doesn't even know he's doing it. why do you do that? do what? nothing. well then, sherlock, back on the sauce? what are you doing here? i phoned him. the siren call of old habits. how very like uncle rudy. though in many ways, cross-dressing would have been a wiser path for you. you phoned him. of course i bloody phoned him. of course he bloody did. now save me a little time - where should we be looking? ""we""? anderson: mr. holmes? for god's sake! anderson?! sorry, sherlock, it's for your own good. oh, that's him, isn't it? you said he'd be taller. some members of your little fan club. do be polite. they're entirely trustworthy and even willing to search through the toxic waste dump that you are pleased to call a flat. you're a celebrity these days, sherlock. you can't afford a drug habit. i do not have a drug habit. john: hey, what happened to my chair? it was blocking my view to the kitchen. well, it's good to be missed! you were gone, i saw an opportunity. no, you saw the kitchen. what have you found so far? clearly, nothing. there's nothing to find! your bedroom door is shut. you haven't been home all night. so, why would a man who has never knowingly closed a door without the direct orders of his mother bother to do so on this occasion? okay, stop, just stop! point made. jesus, sherlock! i shall have to phone our parents, of course. in oklahoma. it won't be the first time that your substance abuse has wreaked havoc with their line dancing. this is not what you think. this is for a case. what case could possibly justify this? magnussen. charles augustus magnussen. that name you think you may have just heard, you were mistaken. if you ever mention hearing that name in this room, in this context, i guarantee you, on behalf of the british security services, that materials will be found on your computer hard-drives, resulting in your immediate incarceration. don't reply, just look frightened and scuttle. i hope i won't have to threaten you as well. well, i think we'd both find that embarrassing. magnussen is not your business. oh, you mean he's yours? you may consider him under my protection. i consider you under his thumb. if you go against magnussen, then you will find yourself going against me. okay. i'll let you know if i notice. um, what was i going to say? oh, yeah. bye-bye. unwise, brother mine. ohh! ugh! brother mine... ...don't appal me when i'm high. mycroft, don't say another word, just go. he could snap you in two and right now, i'm slightly worried that he might. don't speak, just leave. oh. (he clears his throat) er, magnussen? what time is it? about eight. i'll be meeting him in three hours. i need a bath. it's for a case, you say? yep. what sort of case? too big and dangerous for any sane individual to get involved in. you trying to put me off? god, no. trying to recruit you. and stay out of my bedroom. oh, john, hi. how are you? janine? sorry, not dressed. has everybody gone? i heard shouting. yes, they're gone. god, look at the time. i'll be late. it sounded like an argument. was it mike? mike? mike, yeah. his brother, mike. they're always fighting. mycroft. do people actually call him that? yeah. huh! oh, could you be a love and put some coffee on? sure, right, yeah. thanks. oh, how is mary? how's married life? she's fine. we're both fine. yeah. oh, it's over there now. where's sherl? (sherl!) er, he's just having a bath. i'm sure he'll be out in a minute. oh, like he ever is! yeah. (she knocks on door) morning. room for a little one? (sherlock and janine giggle) morning. (sherlock laughs) ooh! so, it's just a guess, but you've probably got some questions? yeah, one or two. pretty much. naturally. you have a girlfriend? yes, i have. now, magnussen. magnussen is like a shark. it's the only way i can describe him. have you ever been to the shark tank at the london. aquarium, john? stood up close to the glass? those floating, flat faces, those dead eyes. that's what he is. i've dealt with murderers, psychopaths, terrorists, serial killers. none of them can turn my stomach like charles augustus magnussen. yes, you have? sorry, what? you have a girlfriend? what? yes, yes, i'm going out with janine. i thought that was fairly obvious. yes. well, yes. (he clears his throat) you... you... you are in a relationship? yes, i am. you and janine? hmm. yes, me and janine. care to elaborate? well, we're in a good place. it's, um... very affirming. you got that from a book. everyone got that from a book. okay, you two bad boys. behave yourselves. you, sherl, you're going to have to tell me where you were last night. working. working? of course. i'm the only one who really knows what you're like, remember? well, don't you go letting on. i might just, actually. i haven't told mary about this. i kind of wanted to surprise her. yeah, i think you probably will. but we should have you two over for dinner, really soon. yeah. my place though, not the scuzz-dump. great, yeah. dinner, yeah. i'd better dash. it was brilliant to see you. you too. have a lovely day. call me later. i might do. i might call you. unless i meet someone prettier. solve me a crime, sherlock holmes. you know magnussen as a newspaper owner, but he is so much more than that. he uses his power and wealth to gain information. the more he acquires, the greater his wealth and power. and i'm not exaggerating when i say that he knows the critical pressure point on every person of note or influence in the whole of the western world and probably beyond. he is the napoleon of blackmail. and he has created an unassailable architecture of forbidden knowledge. its name... is appledore. dinner? sorry, what dinner? me and mary coming for dinner with... wine and... sitting. seriously? i have just told you that the western world is run from this house and you want to talk about dinner? fine. talk about the house. it is the greatest repository of sensitive and dangerous information anywhere in the world, the alexandrian library of secrets and scandals and none of it is on a computer. he's smart. computers can be hacked. it's all on hard copy, in vaults, underneath that house. and as long as it is, the personal freedom of anyone you've ever met is a fantasy. (knocking on door) that was the doorbell. couldn't you hear it? it's in the fridge. it kept ringing. oh, that's not a fault, sherlock! who is it? mr. holmes said you can go right up. oh. go ahead. sir? can i have a moment? he's fine. look, i... right. i should probably tell you... okay, i... there. doesn't mean i'm not pleased to see you. i can vouch for this man. he is a doctor. if you know who i am, then you know who he is. don't you, mr. magnussen? i understood we were meeting at your office. this is my office. well, it is now. mr. magnussen, i have been asked to intercede with you by lady elizabeth smallwood on the matter of her husband's letters. some time ago you put pressure on her concerning those letters. she would like those letters back. obviously, the letters no longer have any practical use to you, so with that in mind... something i said? no, no. i was reading. there's rather a lot. redbeard? sorry. sorry, you were probably talking. i... i was trying to explain that i have been asked to act on behalf of... bathroom? along from the kitchen, sir. okay. i've been asked to negotiate the return of those letters. i am aware you do not make copies of sensitive documents. is it like the rest of the flat? sir? the bathroom? yes, sir. maybe not then. am i acceptable to you as an intermediary? lady elizabeth smallwood... i like her. mr. magnussen, am i acceptable to you as an intermediary? she's english with a spine. best thing about the english... ...you're so domesticated. all standing around, apologising... ...keeping your little heads down. you can do what you like here. no-one's ever going to stop you. a nation of herbivores. (urine trickles) i have interests all over the world but... everything starts in england. if it works here... (zips up trousers) ...i try it in a real country. the united kingdom, petri dish to the western world. tell lady elizabeth i might need those letters so... i'm keeping them. goodbye. anyway... ...they're funny. jesus! did you notice the one extraordinary thing he did? there was a moment that kind of stuck in the mind, yeah. exactly. when he showed us the letters. okay. so, he's brought the letters to london, so no matter what he says, he's ready to make a deal. now, magnussen only makes a deal once he's established a person's weaknesses, the pressure point, he calls it. so, clearly he believes i'm a drug addict and no serious threat. and of course, because he's in town tonight, the letters will be in his safe in his london office while he's out to dinner with the marketing group of gb from seven till ten. how do you know his schedule? because i do. i'll see you tonight. i've got some shopping to do. what's tonight? i'll text instructions. yeah, i'll text you if i'm available. you are, i checked. don't bring a gun. why would i bring a gun? or a knife or a tyre lever. probably best not to do any arm-spraining, but we'll see how the night goes. are you just assuming i'm coming along? time you got out of the house, john. you've put on 7lbs since you married and the cycling isn't doing it. it's actually 4lbs. mary and i think seven. see you later. tv reporter: and breaking news now. john garvie mp has been arrested today on charges of corruption. this follows an investigation... magnussen's office is on the top floor, just below his private flat. there are 14 layers of security between us and him, two of which aren't even legal in this country. want to know how we're going to break in? is that what we're doing? of course it's what we're doing. magnussen's private lift. goes straight to his penthouse and office. only he uses it and only his keycard calls the lift. if anyone else even tries, security is automatically informed. standard keycard for the building. nicked it yesterday. only gets us as far as the canteen. here we go then. if i was to use this card on that lift now, what happens? well, the alarms would go off and you'd be dragged away by security. exactly. get taken to a small room somewhere and your head kicked in. do we really need so much colour? it passes the time. but if i do this... if you press a keycard against your mobile phone for long enough, it corrupts the magnetic strip. the card stops working. it's a common problem. never put your keycard with your phone. what happens if i use the card now? it still doesn't work. but it doesn't read as the wrong card now. it registers as corrupted. but if it's corrupted, how do they know it's not magnussen? would they risk dragging him off? probably not. so, what do they do? what do they have to do? check if it's him or not. there's a camera at eye height to the right of the door. a live picture of the card user is relayed directly to magnussen's personal staff in his office, the only people trusted to make a positive id. at this hour, almost certainly his pa. so, how does that help us? human error. i've been shopping. here we go then. you realise you don't exactly look like magnussen? which in this case is a considerable advantage. (beeping) sherlock, you complete loon. what are you doing?! hang on, was that...? hi, janine. go on, let me in. i can't. you know i can't. don't be silly. don't make me do it out here. not in front of everyone. do what in front of everyone? you see, as long as there's people, there's always a weak spot. that was janine. yes, of course it was. she's magnussen's pa. that's the whole point. did you just get engaged to break into an office? yeah. stroke of luck meeting her at your wedding. you can take some of the credit. jesus! sherlock, she loves you. yes. like i said, human error. what are you going to do? well, not actually marry her, obviously. there's only so far you can go. so, what will you tell her? well, i'll tell her that our entire relationship was a ruse to break into her boss' office. i imagine she'll want to stop seeing me at that point, but you're the expert on women. so, where did she go? that's a bit rude. i just proposed to her. sherlock. did she faint? do they really do that?! it's a blow to the head. she's breathing. janine? (she murmurs) another in here. security. does he need help? ex-con. white supremacist by the tattoos, so who cares? stick with janine. janine, focus on my voice. can you hear me? hey, they must still be here. so is magnussen. his seat's still warm. he should be at dinner, but he's still in the building. upstairs. we should call the police. during our own burglary? you're really not a natural at this, are you? no, wait. sssh. perfume and not janine's. claire de la lune. why do i know it? mary wears it. no, not mary. somebody else. (clanging) sherlock! what would your husband think? your lovely husband, upright and honourable, so english. what would he say to you now? no, no! you're doing this to protect him from the truth? well, is this the protection he would want? additionally, if you're going to commit murder, you might consider changing your perfume, lady smallwood. sorry. who? that's... not lady smallwood, mr. holmes. is john with you? he's, um... is john here? he's downstairs. so, what do you do now? kill us both? mary, whatever he's got on you, let me help. oh, sherlock, if you take one more step, i swear i will kill you. no, mrs. watson... you won't. i'm sorry, sherlock. i truly am. mary? (alarm rings) it's not like it is in the movies. there's not a great big spurt of blood and you go flying backwards. the impact isn't spread over a wide area. it's tightly focused so there's little or no energy transfer. you stay still and the bullet pushes through. you're almost certainly going to die, so we need to focus. i said, ""focus!"" it's all well and clever having a mind palace, but you've only three seconds of consciousness left to use it. so, come on. what's going to kill you? blood loss. exactly. so, it's all about one thing now forwards or backwards? we need to decide which way you're going to fall. one hole or two? sorry? is the bullet still inside you? or is there an exit wound? it'll depend on the gun. that one, i think. or that one. oh, for god's sake, sherlock. it doesn't matter about the gun. don't be stupid. you always were so stupid. such a disappointment. i'm not stupid. you're a very stupid little boy. mummy and daddy are very cross because it doesn't matter about the gun. why not? you saw the whole room when you entered it. what was directly behind you when you were murdered? i've not been murdered yet. balance of probability, little brother. if the bullet had passed through you, what would you have heard? the mirror shattering. you didn't. therefore...? the bullet's still inside me. so we need to take him down backwards. i agree. sherlock, you need to fall on your back. right now the bullet is the cork in a bottle. the bullet itself is blocking most of the blood flow. but any pressure or impact on the entrance wound could dislodge it. plus, on your back, gravity's working for us. fall... now. (alarm rings) what the hell is that?! what's happening?! you're going into shock. it's the next thing that's going to kill you. what do i do? don't go into shock, obviously. must be something in this ridiculous memory palace of yours that can calm you down. find it. the east wind is coming, sherlock. it's coming to get you. (screams echo) find it. hello, redbeard. here, boy. come on. come to me. it's okay. it's all right. young sherlock: come on. it's me. it's me. come on. good boy. clever boy. good boy. hello, redbeard. they're putting me down too now. it's no fun, is it? redbeard. that was shock. you're going to feel the pain. there's a hole ripped through you. massive internal bleeding. you have to control the pain. control. control. control. you... you never felt pain, did you? why did you never feel pain? you always feel it, sherlock. but you don't have to fear it! (sherlock groans) pain... ...heartbreak... ...loss... ...death... ...it's all good. it's all good. sherlock! sherlock. can you hear me? what happened? he got shot. jesus! sherlock. oh, my! who shot him?! 'emergency. which service do you require?' ♪ it's raining ♪ it's pouring ♪ sherlock is boring ♪ i'm laughing ♪ i'm crying ♪ sherlock is dying. ♪ sherlock! we're losing you. sherlock! come on, sherlock. just die, why can't you? one little push and off you pop. you're going to love being dead, sherlock. no-one ever bothers you. mrs. hudson will cry... and mummy and daddy will cry... and the woman will cry and john will cry buckets and buckets. it's him that i worry about the most. that wife! you're letting him down, sherlock. john watson is definitely in danger. oh, you're not getting better, are you? was it something i said, huh? sherlock! (sherlock groans) mary. hey. he's only bloody woken up. he's pulled through. really? yeah. seriously? you... mrs. watson, you're in big trouble. really? why? his first word when he woke up... ""mary."" (he chuckles) you don't tell him. sherlock? you don't tell john. bad girl. bad, bad girl. look at me... ...and tell me you're not going to tell him. i'm buying a cottage. i've made a lot of money out of you, mister. nothing hits the spot like revenge with profits. you didn't give those stories to magnussen, did you? god, no. one of his rivals. he was spitting. hmm. sherlock holmes, you are a back-stabbing, heartless, manipulative bastard. and you, as it turns out, are a grasping, opportunistic, publicity-hungry, tabloid whore. so, we're good then? yeah, of course. where's the cottage? sussex downs. nice. it's gorgeous. there's beehives, but i'm getting rid of those. (he gasps) oh, it hurts, does it? probably want to restart your morphine. i might have fiddled with the taps. how much more revenge are you going to need? just the occasional top-up. dream come true for you, this place. they actually attach the drugs to you. not good for working. you won't be working for a while, sherl. you lied to me. you lied and lied. i exploited the fact of our connection. when? just once would have been nice. oh. i was waiting till we got married. that was never going to happen. got to go. i'm not supposed to keep you talking. and also, i have an interview with the one show and i haven't made it up yet. just one thing... you shouldn't have lied to me. i know what kind of man you are, but we could have been friends. i'll give your love to john and mary. you don't tell him. you don't tell john. so... ...mary watson... ...who are you? mary watson. i don't know how much sense you'll get out of him. he's drugged up, so he's pretty much babbling. oh, they won't let you use that in here, you know? no, i'm not going to use the phone. i just want to take a video. oh, jesus! so, where would he go? oh, christ knows! try finding sherlock in london. he's got three known bolt-holes. parliament hill, camden lock and dagmar court. five known bolt holes. there's the blind greenhouse in kew gardens and the leaning tomb in hampstead cemetery. just the spare bedroom. well, my bedroom. we agreed he needs the space. behind the clock face of big ben. i think he was probably joking. no, i don't think so. leinster gardens. it's his number one bolt hole. top, top secret. he only knows about it cos he stalked him one night. followed! followed, yeah. he knew who shot him. the bullet wound was here, so he was facing whoever it was. so, why not tell us? because he's tracking them down himself. or protecting them. protecting the shooter, why? well, protecting someone then. but why would he care? he's sherlock. who would he bother protecting? call me if you hear anything. don't hold out on me, john. call me, okay? yeah. yeah, right. good night then. bye then. john, need a cuppa? mrs. hudson, why does sherlock think that i'll be moving back in here? oh, yes, he's put your chair back again, hasn't he? that's nice. it looks much better. john, what's wrong? tell me. john? (mobile buzzes) that's your phone, isn't it? it's sherlock, john. sherlock. john, you have to answer it! spare any change, love? no. oh, come on, love. don't be like all the rest. rule one of looking for sherlock holmes, he finds you. you're working for sherlock now? keeps me off the streets, doesn't it? well... no. (mobile rings) where are you? 'can't you see me?' well, what am i looking for? the lie, the lie of leinster gardens, hidden in plain sight. hardly anyone notices. people live here for years and never see it. 'but if you are what i think you are, it will take you less than a minute. the houses, mary. look at the houses. how did you know i'd come here? i knew you'd talk to the people no-one else would bother with. huh, i thought i was being clever. you're always clever, mary, i was relying on that. i planted the information for you to find. ohh! 30 seconds. but what am i looking at? no door knobs, no letterbox. painted windows. 23 and 24 leinster gardens. the empty houses. they were demolished years ago to make way for the london underground, a vent for the old steam trains. only the very front section of the house remains. it's just a facade. remind you of anyone, mary? a facade? sorry, i never could resist a touch of drama. do come in. it's a little cramped. do you own this place? hmm, i won it in a card game with the clarence house cannibal. nearly cost me my kidneys, but fortunately i had a straight flush. quite a gambler, that woman. what do you want, sherlock? mary morstan was stillborn in october 1972. her gravestone is in chiswick cemetery, where five years ago you acquired her name and date of birth, and thereafter her identity. that's why you don't have friends from before that date. need to work on your half of the church, mary. looking a bit thin. oh, orphan's lot. friends, that's all i have. it's an old enough technique, known to the kinds of people who could recognise a skip code on sight... at first i thought it was just a bible thing, spam, but it's not. it's a skip code. ...have extraordinarily retentive memories. how can you not remember which room? you remember everything! i have to delete something! 207. you were very slow. how good a shot are you?' how badly do you want to find out? if i die here, my body would be found in a building with your face projected on the front of it. 'even scotland yard could get somewhere with that. i want to know how good you are. go on, show me. the doctor's wife must be a little bit bored by now. (gunshot) may i see? huh, it's a dummy. well, i suppose that was a fairly obvious trick. and yet, over a distance of six feet, you failed to make a kill shot. enough to hospitalise me, not enough to kill me. that wasn't a miss, that was surgery. i'll take the case. what case? yours. why didn't you come to me in the first place? because john can't ever know that i lied to him. it would break him and i would lose him forever. and sherlock, i will never let that happen. please, understand, there is nothing in this world i would not do to stop that happening. sorry. not that obvious a trick. now talk and sort it out and do it quickly. music: ""hark! the herald angels sing"". oh, dear god, it's only two o'clock. it's been christmas day for at least a week now. how can it only be two o'clock? i'm in agony. mikey, is this your laptop? upon which depends the security of the free world, yes, and you've got potatoes on it! you shouldn't leave it lying around if it's so important. why are we doing this? we never do this. we are here because sherlock is home from hospital and we are all very happy. am i happy too? i haven't checked. behave, mike! mycroft is the name you gave me, if you could possibly struggle all the way to the end. mrs. holmes. oh, thank you, dear. i'm not absolutely sure why you're here. i invited him. i'm his protege, mrs. holmes. when he dies, i get all his stuff and his job. no. oh, well, i help out a bit. closer. if he does get murdered or something... probably stop talking now. okay. lovely when you bring your friends round! stop it, you. somebody's put a bullet in my boy. if i ever find out who, i shall turn absolutely monstrous. this was for mary. i'll be back in a minute. ah. mary. there you are. cup of tea. if father starts making little humming noises, just give him a little poke. that usually does it. did you write this? oh, that silly old thing, you mustn't read that. mathematics must seem terribly fatuous now. no humming, you. complete flake, my wife, but happens to be a genius. she was a mathematician? gave it all up for children. i could never bear to argue with her. i'm something of a moron myself. but she's... unbelievably hot. oh my god, you're the sane one, aren't you? aren't you? oh. sorry, i just, er... oh, you two need a moment? if you don't mind? no, course not. i'll go and see if i can help with... something or another. those two. they all right? well, you know, they've had their ups and downs. baker street, now. john, mary... oh, sherlock, oh, good gracious, you look terrible! get me some morphine from your kitchen, i've run out. i don't have any morphine. then what exactly is the point of you?! what is going on? bloody good question. the watsons are about to have a domestic and fairly quickly i hope, because we've got work to do. no, i have a better question is everyone i have ever met a psychopath? yes. good that we've settled that. now we... shut up! and stay shut up, because this is not funny. not this time. i didn't say it was funny. you. what have i ever done? hmm? my whole life, to deserve you? everything. sherlock, i've told you, shut up. no, i mean it - seriously, everything. everything you've ever done, is what you did. sherlock, one more word and you will not need morphine. you were a doctor who went to war. you're a man who couldn't stay in the suburbs for more than a month without storming a crack den, beating up a junkie. your best friend is a sociopath, who solves crimes as an alternative to getting high. that's me, by the way, hello. even the landlady used to run a drug cartel. it was my husband's cartel. i was just typing. and exotic dancing. sherlock holmes, if you've been youtubing... john, you are addicted to a certain lifestyle. you are abnormally attracted to dangerous situations and people, so is it truly such a surprise that the woman you fall in love with conforms to that pattern? but she wasn't supposed to be like that! why is she like that? because you chose her. why is everything always. my fault?! oh, neighbours! john, listen. be calm and answer me. what is she? my lying wife? no, what is she? and the woman who is carrying my child, who has lied to me since the day i met her. no. not in this flat, not in this room. right here, right now, what is she? okay. your way. always your way. (he clears throat) sit. why? because that's where they sit. the people who come in here with their stories. they're the clients, that's all you are now, mary. you're a client. this is where you sit and talk and this is where we sit and listen. then we decide if we want you or not. so, are you okay? oh, are we doing conversation today? it really is christmas! now? seriously, months of silence and we're going to do this now? a.g.r.a., what's that? er... my initials. everything about who i was is on there. if you love me, don't read it in front of me. why? because you won't love me when you've finished and i don't want to see that happen. (watson sighs) how much do you know already? by your skill set, you are, or were, an intelligence agent. your accent is currently english, but i suspect you are not. you're on the run from something. you've used your skills to disappear. magnussen knows your secret, which is why you were going to kill him. and i assume you befriended janine in order to get close to him. oh, you can talk! oh, look at you two, you should have got married. the stuff magnussen has on me, i would go to prison for the rest of my life. so you were going to kill him? people like magnussen should be killed, that's why there are people like me. perfect! so that's what you were, an assassin? how could i not see that? you did see that. and you married me. because he's right. it's what you like. so, mary, any documents that magnussen has concerning yourself, you want extracted and returned. why would you help me? because you saved my life. sorry-sorry, what? when i happened on you and magnussen... ...you had a problem. more specifically, you had a witness. what do you do now? kill both of us? (gunshot) the solution, of course, was simple. kill us both and leave. however, sentiment got the better of you. one precisely calculated shot to incapacitate me, in the hope that it would buy you more time to negotiate my silence. of course, you couldn't shoot magnussen. on the night both of us broke into the building, your own husband would become a suspect. so... you calculated that magnussen would use the fact of your involvement... rather than sharing the information with the police, as is his mo. and then you left the way you came. have i missed anything? how did she save your life? she phoned the ambulance. i phoned the ambulance. she phoned first. 'emergency, which service do you require?' you didn't find me for another five minutes. left to you, i would have died. the average arrival time for a london ambulance is... did somebody call an ambulance? eight minutes. did you bring any morphine? i asked on the phone. we were told there was a shooting. there was, last week. but i believe i'm bleeding internally, my pulse is very erratic, you may need to restart my heart on the way... jesus, sherlock. come on, sherlock. argh! john, john, magnussen is all that matters now. you can trust mary - she saved my life. she shot you. mixed messages, i grant you that... argh! sherlock! sherlock! take him. got him? yeah. (sherlock grunts in pain) so, have you read it? would you come here a moment? no, tell me, have you? just... come here. no, i'm fine. i've thought long and hard about what i want to say to you. these are prepared words, mary. i've chosen these words with care. okay. (he clears his throat) the problems of your past are your business. the problems of your future... are my privilege. it's all i have to say, it's all i need to know. no, i didn't read it. you don't even know my name. is ""mary watson"" good enough for you? yes. oh my god, yes. then it's good enough for me, too. (she sobs) all this does not mean that i'm not still basically pissed off with you. hmm, i know, i know. i am very pissed off, and it will come out now and then. i know, i know, i know. you can mow the sodding lawn from now on. i do mow the lawn. i do it loads. you really don't. i choose the baby's name. not a chance. okay. i'm glad you've given up on the magnussen business. are you? i'm still curious, though. he's hardly your usual kind of puzzle. why do you hate him? because he attacks people who are different and preys on their secrets. why don't you? he never causes too much damage to anyone important. he's far too intelligent for that. he's a businessman, that's all. and occasionally useful to us. a necessary evil, not a dragon for you to slay. a dragon-slayer. is that what you think of me? no. it's what you think of yourself. are you two smoking?! no. it was mycroft. i have, by the way, a job offer i should like you to decline. i decline your kind offer. i shall pass on your regrets. what was it? mi6. they want to place you back into eastern europe. an undercover assignment that would prove fatal to you in, i think, about six months. then why don't you want me to take it? it's tempting, but on balance, you have more utility closer to home. utility! how do i have utility? here be dragons. (he coughs) this isn't agreeing with me. i'm going in. you need low tar. you still smoke like a beginner. also... ...your loss would break my heart. (he coughs) what the hell am i supposed to say to that?! merry christmas? you hate christmas. yes. perhaps there was something in the punch. clearly. go and have some more. so you realise that sherlock got us out here to see his mum and dad for a reason? his lovely mum and dad, a fine example of married life, i get that. that is the thing with sherlock, it's always the unexpected. oi. oi? mary? jesus christ! mary? sit down. mary, can you hear me? don't drink mary's tea. or the punch. sherlock... did you just drug my pregnant wife?! don't worry, wiggins is an excellent chemist. i calculated your wife's dose myself. won't affect the little one. i'll keep an eye on her. he'll monitor their recovery. it's more or less his day job. what the hell have you done?! a deal with the devil. shouldn't you be in hospital? i am in hospital. this is the canteen. is it? in my opinion, yes. have a seat. thank you. i've been thinking about you. i've been thinking about you. really? i want to see appledore. where you keep all the secrets, all the files, everything you've got on everyone. i want you to invite me. what makes you think i'd be so careless? oh, i think you're a lot more careless than you let on. am i? it's the dead-eyed stare that gives it away. except it's not dead-eyed, is it? you're reading. portable appledore. how does it work? built-in flash drive? 4g wireless? they're just ordinary spectacles. yes, they are. you underestimate me, mr. holmes. impress me, then. show me appledore. everything is available for a price. are you making me an offer? a christmas present. and what are you giving me for christmas, mr. holmes? my brother. oh, jesus! sherlock, please tell me you haven't just gone out of your mind. i'd rather keep you guessing. (helicopter whirs) ah, there's our lift. coming? where? you want your wife to be safe? of course i do. good, because this is going to be incredibly dangerous. one false move and we'll have betrayed the security of the united kingdom and be in prison for high treason. magnussen is the most dangerous man we've ever encountered and the odds are comprehensively stacked against us. but it's christmas! i feel the same. oh, you mean it's actually christmas. did you bring your gun, as i suggested? why would i bring my gun to your parents' house for christmas dinner?! is it in your coat? yes. off we go, then. where are we going? appledore. i would offer you a drink, but it's very rare and expensive. oh, it was you. yes, of course. very hard to find a pressure point on you, mr. holmes. the drugs thing i never believed for a moment. anyway, you wouldn't care if it was exposed, would you? but look how you care about john watson. your damsel in distress. you put me in a fire, for leverage?! oh, i would never let you burn, dr watson. i had people standing by. i'm not a murderer. unlike your wife. let me explain how leverage works, dr watson. for those who understand these things, mycroft holmes is the most powerful man in the country. well, apart from me. mycroft's pressure point is his junkie detective brother, sherlock. sherlock's pressure point is his best friend, john watson. john watson's pressure point is his wife. i own john watson's wife, i own mycroft. he's what i'm getting for christmas. it's an exchange, not a gift. forgive me, but... i already seem to have it. it's password protected. in return for the password, you will give me any material in your possession pertaining to the woman i know as mary watson. oh, she's bad, that one. so many dead people. you should see what i've seen. i don't need to see it. you might enjoy it, though. i enjoy it. then why don't you show us? show you appledore? the secret vaults. is that what you want? i want everything you've got on mary. (he chuckles) you know, i honestly expected something good. oh, i think you'll find the contents of that laptop... include a gps locator. by now your brother will have noticed the theft and the security services will be converging on this house. having arrived, they'll find top-secret information in my hands and they have every justification to search my vaults. they will discover further information of this kind and i will be imprisoned. you would be exonerated and restored to your smelly little apartment to solve crimes with mr. and mrs. psychopath. mycroft has been looking for this opportunity for a long time. he'll be a very, very proud big brother. the fact that you know it's going to happen isn't going to stop it. then why am i smiling? ask me. why are you smiling? because sherlock holmes has made one enormous mistake, which will destroy the lives of everyone he loves. and everything he holds dear. let me show you the appledore vaults. the entrance to my vaults. this is where i keep you all. okay, so where are the vaults, then? vaults? what vaults? there are no vaults beneath this building. they're all in here. the appledore vaults are my mind palace. you know about mind palaces, don't you, sherlock? how to store information so you never forget it, by picturing it. i just sit here, i close my eyes and down i go to my vaults. i can go anywhere inside my vaults. my memories. i'll look at the files on mrs. watson. (he clears his throat) hmm. oh, this is one of my favourites. oh, it's so exciting. all those wet jobs for the cia. ooh, she's gone a bit freelance now, bad girl. (he chuckles) oh, she's so wicked. i can really see why you like her. you see? so there are no documents, you don't actually have anything here? oh, sometimes i send out for something, if i really need it, but mostly i just remember it all. i don't understand. you should have that on a t-shirt. you just remember it all? it's all about knowledge, everything is. knowing is owning. but if you just know it, then you don't have proof. proof? what would i need proof for? i'm in news, you moron. i don't have to prove it, i just have to print it. speaking of news... you'll both be heavily featured tomorrow. trying to sell state secrets to me. tut tut. let's go outside. they'll be here shortly. can't wait to see you arrested. sherlock, do we have a plan? sherlock? they're taking their time, aren't they? i still don't understand. and there's the back of the t-shirt. you just know things - how does that work? i just love your little soldier face. i'd like to punch it. bring it over here a minute. come on. for mary. bring me your face. (he clears throat) lean forward a bit and stick your face out. please. now, can i flick it? look at me. can i flick your face? i just love doing this. i could do it all day. well, it works like this, john. i know who mary hurt and killed. i know where to find people who hate her. i know where they live, i know their phone numbers. all in my mind palace, all of it. i could phone them right now and tear your whole life down... ...and i will, unless you let me flick your face. this is what i do to people. this is what i do to whole countries. just because i know. can i do your eye now? see if you can keep it open, hmm? come on, for mary. keep it open. sherlock? let him. i'm sorry, just... let him. hmm? come on, eye open. (magnussen chuckles) it's difficult, isn't it? janine managed to once. she makes the funniest noises. sherlock holmes and john watson, stand away from that man. here we go, mr. holmes. to clarify, appledore's vaults only exist in your mind, nowhere else, just there? they're not real, they never have been. sherlock holmes and john watson, step away! it's fine, they're harmless. target is not armed, i repeat target is not armed. sherlock, what do we do? nothing. there is nothing to be done. oh, i'm not a villain, i have no evil plan. i'm a businessman, acquiring assets. you happen to be one of them. sorry, no chance for you to be a hero this time, mr. holmes. sherlock holmes and john watson, stand away from that man. do it now! oh, do your research. i'm not a hero, i'm a high-functioning sociopath. merry christmas! (gunshot) man down, man down. get away from me, john! stay well back! christ, sherlock! don't fire! do not fire on sherlock holmes! do not fire! oh christ, sherlock! give my love to mary. tell her she's safe now. oh, sherlock. what have you done? as my colleague is fond of remarking, this country sometimes needs a blunt instrument. equally, it sometimes needs a dagger, a scalpel wielded with precision and without remorse. there will always come a time when we need sherlock holmes. if this is some expression of familial sentiment... don't be absurd. i am not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion. you know what happened to the other one. in any event, there is no prison in which we could incarcerate sherlock without causing a riot on a daily basis. the alternative, however, would require your approval. hardly merciful, mr. holmes. regrettably, lady smallwood, my brother is a murderer. you will look after him for me, won't you? hmm. don't worry. i'll keep him in trouble. that's my girl. since this is likely to be the last conversation i'll have with john watson, would you mind if we took a moment? so here we are. william sherlock scott holmes. sorry? that's the whole of it. if you're looking for baby names. (watson chuckles) no, we've had a scan, we're pretty sure it's a girl. oh. okay. yeah. you know, actually, i can't think of a single thing to say. no, neither can i. the game is over. the game is never over, john. but there may be some new players now. that's okay, the east wind takes us all in the end. what's that? it's a story my brother told me when we were kids. the east wind is a terrifying force that lays waste to all in its path. it seeks out the unworthy and plucks them from the earth. that was generally me. nice! he's a rubbish big brother. so what about you, then? where are you actually going now? oh, some undercover work in eastern europe. for how long? six months, my brother estimates. he's never wrong. and then what? who knows? john, there's something i should say, i've meant to say always and i never have. since it's unlikely we'll ever meet again, i might as well say it now. sherlock is actually a girl's name. it's not. it was worth a try. we're not naming our daughter after you. oh, i think it could work. to the very best of times, john. tv: 'smith brings it inside. this looks good. 'cassandra comes in for a shot. ooh, he missed it!' oi, there's something wrong with the telly. there's something wrong with the telly, mate. who's that? distorted voice: did you miss me? did you miss me? did you miss me? did you miss me? did you miss me? how is this possible? we don't know, but it's on every screen in the country. every screen simultaneously. has the prime minister been told? and mycroft? but that's not possible. that is simply not possible. what's happened? sir? it's your brother. mycroft? hello, little brother. how's the exile going?' i've only been gone four minutes. well, i certainly hope you've learnt your lesson. as it turns out, you're needed. oh, for god's sake, make up your mind! who needs me this time? did you miss me? did you miss me? did you miss me? did you miss me? did you miss me? did you miss me? did you miss me? did you miss me?' england. but he's dead. i mean, you told me he was dead, moriarty? absolutely. blew his own brains out. so how can he be back? well if he is, he'd better wrap up warm. there's an east wind coming. miss me?"
1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,"good evening. because the television screen distorts the human figure, some people have the mistaken idea that im larger than the average. i can only say that if you think i am large, now you should see me before taxes. no doubt inspired by this impression a well-meaning viewer, has sent me a reducing machine. however it is so unique i want to share it with you. it is amazingly successful in cutting off those extra pounds. as you see this is a revolutionary concept, in weight reduction. these exquisite machines come in a number of sizes. this is the madame lafage model, except for two knitting needles, it has no extras at all. from this they are variously priced up to the salon size, which comes with a parking lot for tumbrils, and a small crowd to jeer and spit at you. im certain you will agree that the advertisements for the salon model, do not exaggerate when they say it is fit for a king. but we have a dramatic show to present, if i were a critical man, i would say the production could be vastly improved, by some judicious pruning. for example this... deathmate three, oh you're good very good. you're good at everything aren't you conan? well i don't know peter. as the man said just lucky i guess. oh, not lucky just good. lisa doesn't think you're lucky. not lisa. she thinks you're good too. don't you lisa? oh i think ben is very good in lots of ways. so far he's beaten your cards, billiards, and at your own favorite game, golf, which reminds me to remind you, did you pay him the fifty dollars he won from you yesterday? fifty dollars? i must forget the payoff bets. ill write a check, my check good enough for you conan? sure it is. but i still don't want it. however you insist on paying off a bet. you lost this last game, so chug it down again. some lousy game. well here goes nothing. i think that's enough for now old man. not so fast there, you gotta give me a chance to win. tomorrow's another day, -ill give you a chance then, all right? -tomorrow is too late. i insist now, right here and now. take it easy you better lie down for a while. -come on peter take a nap. -once you know about it. you don't fool me lisa i know you. who's ben conan think he is anyway? just a friend peter that's all. ben, what makes a man change so much? in just two short years. when i first married him, -he seemed so strong, so capable. -well no one really knows what, makes a man the way he is. what forces him to do the things he does, it's for me pretending to be a psychiatrist. no ben, but you're kind. steady dependable. you're just the way men should be. it's getting dark. dusk, the loneliest time of day. is it that way for you too? it's that way for everybody in the world? only for those who don't have anyone. and this solitude finds you out and you look for the face you love. -but it isn't there. -and you listen for a voice, and it isn't there either. i think i know what you're going to say. it's a crazy world isn't it? and you hardly know me, is that what you were going to say? no, what i was going to say... just two short weeks ago i didn't even know you were alive. and now, now you're the most important thing in my life. -and i can't help it. -i hope you mean that. -because i love you. -i know that. it seems as if ive been waiting for you all my life. -and yet... -what? -you're right even though you won't say it. -we do know so little about each other. -i know i love you. and have since the first moment i saw you. as far as my past life is concerned there's really not much to tell. keep talking darling i love the sound of your voice. you know it's the first time we've ever been alone together. peter's in there. he'll be out for hours. and he also fired the servants this morning. tell me why didn't you ever get married? because i knew that somewhere in this world there was someone like you, id never met her but i wouldn't settle for less. so i remained in arizona and kept busy with my mind. -mine a gold mine? -no darling a silver mine. although i must admit it kept me in beans and sourdough, and an occasional trip to europe thrown in, -or at least it used to. -used to? -are you having problems? -no no no it'll all work out. business worries can make a person sick. very nearly did me. three years ago when my father died he left the business to me, then after i married peter, i gave him authority to manage it. when i found out what he was like, i asked him for a divorce. he just laughed at me, with the community property... it seems we're orphans of the storm, the financial storm that is, but we'll make out. sorry mr conan, maybe i should call you fred sheldon or terry lord? i think you're making a mistake. -people are often mistaking me for... -so? know who i always took you for? no, and i don't care, now if you'll excuse me im on my way to breakfast. ill tell you who i thought you were, and i could stand some coffee myself. oh we could sit down here for a couple of minutes, no use causing a scene if we don't have to is it. this is highly embarrassing. now what in places are you talking about? about a lad named fred sheldon wanted for bigamy in miami. this sheldons a real doll, he's lived off women for years, bleeds widows, blackmails married dames, anything for a buck, and when he's through with them, some of them take over doses of sleeping pills. all very interesting, what was i got to do with me? well let's look at it this way, last year at this time he was posing as terry lord, a retired air force colonel, this year he calls himself ben conant, and pretends to own a silver mine. -and where do you come in? -oh yes my name is moss, alvin moss, ten years on the san francisco vice squad. im a private investigator now semi-retired, would you believe it? my client pays me 40 bucks a day for the past two weeks, to check on this sheldon character. and uh who is your client? let's not be naive. try it... please. so long sheldon. ive been worried about your phone call you sounded so mysterious. im sorry darling i didn't mean to be but, i had to see you. then there is something wrong? what is it? well it's not very pleasant. -have you seen peter at all today? -no he was still out when i left. why? because i wanted to tell you before anybody else did. -im afraid your husband is having us watched. -no. -he probably knows all about last night by now. -no benny can't. im afraid so darling. this morning a nasty little private eye character threatened me at my hotel. that's just like peter, not enough nerve to come to you himself. not only that, apparently he's paying this man to throw mud at me. calling me a crook, con man, i don't know what else. im sorry that, i don't know what to say. you should have never gotten involved with me. we are involved and it's our problem. now what are we going to do about it? what can we do? peter is jealous. and now this will be really dangerous. well, im scared. ive got to leave peter, tonight. and don't forget donnie with the evidence your husband has, he can fight you in court he'll take you for everything you've got. i can't let him do that. no im im the one who's leaving. no, let peter keep the business he's ruined it anyway. ive got you ben, and you're everything that peter isn't. -you're successful and... -successful? everything bad happens at once. this came this morning. i don't understand. i can't meet my payroll, they're closing the mine, that's what it means. but there's something you can do. sure sure, i can sell out to tri-state mining a big outfit for peanuts. fifty thousand dollars. how much money do you need? i don't know i suppose ten thousand would do it. what a fool i am, a month ago i had the money. right now im broke. id do anything darling, id work id make sacrifices. i know that that sounds stupid, corny, but i would. you could sell out to tri-state, you'd have fifty thousand dollars and you could get another position. it's not so easy these days and... i couldn't do that to you. i know it's awful of me, but i wish pete had, never survived that heart attack last month. i wish he was dead. with the heart the way it is maybe. and don't worry darling, we'll make out. -im going to get us two reservations on the flight for phoenix tonight. -oh wonderful. i think you'd better see your attorney this afternoon, and i...im trying to have a talk with peter. -my time would be best to see him. -but for? is usually up by then. i love you darling. -well well if it isn't mr conan? -may i come in? what do you want? i came to say goodbye. you got a nerve coming here? then, your type of business takes her, doesn't it? you want me to go away is that it? -to stop seeing your wife. -of course. although i must admit you and lisa are two of a kind. immorals, a couple of tiger sharks. i knew she married me for what she could get out of me. but i hardly dreamed she was such an incredibly gracious woman. and why are you so anxious to keep her? -unfortunately i happen to be in love with her. -and her money? -you got to be joking. -about what? i spotted you, the very first day. well well freddie sheldon. i stopped by to pick up my cigarette lighter. -i forgot it last night. -convenient. -where's talbot? -i don't know. -i guess nobody's here. -no then how'd you get in? i knocked, all right? -door's open. -isn't that always the case? ¿did you find your lighter? i haven't had a chance to look i just got here. i hear water running somewhere, let's take a look freddy. -ive got better things to do. -i said let's take a look. in there freddy. -what's happened? -im just going to ask you that freddy. so you did i,t you really did it? im surprised, i didn't think you had the guts. -are you out of your mind? -i heard you've been threatening his life. -you're crazy i never threatened him. from con man to murder in one easy jump. no no you got it all wrong it it was his heart. he had another attack just like before but but this time it killed him. you could do better than. -talbots heart was fine. -but i know it his wife told me. talbott was one of the richest men on the coast, if he was sick, you think he wouldn't have a pack of doctors? you're making it up, you're trying to frame me. he didn't have any money, he was sponging off his wife. you're killing me freddie look up talbot and dun and brad street. over that way. -you calling the cops? -yes but first im calling my client. client? he's dead. yes freddie, i said my client, the one who hired me and pays me. lisa talbot. by the way lisa and ben conan did not get married, if any of you are wondering. her studies would not permit it. she is working on an advanced degree at a large state penitentiary, where she must remain in residence some 20 years. i know many of you would like to see me use this machine, i shall do so in just one minute or, faster than my sponsor can do. next week we shall be back with another story, in answer to request for these machines, i would like to announce that they are available, at all french revolutionary war surplus stores. good night."

''kobali''? lf you ever met them, you'd remember. they look just like this. after the reanimation process, they spent months altering my dna. they were constantly scanning me, injecting me... just to make you look like one of them? that's how they procreate. they salvage the dead of other races. l was given a kobali name and placed with a family to help me acclimate. you were a prisoner. at first. l wanted to contact you to tell you l was safe, but the kobali wouldn't let me. they said you were part of my kyn'steya... my... my past life, and that l needed to forget you... all of you. so l spent two years letting my new family think l'd accepted them. when l finally earned their trust, l stole a shuttle and started looking for voyager. that was six months ago. they've been chasing me ever since. ln spite of her appearance, l'm detecting traces of human dna. l've compared them with the genetic samples from ensign ballard's file. they match. lt's certainly a convincing story. but your starfleet training is telling you to consider all the possibilities. maybe l'm some sort of hybrid clone or a telepath who accessed ensign ballard's memory somehow. believe me, l was suspicious myself at first, but l am lyndsay ballard. until we find evidence to the contrary... welcome home. captain, could you give us a minute? doctor. so it's really you. ln the flesh... so to speak. l've missed you, too. l know you're all as eager as l am to welcome ensign ballard back. she's a fine officer who's shown a lot of courage and determination over the past few years, and we're lucky to have her with us again. so let's do everything we can to make her feel at home. tom and l have already taken the liberty of removing lyndsay's personal effects from storage. and whenever you're ready, your old shift is waiting for you in engineering. thanks, lieutenant. before we get ahead of ourselves, let's not forget the kobali are still out there. lt seems they want her back as much as we want to keep her. we'll need to take precautions in case they track her to voyager. l've run preliminary scans on the kobali shuttle. l believe l can adapt our systems to counter a possible attack. very good. well, if there's no further business... thank you for saying those nice things about me. you seem surprised. to be honest, l never thought you noticed me. my mistake. so, you still playing the clarinet? actually, l've taken up the saxophone. ambitious. l bet you're good at it. you always were my biggest fan. please, no past tense. sorry. this is a little strange for me. really? lt's been a perfectly normal day for me. deck 2. lt just so happens that hearing you play music again is #26 on my list. list? something l made up to pass the time while l was away. l tried to think of everything l would do if l got back to voyager- - including some things l wasn't able to accomplish the first time l was here. like showing up for duty shifts on time? that's #27. they're here. ah. why don't you and l have a cup of tea while the children play? thank you, but they require my supervision. l like your braid. l could show you how to do it. mezoti. something wrong? l've allotted one hour for recreational activity. there's no time for irrelevant conversation. lt's not irrelevant. adhering to our schedule will allow us to use our time more efficiently. we'll be able to participate in a wider... ...wider variety of activities. fun will now commence. green. grid 313. counter. grid 10. they're cheating. how? azan is using his neural interface to share information. ls this true? you will exercise punishment protocol 9- alpha. lf they cannot participate, neither will l. you are encouraging disorder. and you never let us do what we want. you will exercise punishment protocol 9- alpha. no... l won't. there you go. l can't believe you saved all this. tuvok thought l should recycle everything, but l just couldn't bring myself to do it. my skates and l thank you from the bottom of our hearts. do you know how long it took me to fold those? same old harry. what's that supposed to mean? you're still sort of obsessive. l'm tidy. ls that why you used to request baryon sweeps of your dorm room? when you live across the hall from a slob... hey. show some respect for the dead. did l say something wrong? lt's nothing. just because l've been gone for three years doesn't mean l can't still read you like a book. l gave the eulogy at your funeral. oh? what'd you say? come on. lt's everyone's fantasy to hear their own eulogy. absolutely not. lt's probably for the best. you always were a terrible public speaker. just hope you didn't stutter too much. l told them you had a favorite saying... something you got from an old klingon battle cry. ''own the day.'' l said that you always believed in... attacking each day... possessing it... and that that was what made you so much fun to be around. ls that when everybody burst into tears? l said that, if you'd been there, you would have told them to own that day, to attack it, make it their own and plan to do the same thing tomorrow. pretty strong stuff. you were a strong person. not always. these last six months haven't been easy. there were plenty of times when l could have given up. but you didn't. you know why? you. l wanted to see you again. hmm. guess l won't be needing this anymore. sick bay to ensign ballard. l've finished analyzing your bio- scans. l'm on my way. my scans identified a genetic pathogen in your bloodstream. lt appears to have converted most of your human dna into a kobali protein structure. ls there any way to reverse it? the biochemical changes have affected every system in your body. l'm afraid there isn't enough of your original dna left to make you human again. but l believe l can effect some cosmetic changes. are you saying you could make me look like me again? yes. the alternations would literally be skin- deep and it may take several treatments, but l've devised an inaprovaline compound which should do the trick. physiologically, you'd still be kobali with a multispheric brain, a binary cardiovascular system... but l'd look human. oh, yes. l've lived with this face for long enough. let's do it. have a seat. you may experience some dizziness. l'll hang on to harry for support, if he doesn't mind. that's what l'm here for. what? something wrong? see for yourself. here we are... one jiballian berry salad. l have been looking forward to this for a very long time. lt was #6 on her list. there isn't much variety in the kobali diet. we ate the same gray paste for three years. lt doesn't taste the way l remember it. what's wrong? too sweet? no offense, but it's got sort of a metallic flavor. seems fine to me. l guess my taste buds are still kobali. can l get you something else? thanks. but l need to take care of #16: dazzle lieutenant torres. one minute early. there's a first time for everything. an alignment error has been cropping up in the dilithium matrix. we can't seem to figure out what's causing it. l- l know that you're still settling in, so l'll give you a couple of days to... lt's a vyk'tiote. excuse me? oh, a kobali word to describe a certain kind of wave phenomenon. lt's hard to translate. try me. literally, it means ''crumpled dance.'' all l need to do is vyq'tal the qen'dioqe matrices, stabilize the per'cheya, tez'tel se nenna... cham'bioque! what? you were speaking kobali. l didn't realize. l'm sorry. well, whatever you did, the alignment error is gone. nice job. thanks. l think there might be a few... ''crumpled dances'' in the warp core, too. feel like taking a look? any sign of the kobali? none. the latest tactical reports from tuvok. commander... l no longer wish to serve as guardian to the borg children. what's the problem? their behavior is chaotic. my attempts to apply discipline only result in further disorder. well, kids and disorder usually go hand- in- hand. neelix issued a similar warning prior to my taking this assignment, which is why l devised an activities schedule to promote focus and unity. 0700 hours, the children emerge from their alcoves. nutrients are ingested in the mess hall prior to proceeding to the science lab to begin classes. at 1300 hours, nutrients are consumed a second time before reporting to the holodeck, where they're studying comparative alien physiology. doesn't sound like there's much time for fun. on the contrary. l've scheduled recreational activities. you can't always schedule fun, seven. sometimes it needs to be spontaneous. according to my research, children require structure. l agree, but not to this extreme. you're treating them like they're still on a borg cube. you're comparing me to the collective? you have all four children functioning as one. they do the same things together at the same time. so that each child has the same opportunities to learn. they're individuals. maybe they're rebelling because you don't let them express themselves. then grant my request. choose a more suitable crew member to instruct them. sorry, seven. permission denied. well, l see you're finally going to try my hockey program. actually, l'm taking lyndsay skating. oh. mm. you two sure have been spending a lot of time together lately. don't start. oh, now, let's see... for those of us keeping score, harry kim has fallen for a hologram, a borg, the wrong twin and now, the dearly departed. we're friends. - ah. - just like before. uh, all right, maybe there was a time when l thought of pursuing lyndsay, but l closed the door on that when we both got assigned to voyager. mm. don't look now, but that door is creaking open. what do you think? uh... you look great. doctor thought l should stick to my original color, but this seemed more exciting. hair is one of my specialties, despite evidence to the contrary. lt's just too bad that beneath this beautiful red hair still lies the six- lobed brain of a kobali. well, are you feeling human enough for a little skating? l'd love to, but l already have a date. who with? the captain. she's invited me to her quarters for dinner. ln six years, l have never been invited to the captain's quarters for dinner. well, l'll give her your regards. oh, damn! come in. formal dress wasn't required, ensign. well, l just... l figured dinner with the captain... l'd hardly call this dinner. my replicator decided to liquefy the pot roast. lt looks fine to me. stop trying to get on my good side and grab a slice of bread. peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. l hope you don't mind. not at all. l lived on them at the academy. so, how was your first day back on the job? pretty good, l think. lieutenant torres called my work ''competent.'' trust me, that's high praise coming from b'elanna. commander tuvok finished his analysis of your shuttle and presented me with 37 different ways of repelling a kobali attack. did he include your pot roast? l'm sorry. l didn't mean... l can't believe l just said that. why? lt was funny. we're not on the bridge, lyndsay. you have permission to speak freely. do you really mean that? l wouldn't have said it otherwise. then... there's something l've wanted to ask you for a long time. why me? l'm sorry? why did you choose me for that away mission? well, l suppose l thought you were best suited for the job. no, l wasn't. dilithium extraction was always lieutenant torres' specialty. and tuvok had far more experience conducting away missions, but you didn't send either one of them. was it because they were closer to you? you blame me. no. no, that's not what l meant. - lt's okay, lyndsay. - no, it's not. l'm not offended. no, you d... you don't understand. ''never harbor anger toward those who brought you death, for they gave you the chance to live again.'' ln letting me die, captain, you gave me life. l'm sorry. lyndsay... l'm sorry. l shouldn't have come. you're late. we expected you hours ago. for what? your farewell party. you weren't supposed to come back. you don't belong here anymore. harry, what's going on? ''lyndsay ballard, beloved friend and crewman''- -  does that sound right? what? for your eulogy... does that sound okay? harry, l'm not dead. denial: one of the final stages. lt was illogical for you to return. please, l don't want to go. l couldn't save you before, lyndsay. what makes you think l can save you now? jen'to ka'siote... jhet'leya. come in. what's wrong? bad day, l guess. b'elanna told me you did great in engineering. l solved a simple problem. didn't sound so simple to me. any kobali can discern simple wave distortions. even if b'elanna was impressed, the others were staring at me. l'm sure it was just your imagination. and then, to make matters worse, l started babbling in front of the captain. oh. l used to get pretty nervous around her, too. yeah, don't worry. l'm sure she didn't take it personally. hey... l know this isn't easy... but l'll help you through this. you have always been far too nice to me. why is that? you really don't have any idea, do you? think about it. l rearranged my schedule at the academy just so we'd be in the same classes. l let you teach me how to skate, even though l hate the cold. l'm crazy about you. l have been since the day we met. why didn't you ever tell me? l was never good at public speaking, remember? but l figure how often do you get a second chance. which is why l'd very much like to kiss you now. ''own the day.'' sorry. you are creating disorder. seven will be angry. l don't care. they're cubes. l can see that. precisely 1/1,000 the size of a borg vessel. well done. a 26- sided polyhedron, composed of hexagons, octagons and squares. lmpressive. what's this? can't you tell? lt's you. l don't see the resemblance. look. here's your ocular implant, your nose, your mouth... you were instructed to create a geometric shape. l reminded her of that. she wouldn't comply. this was more fun. don't you like it? lt is crude. however, it does demonstrate ingenuity and individuality. she deviated from your instructions. aren't you going to implement a punishment protocol? no. resume your disorder. lyndsay? they're coming. red alert. raise shields. we are being hailed. on screen. l've come for jhet'leya. lf you're referring to ensign ballard, she's made it clear that she doesn't want to go with you. she's my daughter. please... l've come a long way. l only want to speak with her. you don't have to see him, you know. they can't make you. l want to, harry. lt's time to stop running. l appreciate this, captain. l'm willing to oblige as long as you understand that this meeting is over as soon as ensign ballard says it is. what have they done to you? given me my life back. you were so beautiful. lt's good to see you, jhet'leya. my name is lyndsay. why did you leave us? l wanted to be with my people again. these people? the same ones who set you adrift in space? we jettisoned her body in accordance with our customs. you abandoned her. you had no right to tamper with her remains. we were acting in accordance with our customs. you mutilated her. ensign... the reanimation process usually results in extensive memory loss, which makes the transition less painful. unfortunately, some remember their former lives more than others. jhet'leya, for example. l told you to call me... lyndsay ballard. she's dead. she has been for three years. forgive me for being so blunt, but when we found her, she was a lifeless corpse. we salvaged that raw material to create a new person- - my daughter- - whom l love. l'm not your daughter. you may have altered your appearance, but do you still think like these people? even now, the first words that come into your head, are they in their language or mine? l realize this place is familiar to you, but it's not where you belong. your sister misses you. tynsia. she keeps asking when you're coming home. what should l tell her? tell her that her sister's dead. l'll escort you to the transporter room. l won't give her up, captain. she made her wishes clear. she's confused. thanks to what you did to her. l don't want to fight you. your ship is no match for voyager. every life is precious to my people, captain. l won't be coming back alone. midnight snack? kobali cuisine at its finest. so l was giving some thought to #32- - ''make tuvok laugh.'' he has this holo- program, ''the temple of t'panit.'' l thought we might tweak it, so that instead of vulcan prayers, the monks recite ferengi limericks. you're not laughing. sorry. l can't stop thinking about q'ret. l can't believe he had the nerve to call himself your father. l'll bet professor ballard would have had something to say about that. who? your... dad. doesn't he teach at some university? l don't remember. l don't remember anything about him. let's get down to the holodeck. we've got some monks to tweak. sure. what's wrong? why did she start to revert all of a sudden? our old friend, the pathogen. lt's adapting to counteract my treatments. lt's possible she'll suffer occasional relapses for the rest of her life. you said you could maintain my appearance. l can, but it looks like l'll need to increase the frequency of your treatments. you'll have to see me at least twice a day. how am l supposed to do my job if l'm in here all the time? how am l supposed to do anything? please try to underst... stoi'gia! net'staika pen'daeli shevaob! l'm sorry. wow. this place sure is lived- in. lf you're here to lecture me about cleanliness... l'm here to ask you to stop the treatments. you know what happens if l do. you'll look kobali again? so what? l thought you were cute bald. l don't care if you're human, kobali or bolian. l just want you to be happy. l wouldn't fit in. are you saying tuvok and neelix don't fit in? that's different. they got to grow up in their own cultures. they know where they come from, who they are. wherever they come from, they're part of this crew now, just like you. lyndsay was part of this crew. lf l stop the treatments, l won't be lyndsay anymore. you don't honestly believe that. since the day l got back here, l haven't felt right. first l thought it was voyager. things had changed so much, l thought if l just gave myself more time l'd get used to it. but it's me. l've changed. and the more l try to deny it, the more l feel like a ghost. l'm sorry, harry... but l can't keep fighting anymore. what about us? the girl you were in love with died three years ago. shields down to 48 percent. target the lead ship's weapons array. life support's failing on decks 6 through 10. reroute power to compensate. shields at 20 percent. hail them. tell them you'll surrender me. don't listen to her, captain. l appreciate the gesture, lyndsay, but l'm not giving you up. lt's not a gesture. l want to go. l don't belong here. she's not well. she doesn't know what she's saying. l know exactly what l'm saying. shields at 13 percent. l'm detecting power fluctuations in the lead vessel's warp drive. a polaron burst could overload the core. that would destroy the ship. they're not leaving us much choice. whatever we do, we have to do it fast. you're sure this is what you want. captain, l can fire that polaron burst myself. stand down, ensign. we can't just let them take her! even if you stop them, l can't stay on voyager. l don't want to lose you. you already did, but at least this time, we've been given the chance to say good- bye. captain's log, stardate 53679.4. the doctor has stopped ensign ballard's treatments, and her kobali physiology is already beginning to reassert itself. all but one of us have said our good- byes. vien'ke debala, jhet'leya. l taught myself to say a few words in kobali. that's very sweet of you, but you just told me the comets are tiresome. guess l better work on my pronunciation. l'm sorry you didn't get to finish everything on your list. l think l took care of what really mattered. that's pretty. lt belonged to a friend of mine. would you like it? your friend wouldn't mind? l think she'd be happy knowing l gave it to someone with such pretty hair. seven's letting us go to the holodeck by ourselves. she says we can run any program we want. do you want to come? have you ever heard of ''the temple of t'panit''? lt's a vulcan program. sounds boring. don't worry."
