==Plot==
An employee of the ''Tales from the Crypt'' comic named [[Jim Korman]] (Harry Anderson) is put-upon by his [[Mildred Korman|shrewish wife]] (Colleen Camp) to take potent fertility pills. After a series of weird and bizarre monster attacks, [[Lorelei Phelps|an attractive policewoman]] (Cynthia Gibb) interrogates the cartoonist, believing that he is somehow making his stories come true. The cartoonist must figure out the cause of the threat while also struggling with his own personal feelings for the policewoman.

==Summary==
[[Jim Korman]] is a successful comic artist, but was married to [[Mildred Korman|Mildred]], an extremely overbearing and very jealous woman. She was such an unpleasant person that Jim's colleagues actively avoided her, quickly disappearing into their offices when she visited. Mildred believed that Jim was actively pursuing his female colleagues, viewed his job with contempt, and also was angry that he hadn't gotten her pregnant yet. She forces him to take some experimental fertility pills, and they were revealed to have major side effects. The pills seemed to give him creative highs and allowed him to quickly draw very impressive monster pictures--after taking one, he went from struggling with his latest comic to easily drawing a reptilian monster attacking a man.

That night, Jim briefly flirted with a young woman he saw at the laundromat. This woman, [[Lorelei Phelps]], was reading a romance novel after Jim left, but was surprised by an electric outage and was attacked by a rapist. She revealed herself to her attacker as a policewoman and used her martial arts skills against him, but he was not intimidated. However, the reptilian monster Jim drew suddenly made its way out of one of the washing machines and attacked her rapist, easily killing him by biting his head off. Due to this, Lorelei was able to escape and alert police, who clearly did not buy her story. However, after noticing Jim's drawing appear in the next issue of Tales from the Crypt, Lorelei realizes that it matches the monster she saw. In fact, drawings in several other Tales from the Crypt issues match other monster sightings known to the police. Noting the author's name, Lorelei decides to meet with him.

Later that evening, as Jim leaves the office and gets in his car, he is startled to find Lorelei in the backseat. He's skeptical at her theory that his drawings are connected to the monster sightings, but as an experiment he agrees to draw a new monster. While he and Lorelei are in the office together, they resume flirting, and Jim mentions a willingness to give up monster comics and begin drawing romance instead. His latest drawing does indeed come to life, appearing in an alley and terrifying a group of children.

Jim is clearly smitten with Lorelei and begins drawing pictures of the two of them having dinner together, and later arranges a romantic dinner date. Unfortunately for Jim, Mildred overheard their phone conversation and angrily confronts him. She storms out of the office, and an agitated Jim vents by drawing [[Mildred|a hideous version of his wife]]. Mildred reenters the office with a gun, and, to Jim's horror, threatens to kill him. Luckily for him, he is saved by the monster version of Mildred he had just drawn. It came to life just like his previous drawings had, and when Mildred makes the fatal mistake of insulting its appearance the monster attacks her. Jim pulls his pill out his pocket. he throw the pill in the trash. As the two fight, Jim is able to escape and meets Lorelei, who had just arrived. During their date, when she asked if he was married he replied ""not anymore"", as Mildred was clearly killed by the monster, evidenced by the blood on the carpet.

[[Commander]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] has assigned me to investigate an unusual [[particle field]] detected on the other side of the [[Bajoran wormhole|wormhole]]. [[Odo]] has come along to the [[Gamma Quadrant]] hoping to find clues to his origin.''""  When [[Jadzia Dax|Dax]] and Odo investigate the particle field on a nearby [[planet]], Dax detects [[omicron particle]]s isolated in a small valley. These particles are very rare, and they appear to be interfering with other [[scan]]s, so the pair [[beam]]s down to the planet. Once on the planet, they find a small [[village]], and with their limited [[tricorder]] functions determine the source to be some sort of reactor at the center of the village. Odo suggests they leave, but Dax insists on scanning it in more detail, and they are discovered by [[Protector]] [[Colyus]] who is brandishing a weapon.  ===Act One=== Meanwhile, on [[Deep Space 9]], [[Major]] [[Kira Nerys]] keeps her eye on [[Quark]] and stops his [[cousin]] [[Kono]] from smuggling stolen merchandise from a [[museum]] on [[Cardassia V]] onto the station. Commander Sisko also talks to his son [[Jake Sisko|Jake]] about getting a job. He eventually talks Jake into becoming [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien]]'s apprentice, saying it would look great on his entrance request to [[Starfleet Academy]]. However, Jake seems to do it because he has to rather than because he wants to.  Back on the planet, Colyus interrogates Dax and Odo. They both insist they have committed no crime and had just arrived. Odo demonstrates their innocence by temporarily beaming himself back to the [[runabout]], saying if they wanted to escape capture, they would have already. They convince the Protector they did nothing, leaving Colyus disappointed; the Starfleet officers had been his last possible suspects in twenty-two unsolved disappearances occurring over a period of months. Odo offers his assistance as an investigator.  The first-person Dax and Odo talk to is [[Rurigan]], the elder of the village. He confirms that [[Anetra|his daughter]] was the latest victim to disappear. After Dax scans for [[EM]] traces and detects nothing, Odo talks to [[Taya]], Rurigan's granddaughter. She shies away from Odo and won't talk to him because she believes her mother will eventually come back. Rurigan says the questions from Odo can wait until morning.  ===Act Two=== On the station, Commander Sisko sends Jake off on his first day on the job with O'Brien, giving him a [[combadge]]. Meanwhile, Major Kira talks to [[Doctor]] [[Julian Bashir]] about spying on Quark. She wants to make sure Quark isn't up to something while Odo is away. Bashir is happy to do it, since [[Elim Garak|Garak]] has been teaching him surveillance techniques. Just then, Kira is informed by Sisko that [[Vedek]] [[Bareil Antos|Bareil's]] [[Bajoran Antares transport 002|ship]] has just docked for an unannounced visit to the station.   Continuing his investigation the following day, Odo tries talking to Taya again. She still seems uncomfortable discussing the subject of her mother's disappearance, asking instead what happened to Odo's face. He explains that he is a [[shapeshifter]], which she immediately understands by the term [[Changeling]]. Taya maintains that Changelings are make believe but speaks wistfully about being one. When Taya concludes that everyone would want to be her friend if she were a Changeling, Odo assures her that it is not easy. With uncharacteristic detail, Odo shares his experiences from his early years after he was discovered, when people befriended him just so they could see him change into various items. Revealing the beginnings of a friendship, Taya offers that while others may have been afraid of him, she is not afraid. Inquiring about Odo's parents, Taya then brings up her parents. She reveals that her father died when she was four, and that the last time she saw her mother, she was in her workroom making a pot for the village's baker, Mister [[Depnen]]. When she went to get her for the midday meal, Taya continues, her mother had vanished. Probing further, Odo asks how her mother was acting, or whether she had been on a trip or vacation. Taya replies with confusion that no, no one ever left the valley. Odo seems intrigued, and when Taya morosely asks if her mother is ever coming back, Odo assures warmly, ""''I promise you, I'm going to do everything I can to find her and bring her back to you.''""  ===Act Three=== Back on the station, Jake is having trouble identifying [[isolinear rod]]s with O'Brien at a table in the [[replimat]]. When he continues to be baffled, the chief reassures him he didn't even get this stuff until after his Academy training, drawing a sigh from Jake. Jake explains that he doesn't want to go to Starfleet Academy, but that he can't tell his dad. Understanding Jake's quandary, O'Brien shares how he had almost become a [[cello]] player as [[Michael O'Brien|his father]] wanted. His father went so far as to send a recorded audition to the [[Aldebaran Music Academy]]. Two days before he was set to depart for music school, O'Brien enlisted in Starfleet. However, as O'Brien explains, his father eventually came around, and is even proud to introduce his as ""''My son, Senior Chief Specialist Miles Edward O'Brien.''"" If Jake's father is anything like his was, O'Brien explains, he will understand.   Also on the station, Bareil and Kira exit the shrine, arguing about the merits of the Vedek's speech. After some playful banter, they discover a mutual enjoyment of [[springball]] and leave to engage in a match using the [[holoprogram]] Kira had O'Brien create for her.  Back in the [[Yaderan]] settlement, the investigation continues. Odo interrogates Rurigan, asking him why he seems unconcerned despite his daughter being among the missing. The old man responds that there is nothing he can do about it. Odo points out the pain in his eyes. Rurigan states he is dying, but he has had a good life and only wishes he could have seen his daughter one more time. Odo presses Rurigan, asking him specifically why no one leaves the village, not even to look for the missing villagers. Rurigan only insists cryptically that he is certain there are no missing people out there.   Later, Dax, Odo, and Taya climb a hillside outside the village, with the little girl telling them a story about a [[fictional changeling 001|foolish Changeling]]. Odo engages the child in the story with friendly banter. As they continue to get further from the village, Taya shows them a tree where she and her friends go out and play sometimes. Odo tells her to wait there while he takes Dax further out. As she continues walking, the scanner vanishes in her hand. When Taya starts moving toward them, Odo tells her to stop, but she tries to hand some berries to him, and the end of her arm disappears. It reappears when she pulls it back to her. Now, the nature of their village is clearer to Dax and Odo.  ===Act Four=== They return to the center of the city and bring Colyus to the reactor. Dax explains she knows what happened to the people. After being able to use a console to make his cloak disappear and then reappear, she explains the situation. It's not a reactor; it's a [[hologenerator]]. It creates an omicron field and manipulates it to create matter. Everything in this village, his cloak, and the people, are made up of these particles. The component that controls the field is breaking down, and people are subsequently being lost.  Colyus can't believe it, sure he's not a holographic projection. Odo explains what happened to Taya's arm. Colyus insists he needs more proof before he believes he and his loved ones are holograms. To prove it, Odo and Dax agree to take anyone interested to the edge of the valley.  Back on the station, Vedek Bareil and Kira enjoy dinner after their [[springball]] match, during which Kira was victorious. Their conversation turns intimate as they begin to acknowledge their attraction to one another. Soon they are kissing when Bareil mentions in passing about how [[Prylar]] [[Rhit]], the man who invited him to the station, had a sizable gambling debt to Quark. She suddenly bolts for the door, leaving Bareil confused. Kira, however, is convinced she knows the real reason why Bareil was invited here.  On the planet, the villagers are gathered together after seeing the vanishing effects at the edge of the field. Back in the [[village square]], many believe it is a trick. Colyus says it is because they were programmed not to want to leave. He says the only alternative to having everyone disappear one at a time is to let Dax turn off the machine and fix it. However, if she can't, the whole village will soon cease to exist. After some murmuring, at the suggestion of Rurigan, they agree to let Dax shut it off.  Once it is disabled, the people, the buildings, everything disappears; everything except Rurigan, who tells the two surprised officers that he's as flesh and blood as they are.   ===Act Five=== He explains he lived on [[Yadera Prime]], with all of the people there, but after the planet was conquered by the [[Dominion]], it changed their whole way of life and he decided to leave. He came here and set up this hologenerator, recreating the village with all his friends. He has been living among these people for [[2340|30 years]], sometimes even forgetting they were holograms. He wants them to take him back to Yadera Prime.  Odo wants to know what will happen to the people in the village. While they may not be real the way biological life forms are real, perhaps they are worth keeping alive, since they appear to think, feel, and reproduce. Rurigan is also betrayed by his emotions; they are real to him, since he didn't want his granddaughter to get hurt, and he cares about them. After such a rousing speech by Odo, bringing him to tears since he does love his granddaughter, he agrees not to turn his back on them.  Back on the station, Jake finally sits down and admits to his father he doesn't want to go to Starfleet. He wants to do something that is like he is, not like his father is. Benjamin understands and simply asks Jake to find something he loves and to do it as best he can.  Kira confronts Quark, telling him that his cousin Kono was caught trying to slip onto the station with the stolen museum exhibits. Although it is clear that he tried to distract her by suggesting Bareil be invited to the station, unfortunately there's no evidence linking Quark to his cousin's crime. Although Quark won't admit anything, Kira thanks him for arranging Bareil's visit saying it was certainly distracting. Quark privately curses that it wasn't distracting enough.  Dax fixes the machine, and Rurigan makes one last request: don't tell the holograms he isn't one. After agreeing, she turns it back on, and everything is restored, including the missing people. Colyus wonders who created all this, and Odo simply says that whoever they were, they did a fine job.  Taya says goodbye, and Odo turns into a spinning top to amuse her, just before he and Dax beam up.   "
0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0," == Summary == === Teaser === The {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-D|-D}} encounters an unmanned [[probe]], unarmed, which [[hail]]s [[Captain]] [[Jean-Luc Picard]] by name. The probe projects a [[holographic image]] onto the bridge of [[Bok]], the [[Ferengi]] who [[The Battle (episode)|tried to kill]] Picard [[2364|six years ago]]. The former Ferengi [[DaiMon]] still wants [[revenge]] for the murder of his son, so he tells the captain he will murder his own son, [[Jason Vigo]], to settle the score.   === Act One ===  Picard is stunned. He orders [[Lieutenant]] [[Worf]] to put a [[tractor beam]] on the probe and has [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Data]] start searching [[Federation]] records for Jason, starting with [[Miranda Vigo]]. He also has [[Commander]] [[William T. Riker]] find out why Bok is apparently wearing a DaiMon's uniform and how he could have possibly regained his rank. Riker soon reports the [[Ferengi government]] is busy debating an [[amendment]] to the [[Rules of Acquisition]] so it could be a while before they hear from them. He also reports that Data has found Miranda and she does have a son named Jason. He is now [[2347|23 years old]], and he and his mother left [[Earth]] [[2358|twelve years ago]] and settled on [[Camor V]]. Riker does not ask, but Picard answers the question: yes, he was involved with his mother in a short, but very romantic relationship [[2346|twenty-four years ago]] while on Earth for [[shore leave]]. She never said anything about being [[pregnancy|pregnant]] so Bok is either wrong, or Miranda decided to raise the child alone, which wouldn't surprise Picard as he described her as being very independent and very strong willed. Nonetheless, Jason is in danger and Picard has no doubt Bok will try to make good on his threat against the boy.  Once in [[orbit]] of the [[Camor system]], Data can find no more information; their records are scattered at best. He scans for [[Human]] [[life sign]]s on the southern continent, and finds eight [[Human]]s, including a male below the surface between 20 and 30 years old. When Worf detects seismic activity, Picard has him beam the boy out of there. When he meets Captain Picard, he doesn't know who he is, and doesn't recognize him. After confirming he is in fact Jason Vigo, Picard slowly explains the situation, and Jason submits to a genetic test. [[Dr.]] [[Beverly Crusher|Crusher]] runs the test and confirms her results &ndash; Captain Picard is indeed his father.  === Act Two === In the captain's [[quarters]], Jason looks at the items found on Picard's desk and examines a rare [[Gorlan prayer stick]]. He asks Picard if it is of any value. Picard says not really but to students of [[archaeology]] such as himself, it is. He tells Jason he had to hand over a very old bottle of [[Saurian brandy]] to acquire it. Jason tells him he probably got taken. Picard then tries to talk to Jason like a father, but Jason does not seem interested in having one. He considers Picard to be annoying and is somewhat resentful. He doesn't want to get to know his newfound father. Jason would rather be returned to the surface, but Picard believes that would be unwise until they have located Bok. Jason reluctantly agrees to stay on the ''Enterprise'' and Picard arranges for him to have quarters.  Data, meanwhile, has been analyzing the probe. Bok has encrypted the probe's [[navigation]]al systems, making them unable to determine where it came from. Fortunately, with the help of [[Geordi La Forge]], they have determined several environmental conditions its [[hull]] has been exposed to. This still leaves a wide range of trajectories, but they continue to work on it.  A transmission from DaiMon [[Birta]] on the [[Ferenginar|Ferengi homeworld]] soon arrives, and Birta explains that Bok was relieved of command six years ago for being too unstable and dangerous and was sent to [[Rog Prison]], from which he bought his way out [[2368|two years ago]]. The last they knew, he was somewhere in the [[Dorias Cluster]], an area composed of more than twenty [[star system]]s. Fortunately, given the conditions the probe suffered, La Forge and Data manage to plot its trajectory to the [[Xendi Sabu system]], where it was launched. Picard sets a course immediately.  While en route, he talks with Doctor Crusher about the barriers Jason is putting up. He doesn't want to force anything on him. Crusher asks Picard to keep in mind that Jason has had twenty years to be angry with his father for not being there for him. Crusher does believe it's possible Jason can get over these feelings, but Picard can't just leave Jason alone. At the same time, [[Counselor]] [[Deanna Troi]] talks to Jason in his assigned quarters, but it is clear he is more interested in her than the subject of meeting his father and the death threat against him from Bok. It is a very short discussion, but Jason would rather flirt with her than just talk to her. Troi leaves soon after and tells him he is more than welcome to drop by her [[counselor's office|office]] and schedule an appointment. Jason suggestively tells her he'll do that and Troi leaves as soon as she can.  When the ''Enterprise'' drops out of [[warp]], Picard is awakened by Bok's voice while asleep in his quarters. He suddenly opens his eyes to find Bok standing in front of him. After repeating his threat, Picard calls for security, but Bok is gone a split second later.  === Act Three === La Forge and Worf don't find anything at first. They can tell it's not a hologram because there was nothing to generate it, and he probably wasn't being [[thought maker|mind controlled]] again, as that device emanated a very specific energy signature. Soon after, Data informs Picard of Jason's [[police record|criminal record]]: dozens of minor [[crime]]s, such as [[trespassing]], which is related to his [[rock climbing]] activities. Data notes the embarrassed look on Picard's face and reminds him that this was the information he had requested. Picard thanks Data and walks away.  In [[Ten Forward]], Jason asks the guards assigned to watch him, [[Lieutenant]] [[Sandra Rhodes|Rhodes]] and [[Crewman]] [[Garvey]], to back off, and, after they move away towards the entrance, hides a sudden tremor. Picard soon arrives and tries to get Jason interested with rock climbing on the [[holodeck]], but Jason pushes him away. He says he will leave after Bok has been caught, and he sees no point in them getting acquainted.  :""''[[Captain's log]], [[Stardate]] 47829.1. We've been in the Xendi Sabu system for over three hours and still no sign of Bok.''""  Suddenly, Worf detects another probe approaching the ''Enterprise''. Soon, it explodes, causing no damage since the [[shields]] are up. As part of the explosion, there is a particular series of flashes, which Data sees is a message in [[B'Zal]], a Ferengi code. Once deciphered by Data, it says ""''My revenge is at hand.''""  Picard returns to his [[captain's ready room|ready room]], quite agitated. He orders a cup of [[Earl Grey tea]] from his [[replicator]] and soon Bok appears sitting in his chair. Picard tries to negotiate with him, saying he didn't know he was in [[Ferengi space]] when his son attacked the {{USS|Stargazer|NCC-2893}}, and would have withdrawn if Bok's son had told him that he was. But Bok simply wants payment for his son's life; his feelings about the matter are none of his concern and beams away.  Just then, Lieutenant Rhodes calls Dr. Crusher to Jason's quarters, where she and [[Martinez]] find him experiencing a [[seizure]] without warning.  === Act Four === In [[sickbay]], Crusher examines him, and finds it is [[Forrester-Trent syndrome]], a rare neurological condition. The best she can do is halt the degeneration. She also plans to run a [[microcellular scan]] in case it was caused by a random [[mutation]].  After Jason leaves, Picard admits Crusher was right; he convinced himself that Jason didn't want to reach out to him. But he wishes he was part of his life, and Jason might not have a criminal record if he were there. Dr. Crusher simply advises him the best tool of a parent is patience, and that he should use the time he has well.  Picard returns to his ready room to find Data and La Forge scanning his chair behind the [[desk]]. They have found that it resonates with a particular [[subspace signature]]. They believe it is from a [[subspace transporter]], a technology that the Federation abandoned researching after it was considered both too unreliable and [[energy]]-intensive. Data believes that they can trace the transporter signal if Bok uses it again, but Picard is more interested in Bok's ability to kidnap Jason. La Forge hypothesizes that they could hold Jason on the ship by tying the transporters to the [[subspace field coil]]s, and he tells them to make it so.  Once they are gone, Picard decides to check up on Jason. He finds him in [[Holodeck]] 4, rock climbing. After telling Garvey and Rhodes to wait outside, he climbs up onto the same ledge Jason is on. On the rocks, they start having a better conversation than the ones they had had previously. Picard asks what happened to Jason's mother, and Jason tells him about how she heard about all the children on Camor V who became [[orphan]]ed from the [[Federation-Cardassian War|Cardassian war]], and how they didn't have anybody to take care of them, so she found a large house on the planet she could use and sheltered around forty children. Calling it a ""school,"" she taught them reading, vegetable growing, and singing. She worked tirelessly for them, and made sure they became tough enough to survive. One day, she was attacked by two men in the street for the food she was carrying, and since she wouldn't give it up, they killed her. Jason is obviously shaken up while recalling the story. Picard asks how he can be a father to him, since he and [[Maurice Picard|his own father]] were estranged. Jason still doesn't want to be his son, and tries to push him away by telling him of his criminal behavior. It doesn't work. Eventually, Jason seems to be willing to accept him. That's when Dr. Crusher calls Picard to sickbay with some news about Jason.  Meanwhile, on the bridge, a signal has been detected; Bok is using his transporter again. He locks on to Jason, and La Forge puts up a fight with ''Enterprise''{{'}}s transporter, but before the captain can rescue Jason, Bok reestablishes his lock, and Jason disappears.  === Act Five === Bok then beams another probe to their location and sends the message that he has Jason and is planning to kill him. Fortunately, Data traces the location of his ship, three hundred billion [[kilometer]]s away. It would take twenty minutes at warp 9 to reach them. Picard asks Data if the modified transporter could create the same effect of Bok's transporters. He says yes, but it would be inadvisable to use that method of travel. That's good enough for Picard, as he brings Data along to the [[transporter room]].   With the modifications in place, the real concern is while he can beam over to the ship, they're not sure how to bring him back. Picard, armed with a [[Type 2 phaser|phaser]], says they'll deal with it when the time comes. The modifications also mean Picard will have a longer than usual transport; Picard indicates he understands, and Data initiates the transporter.   As Jason is negotiating for his life, Picard materializes on Bok's vessel and orders the other Ferengi put down their weapons or he'll kill Bok where he stands. Bok demands that he lower his or he'll kill Jason, but Picard reveals the truth: Jason Vigo is not his son. He knows Bok resequenced Jason's DNA to make it appear that Picard is his father, but the technique he used was flawed, and it gave Jason a neurological disorder. When one of the other Ferengi complains about not getting the [[ransom]], Picard says there never was one; it was only about revenge and reveals the truth about Bok losing his command and how he lied to them in order to help him on his quest for vengeance. With the ''Enterprise'' closing in, Picard promises they won't attack if he lets them go. Bok believes he's [[bluff]]ing, but the captain assures him that they would cripple his ship and leave him there until the Ferengi authorities arrive. He turns to the other Ferengi and tells them their only hope to avoid arrest is to give Bok over to them and explain to them they were deceived. [[Tol]] agrees as they turn on Bok and release Jason.  :""''Captain's log, Stardate 47831.8. At Jason's request, the ''Enterprise'' has returned to Camor V.''""  Jason has decided he will return to Camor V to try to straighten out his life. As a farewell present, he receives the Gorlan prayer stick from Picard that he had looked at earlier and suggests that Picard look him up any time he finds himself in the area.  "

Seeking to keep up the pace, he asks his scientist brother to inject him with an experimental youth serum (if he doesn't, he claims he'll find out which one of them ""reaches the pavement first""). Reluctantly, his brother agrees. The serum works wonders; the old man grows younger by the hour. Unfortunately, it does not stop when he hopes, and the regression continues until he is a toddler. His wife tries to leave him, but his clever brother forces the wife, whom he abhors, to stay and raise him, else she will be cut off from his fortune—and she will receive nothing else. He will take legal action against her and battle her to the death. Now she is stuck. Forever. He reminds her, ""As he grows older, you'll be growing...old."" And he caustically predicts that when his brother does grow old enough, another woman is sure to take him away from her. ""It's not fair, Raymond,"" she shudders to her brother-in-law. ""Everything...is on his side!"" ""Well, you see, Flora?"", Raymond Gordon responds somewhat sarcastically. ""As you get older...see how wise you get?"" "

In the course of the conversation, Kira's informed that Razka has found [[salvage]] from a missing ship called the ''[[Ravinok]]'' &ndash; but that she'll need to come to him in order to see for herself.  === Act One === Later she's reviewing the [[criminal activity report]] with [[Odo]] concerning [[Trelos Vren]] in the [[security office]], but she concedes that her mind is wandering. When she tells him that her thoughts are on the ''Ravinok'', Odo wishes her good luck &ndash; he's certain that while she may be skeptical that there are any survivors, she won't rest until she's certain.   While Kira prepares for her departure from the [[Deep Space 9|station]], [[Captain]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] drops in on her and asks Kira to put off her departure, as the [[Cardassian]]s have asked to send someone along with Kira. She tells Sisko that she'll wait two days, and not a minute more, before she leaves. Sisko tells her he will pass along the message to the Cardassian government   Sometime later, Sisko is in the [[docking ring]] with [[Jadzia Dax]], and they're speculating on the depth of [[Kasidy Yates]]'s interest in the captain. At just that moment, Kasidy walks up to them to announce that she's applied for a ship's captaincy with the [[Bajoran Ministry of Commerce]]. Dax's immediate response is to point out that if Kasidy gets the job she can live on the station, and meanwhile the captain's looking entirely overwhelmed at the prospect.   When Sisko makes it back to Ops, he's told by Worf that the Cardassians want to [[beam]] someone directly into Ops from the transport ''[[Rabol]]'' &ndash; someone who turns out to be [[Dukat]]. It seems that ''he'' is the one who's to accompany Kira on her search for the ''Ravinok'', and he too is anxious to leave.  === Act Two === Aboard the {{USS|Rio Grande}} [[Danube class|runabout]] heading to Razka's location in the [[Badlands]], Dukat inquires on Kira's motivation for the search. She explains that when the ''Ravinok'' was lost, one of the people aboard was [[Lorit Akrem]], the man who recruited Kira into the [[Shakaar resistance cell]]. Dukat's bemused at that, and goes on to say that the Shakaar cell had been the focus of a lot of Cardassian attention during the [[Occupation of Bajor|Occupation]]. Thence he asserts that the Occupation did Bajor a favor, with which Kira hotly disagrees.  Back on the station, Sisko and Kasidy are having dinner in the captain's quarters and Kasidy announces that she got the captaincy she applied for. When she raises the possibility of getting quarters on the station, an increasingly overwhelmed Sisko calls it ""''a big step,''"" Obviously, Kasidy is unimpressed by ''that'' response and declares that Sisko is afraid of commitment. She walks out on him.   When Kira and Dukat arrive at Razka's ship, Dukat's presence creates tension, and it is revealed that both Razka and Dukat are wanted men &ndash; Razka by the Cardassians, and Dukat by the [[Maquis]]. However, Dukat confirms that Razka's salvage is from the ''Ravinok''. Informed that [[Dozaria]] was the last stop of the [[Ferengi]] [[starship|ship]] that was hauling the salvage, Kira and Dukat leave. Once at Dozaria, they find emissions consistent with the presence of a damaged ship, and take the runabout down to the surface of the planet… where they find the hulk of the ''Ravinok''.  === Act Three ===  At the station, Sisko is in the upper level of [[Quark's]] with Dax and [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]], discussing how the captain can best remedy the fact that Kasidy is upset with him. There appear to be a few different ways to go about it. Quark, overhearing, gives his traditional Ferengi input of treating women ""like the enemy."" Once the captain leaves the table with a diplomatic acknowledgement of their advice, Dax and Bashir agree with the captain's judgment that the prospect of Kasidy living on the station is ""''a big step.''""  Back on Dozaria, they find that the ship was shot down. Furthermore, there were survivors, as there are 12 neatly arranged grave sites nearby. Dukat pauses to identify the remains. Kira also helps, but Dukat objects, saying [[funeral]] rites forbid non-Cardassians to view the remains. Kira eventually accepts it and goes to the ship. There, she finds the [[passenger manifest|manifest]] and the fact that the ship was attacked by unidentified ships. Coming back out to inform Dukat, she finds he is holding a [[Bajoran betrothal bracelet]], revealing his incentive for coming there &ndash; a Bajoran woman who was once his beloved {{dis|mistress|lover}} &ndash; ''was''. Dukat doesn't want to dwell on the story, leaving Kira to identify the Bajoran remains. She discovers that Lorit wasn't killed when the ship crashed. Wanting to continue her search for Lorit, Kira explains that as a resistance fighter he had an implanted tracking device of sorts, the trail of which should lead them to the location of the survivors.  That night, Kira and Dukat are setting up their bivouac when Dukat suddenly loses his usual controlled calm and repeatedly shouts ""''I sat on something!''""  Kira looks at his buttocks and removes a long, sharp object. She hands him a [[dermal regenerator]], but he is so agitated that she has to remind him to turn it on. She breaks into laughter at his loss of dignity, and after a few seconds he joins in.  Afterwards, Kira points out that she learned from the ship's computer that the daughter of Dukat's mistress, one [[Tora Ziyal]], was also aboard. Dukat declares that he's the girl's father, and that if he finds her alive, he will be forced to kill her. Kira is shocked.  === Act Four === The next day, Kira berates Dukat for what he's set to do. Dukat goes on to explain to Kira that if his paternity of the girl is made known on [[Cardassia]], his political enemies would see him ruined. Kira is, of course, unfazed by this and suggests relocating her secretly to Bajor. Dukat refuses that kind of life for her or her mother. He also says he sent them away, via the ''Ravinok'', so they could live on [[Lissepia]] for a relatively better life. Kira objects further, saying he could do that again, but he says he and his family would be in more danger now, with his alignment with the unstable civilian government. He warns her not to stand in his way.  Back on the station, Sisko talks with [[Jake Sisko|Jake]], who informs him Kasidy is not taking the job because Sisko didn't want her to. Revealing he has been talking to Nog, he says he should let Kasidy take the job if she really wants it, because it was her decision and Sisko is scared of feeling guilty if things don't work out. He's a little stunned, with all this conversation behind his back.   Kira and Dukat find the survivors of the ''Ravinok'', who have been [[slavery|enslaved]] by the [[Breen]] at a [[dilithium]] [[mining|mine]]. One of the survivors is indeed Tora Ziyal, to Dukat's dismay.  === Act Five === Kira tries to order Dukat back to DS9 for reinforcements, but Dukat refuses and, with Kira also unwilling to leave Dukat alone, suggests a joint plan to infiltrate the mine. Kira bluntly promises him that if he kills his daughter, she will kill him.    Later, they manage to disguise themselves within Breen [[refrigeration suit]]s. Once in the mine, Kira discovers that Lorit is dead. Dukat asks where the girl is, but they are soon under fire. Dukat runs off to find his daughter while Kira returns fire. Chased by Kira, Dukat finds Ziyal retrieving water from a spring. Ziyal immediately recognizes her father, and his response is to draw his [[disruptor]] on her. Just then Kira finds her way into the chamber, and draws ''her'' disruptor on Dukat.  Encouraged by Kira to run, Ziyal instead stands her ground and explains that even though she'd been warned of the likelihood that her father would want to kill her, she refused to believe it &ndash; she maintained her will to live by hoping and actually ''dreaming'' that she'd be ''rescued'' by him. The impasse is finally broken when Ziyal says to her father, ""''if I can't be with you, then I'd rather die''"" &ndash; and he embraces her warmly.   Back on the station, Captain Sisko goes to Kasidy to apologize for his gracelessness, as he'd been advised by [[Jake Sisko|his son]] to do. Kasidy accepts his apology and, though she turns away from his attempt at a parting kiss, implies that the two of them will be seeing a lot more of each other.  Shortly thereafter Dukat catches up to Kira on the [[Promenade]] to announce to her that he's taking Ziyal back to Cardassia, and that he will [[Return to Grace (episode)|let her know]] if he has any trouble over his decision.

An animated black comedy version of the Three Little Pigs story. When [[Dudley Pig|the third pig]] is tried and convicted for the murder of his two brothers by a wolf jury, he builds a zombie Frankenpig to take out his revenge on the actual murderer.

== Summary ==
[[Dudley Pig|Dudley]] (Cam Clarke), [[Drinky Pig|Drinky]] (Brad Garrett), and [[Smokey Pig|Smokey]] (Charlie Adler) are three pig brothers living in retrospective houses. While Dudley's house was  made of brick, in accordance with the traditional ""Three Little Pigs"", Drinky's house was made out of a whiskey keg while Smokey's house was made of cigarettes and match sticks. After their homes are destroyed by the Big Bad Wolf (voiced by Bobcat Goldthwait), Drinky and Smokey seek refugee in Dudley's house. While Dudley provides good hospitality, both his two brothers are proven to be irresponsible due to their common addictions, not to mention failing to find a job, especially for the fact that they don't know how to read.

While Dudley is out getting more beer for Drinky and Smokey, [[The Big Bad Wolf]] tricks Drinky and Smokey into letting him in before he proceeds to violently murder the defenseless little pigs. Upon stumbling into the aftermath of the massacre, a horrified Dudley calls the police, who immediately accuse him of slaughtering his brothers before being tried and found guilty in wolf court.

That night, a depressed Dudley is visited by the ghosts of his deceased brothers who tell him that The Big Bad Wolf is the killer. After escaping with their help, Dudley constructs [[Frankenpig]] (also voiced by Brad Garrett), a huge zombie-like pig and instructs him to find The Big Bad Wolf and kill him.

Frankenpig ambushes the Big Bad Wolf, drunk from drowning his thirst for the pigs, and rips out his insides before eating him whole. When Frankenpig returns to Dudley, he is put down by him. Unfortunately, this allows the Big Bad Wolf to be revived as he proceeds to beat up and eat Dudley alive.  As the story ends, the Big Bad Wolf stops the iris, says that he loves this ending and Dudley is now pork and then eats him alive as it irises out with blood.

When she gets to the party, the others are far worse off, have low-aspiring jobs or 'selling whatever falls out of them' but still mock her, only to be shooed away by [[Adlai Atkins]]. Adlai is the only other successful orphan and Leela had a crush on him in the past. Having become a phaser eye surgeon, Adlai offers to give Leela another eye to make her more normal. Leela accepts, despite [[Philip J. Fry|Fry's]] objections.  Meanwhile, [[Bender]] adopts twelve orphans to get a $100 a week per child government stipend. He abuses his position as their foster parent by telling them to sleep during the daytime and starving them.

He and the [[Planet Express Crew]] journey to his castle in [[Thermostadt]] for his funeral and the reading of the will. After a short service, they encase Vladimir's chassis in a box filled with Styrofoam. The next day, the lawyer reads the will: the butler, [[You There]], gets a very small pittance, his son [[Tandy]] is given his entire ten-million-dollar fortune; Bender, who Vladimir assumes is not responsible for his death, is given the family [[Thermostadt Castle|castle]] under the condition that he spends one night within its walls.

When he runs away, the Planet Express crew investigates and find out that the poorly protected robots' programming leaked through the castle's wiring, where they could appear as holograms. They try to explain this to Bender, but he runs past them onto the moors, encountering a car that drives on four wheels ''""like a wolf!""''.

The robot there tells them she got the curse from [[Calculon]]. In [[Hollywood]], Calculon confesses he was run over by the original were-car a thousand years ago. He changes his appearance every two decades so no one gets suspicious. When Calculon was a car manufacturing machine, he assisted in creating the evilest of cars: [[Project Satan]].

==Summary==
===Teaser===
[[Captain]] [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]] and a [[landing party]] &ndash; [[Spock]], [[Dr.]] [[Leonard McCoy|McCoy]], {{dis|O'Herlihy|Ensign}}, [[Kelowitz]], and {{dis|Lang|Lieutenant Commander}} &ndash; beam down to the [[Federation]] observation [[outpost]] on [[Cestus III]] at the invitation of its commander, [[Commodore]] [[Travers]], who has received quite the reputation for setting a fine table with [[Travers' personal chef 001|his personal head chef]]. When the away team arrives, they discover that the invitation is a ruse and the [[colony]] has been destroyed.

===Act One===
After the landing party takes cover and Kirk declares [[full alert]], they discover a single [[Human]] survivor in the ruins, [[Lieutenant]] [[Harold]]. Spock quickly locates the presence of other [[lifeform]]s nearby but no other colonial survivors. His [[Starfleet tricorder|tricorder]] reads them as cold-blooded creatures but definitely not Human. O'Herlihy attempts to scout them out, but is immediately disintegrated by an alien weapon as the landing party is bombarded by a massive shelling attack.

At the same time, the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701}} comes under attack in [[orbit]] by an [[Gorn starship|unidentified starship]]. With her [[deflector screen]]s up, the ''Enterprise'' cannot [[beam]] up the landing party. Kirk orders Lieutenant [[Hikaru Sulu|Sulu]] to return fire with the [[phaser bank]]s, but it has little effect as the alien ship has screens up as well. Kirk orders the use of [[photon torpedo]]es, but the torpedoes are ineffective, as the alien is too far away even for visual contact. The captain orders Sulu to take whatever action is necessary to protect the ''Enterprise'', be it leaving orbit or engaging maximum warp. Sulu opts for the former and takes the ship away from Cestus III.

Kirk makes his way to the colony's arsenal, avoiding large blasts from the unidentified attackers, and retrieves a [[grenade launcher]]. Spock and Kelowitz rendezvous with him as the [[first officer]] reports that the enemy troops are moving towards their location. Kelowitz reports that Lang has been killed (Lang's death in not shown, only mentioned), and gives Kirk his best guess as to where they have moved; Kirk launches the grenade in that direction. The tactic proves successful as the aliens begin to decamp back to their vessel, allowing Sulu to return with the ''Enterprise'' and retrieve the landing party and quickly set a pursuit course of the attacking ship.

In [[sickbay]], Harold tells Kirk and Spock of the attack on the colony. The aliens had knocked out their phasers with their first salvo, leaving the colony defenseless; and confirms Kirk's earlier theory that the aliens had faked the message from the colony, diverting the ''Enterprise'' to Cestus III in an attempt to destroy what was the only protection in that part of the Federation. Such a move, a prelude to invasion, suggests the correct course: overtake and destroy the enemy before he can return to his home base and report. The captain orders the ship to [[battle stations]] and to warp 6 to overtake the aliens. ""''[[Red alert]]. I repeat, red alert. This is no drill,''"" Kirk announces to the crew through the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s [[intercom]]. ""''This is no drill.''""

===Act Two===

The aliens, aware that the ''Enterprise'' is in pursuit, jump to warp 6 as well. Kirk orders warp 7 engaged, drawing concern from Spock and [[chief engineer]] [[Montgomery Scott|Scott]] that a sustained warp 7 speed would be hazardous to the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s warp engines. Spock argues against destroying the enemy vessel on the basis of respect for [[sentient life]]. Kirk disagrees; his opinion is that a [[crime]] has been committed and the perpetrators must be punished. Sulu reports that the aliens have moved to warp 7, as well. Kirk, mulling over his options, orders the ship to accelerate to warp 8 and have all weapons departments at battle ready.

Closing in at warp 8, the ''Enterprise'' records a scanning beam from an uncharted solar system at [[2466 PM]]. The alien is not approaching this system; it appears that a third party is ""curious"" about the ''Enterprise''. The alien abruptly begins to slow, going quickly to sublight speed until finally stopping dead in space. Kirk closes for the kill, but the ''Enterprise'' is soon slowed to sublight, as well, stopped dead like the alien with all power to the engines and weapons simply cut off.

The architects of this reveal themselves: the [[Metron]]s, an advanced race who regard intrusion into their space for the purpose of conflict as entirely unacceptable. They remove Kirk from the ''Enterprise'' along with the [[Gorn]] [[captain]] from the alien vessel and deposit both of them on a suitably prepared world. From there, the two captains will settle their differences, using strength and ingenuity, and the most basic of weapons. The winner and his ship will be free to go; the loser and his ship will be destroyed.

===Act Three===
The [[Gorn captain 1|Gorn captain]] is a green, Human-sized [[reptile|reptilian]] creature, and quite slow compared to Kirk; however, he makes up for this by his superior strength and bulk. Kirk is able to evade him initially, but knows he can't do so indefinitely. He'll have to find a way to defeat his opponent, who is far stronger and tougher, and may have more stamina.

The key may lie in a comment the Metron made, i.e. that the prepared environment around them contains elements suitable for fabricating weapons. Attack and evasion continue for some time, with Kirk narrowly evading death at the Gorn's claws. Back on the ''Enterprise'', the crew is unable to restore power to the engines and the weapons and remains immobilized. The Metrons reestablish communications and inform the crew that Kirk is losing the battle. In view of his impending death, they allow the crew to watch what is happening on the [[viewscreen]].

The Gorn finally communicates: it proposes that Kirk cease trying to evade him, and promises in exchange to be merciful and quick in killing him. Kirk compares this offer to the supposed ""mercy"" that was shown to the Humans at Cestus III; this enrages the Gorn, who tells Kirk his people regard Cestus III as part of their territorial space. From the Gorn perspective, they were repelling an invading force. Watching from the bridge (for the Metrons are now allowing this), McCoy posits that perhaps it was the Humans who were in the wrong. Spock agrees it is possible.

===Act Four===

As the conflict continues, Kirk remembers an old formula: [[gunpowder]]. Using [[sulfur]], [[coal]], [[potassium nitrate]], diamonds, and a bamboo-like plant, Kirk constructs a makeshift [[cannon]]. Spock, impressed by the captain's ingenuity, posits that Kirk might be successful if he can complete construction of the cannon before the Gorn closes in for the kill. Moments from a fatal attack, Kirk rips up his own uniform to make a fuse and uses the metallic [[recording-translating device]] provided by the Metrons to spark the coal, allowing Kirk to touch off his crude device, which incapacitates the Gorn.

Kirk has won the contest, but stops short of delivering the fatal stroke to the Gorn captain. He yells out loud to the unseen Metrons that he won't kill him and that they will have to find their entertainment elsewhere.  The Gorn suddenly disappears, and a Metron representative appears before Kirk on the rocks above him: a tall, youthful-looking blond male in a silver toga, who looks rather like a Greek god. The Metron expresses surprise, saying their analysis did not prepare them for Kirk's demonstration of mercy towards his helpless opponent. The Metron claims to be 1,500 Earth years old and informs Kirk that the Gorn has been returned to his ship. The Metron will destroy him for Kirk, if he so chooses. Kirk declines and claims that the Federation and the Gorn can talk their dispute over and perhaps reach an agreement. This also impresses the Metron, who theorizes that although Humanity is still half-savage, perhaps in several thousand years it will be civilized enough to be of further interest to the Metrons. Kirk is returned to the ''Enterprise'' (he is no longer dusty and dirty from the battle, and his torn uniform is pristine again),  where he discovers that the ship has been relocated five hundred [[parsec]]s away from the Metron solar system.

Talking over the incident with the Gorn captain and the Metrons with Spock, Kirk tells his first officer that ""''We're a most promising species, Mr. Spock, as far as predators go,''"" when Spock asks what happened after Kirk fired off his cannon. Spock remarks that he frequently had his doubts about that, but Kirk informs him that in a thousand years or so, Humanity will be able to prove it to the Metrons. ""''A thousand years, Captain?,''"" Spock inquires. ""''Well, that gives us a ''little'' time,''"" Kirk replies as the ''Enterprise'' heads back to Cestus III.

They are accompanied by Old Ben, a kindly, grandfatherly gentleman, whom the kids adore. When it is Old Ben's turn at bat, he hits the ball in close to his hands, but the ball carries over the fence and out of sight, ending the game. They then decide to play ""Spaceman"", one of their favorite games. Old Ben, who usually plays the spaceman, suggests that Jenny play the visitor from outer space this time. Jenny declines, saying she can't make herself into as convincing a spaceman as Old Ben, so Old Ben assumes his customary role. He runs behind a huge tree to prepare.  When Old Ben emerges (looking like a nightmarish, shelled monster), the children ""zap"" him with pretend guns, and Old Ben fakes his death and stumbles back behind the tree. Old Ben then reappears from behind the tree in human form and announces that the spaceman is gone, and the camera then pans to Rod Serling seated on a park bench as he introduces this episode, noting that it combines science fiction (""the improbable made possible"") with fantasy (""the impossible made probable""). Old Ben carries Jenny home (she walks with a leg brace that restricts her movement), where she lives with her abrasively unsympathetic aunt, Agnes Gann. As they approach the rowhouse, Ben causes his roller skates to dematerialize. This phenomenon is observed by two well-dressed men who are watching the house from across the street.  The two men enter the apartment building and question Agnes about Ben. Agnes is not surprised, assuming the police are interested in Ben. She believes him to be of questionable character. Jenny, who has been sent to bed without supper for spending time with Old Ben, overhears the conversation and limps upstairs to Old Ben's apartment to warn him about the two men. Old Ben lets Jenny in on his secret that he is actually from another planet, a planet Jenny has never heard of, and that his appearance is only a disguise. Old Ben decides it's time for him to ""skedaddle"" again, but before departing he uses a strange device to heal Jenny's leg. The two strangers meet Jenny walking down the stairs without her brace. The plot thickens as the men use a device identical to Old Ben's to make Jenny temporarily deathly ill, forcing Ben to return and save her.  Old Ben comes back to Jenny's room and makes her well again. As she thanks him, she sees the two men watching Old Ben. They begin addressing him as ""Your majesty."" Old Ben explains to Jenny that he is not a criminal but the king of his planet. He grew weary from the pressures of ruling his world, from having so much of his authority overridden by red tape... and by ""the Council"". Accordingly, Ben came to Earth for a self-authorized vacation. The strangers tell Jenny that Old Ben's people love him as much as she does; they want him to return and continue the remainder of his 5,000-year reign. Old Ben knows he must go back to his planet, but regrets that it would be against the rules for Jenny to go with him. Old Ben is granted a moment alone with Jenny to say goodbye after he promises not to run away.  Jenny comes up with a plan that will keep them together. She has Ben change himself into her identical twin. Since Old Ben's subjects are unable to tell them apart, they are forced to return with both of them.  At the end of the episode, host Rod Serling holds up an 8-by-10 black-and-white photograph of a handsome young man, noting that the photo shows Old Ben's true appearance and that when Jenny grows up, she will become his queen.

Two Argrathi enter and tell him that he is now free to go. He claims that he has nowhere to go, but is thrown out of the cell anyway. He suddenly awakens to find [[Major]] [[Kira Nerys|Kira]] looking over him. Kira explains that the Argrathi have implanted a twenty-year prison sentence in his head, and that only a few hours have passed since his conviction. O'Brien sits dazed and tells Kira that being in prison for twenty years feels very real to him.  === Act One === [[Captain]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] explains to [[Keiko O'Brien|Keiko]] that while on a mission to [[Argratha]], O'Brien was falsely accused of [[espionage]] and sentenced to twenty years in prison. However, the [[Argrathi]] are experts at mind-controlling and mind-altering technologies, and their criminal system was able to administer him the experience of twenty years of prison in just a few hours of treatment, without physically harming him. By the time the details of the events had been received by [[Deep Space 9]], the ""sentence"" had already been completed, and he was free to return home. Keiko asks if she can see her husband and Sisko tells her as soon as she gets permission from [[Doctor]] [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]], she certainly can.  O'Brien and Kira arrive at the station, and Doctor Bashir meets them at the [[airlock]]. He promises to do his best to remove the memory implants. He asks O'Brien a bit about the experience, such as if he was alone in his cell. O'Brien says yes, but from a {{dis|flashback|story device}} to his incarceration, it becomes clear that he had a cell mate named [[Ee'char]]. O'Brien remembers the time he met Ee'char in his cell, who helped him by giving him a [[fruit]] called ''[[Chee'lash fruit|chee'lash]]''. They exchange their names, ""crimes"" and sentences. Back in reality, O'Brien affirms to Bashir that he was totally alone.  === Act Two === Bashir soon discovers that the memories of his imprisonment were not simply implanted: he really experienced living in a cell for twenty years, though in his mind at an accelerated rate. Thus, eradication of these memories is out of the question, and he has to accept them. He tells Keiko and she understands. They go in to see O'Brien in the [[infirmary]], who had tried to order the ''chee'lash'' fruit from the replicator. When Keiko enters the room, he first sees Ee'char in her place, but that fades as he holds her and remembers she is [[pregnant]].    O'Brien soon finds he has trouble undoing the habits he had taken up during his incarceration, including saving scraps of food ""for later"" during dinner with his family. A flashback shows Ee'char doing the same thing. O'Brien (who has grown a beard) questions Ee'char on how to cope, and he shows O'Brien how to draw complex patterns in the [[sand]] called ''[[eseeka]]s'' to pass the time. They are told it's time to go to sleep, and then Keiko awakens in the middle of the night to find O'Brien sleeping on the floor.  === Act Three === O'Brien's memories come back to haunt him, and he begins seeing his former simulated cellmate Ee'char walking around the station. He plays [[darts]] with [[Worf]] for a bit in [[Quark's Bar, Grill, Gaming House and Holosuite Arcade|Quark's]], but leaves when he sees Ee'char out on the [[Promenade]].    He also finds it very difficult to readjust to life back on the station. Later, in one of the station's [[cargo bay]]s, [[Jake Sisko|Jake]] helps him remember the names of the various [[tool]]s. O'Brien is determined to get back up to speed immediately and dive into work. He makes some repairs with the crew in a junction of an [[Access tunnel|access conduit]], and [[Enrique Muniz|Muniz]] briefly checks him and has a friendly exchange. O'Brien is friendly, too, but hiding his {{dis|stress|biology}} when Muniz leaves for [[lunch]]. O'Brien hangs back, only to be confronted by Bashir about not having been to [[Counselor]] [[Telnorri]] for the past ten days. O'Brien says he does not want to talk about his life in prison, only to forget it and be left alone. Bashir keeps pushing, and O'Brien snaps at him, storming off.    O'Brien then remembers a time when he reached his limit on staying calm in the cell. He made noise when he banged on the door, objecting to his incarceration but also inviting a threat of retaliation from the guards for the disturbance. Ee'char finally held him down to prevent any actions taken. Later on, he goes to Quark's again and lashes out at him for taking his time to serve him a drink, pinning him by the arm. O'Brien leaves with his drink to a table to be alone, where Ee'char continues to reappear, claiming that in O'Brien's eyes, he was real and always will be. O'Brien tells him to go away, but Ee'char says he can't because he's O'Brien's friend and needs him now more than ever. [[Quark]] then tells [[Odo]] about the incident, and they both observe O'Brien at his table.  === Act Four === O'Brien continues seeing Ee'char, now on his way to work. He says he's worried about O'Brien, but O'Brien insists he is okay, but Ee'char makes the point that O'Brien keeps seeing him. Soon, Sisko calls O'Brien to his office. Hearing about O'Brien's behavior, Sisko relieves him of duty, and orders him to report to the infirmary, and to attend daily counseling sessions. O'Brien tries to ask for another chance, but Sisko tells him he's unfit for duty and if he's doesn't get help, he'll have no choice but to have O'Brien confined to the infirmary.  O'Brien storms out of [[Operations center|Ops]], snapping at [[Jadzia Dax|Dax]] and angrily throws his [[combadge]] at the floor in the [[turbolift]], with Dax looking on, concerned. Then he goes to the infirmary and tells Bashir to leave him alone. Interestingly, Ee'char appears just behind Bashir, and O'Brien snaps directly at the both of them. O'Brien returns to his [[quarters]], but, on the way, Ee'char continues to confront him, saying he can't run from him forever. Furthermore, there's a reason O'Brien can't get rid of him. He returns to his quarters eventually to a worried Keiko. Unfortunately, when Molly pesters him for attention at this moment, he becomes so angry that he gets up and nearly hits her, shocking Keiko. Horrified by what he nearly did, Miles leaves and then goes to a [[cargo bay]] and vents his frustration by smashing a number of storage containers in a rage with a pole. Finally, he spots [[weapons locker]] [[47]] and pulls a [[phaser]] out, deciding to [[Suicide|take his own life]]. Setting the phaser to maximum, he aims it at himself by placing it under his chin.  === Act Five === Bashir arrives and tries to talk O'Brien out of killing himself. O'Brien starts crying and says he cannot go on living when he is a threat to his family and all his friends. The man he was is gone, and all that's left is a dangerous [[monster]]. He confesses his worst crime: after almost twenty years, he found that Ee'char had been hoarding food without telling him, and killed him in a rage &ndash; before he realized that the food was for both of them. O'Brien, an ""evolved"" Human of the [[24th century]], gave into bestial rage and [[murder]]ed his best friend, all for nothing.   Bashir tells him he's wrong; the fact that he feels remorse over killing Ee'char proves that he is still a decent Human being, not a monster. His captors tried to strip away his Humanity; they may have succeeded for a moment, but if O'Brien takes his own life, the Agrathi will have succeeded in destroying a good man. O'Brien lowers the phaser, and Bashir takes it away. Over Bashir's shoulder, O'Brien is surprised to see Ee'char, smiling at him, without reproach. Ee'char tells his friend to ""be well,"" and walks away, disappearing.    Walking O'Brien back to his quarters, Bashir prescribes a medication that will take the edge off his depression and stop him from having any more hallucinations. However, the false memories cannot be removed, and O'Brien will have to come to terms with them on his own. Bashir convinces him to resume counseling sessions, and O'Brien thanks his best friend for all his help.  When he enters his quarters, O'Brien is gratified when Molly runs into his arms, glad to have him back.   "
0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"==Plot== The episode starts on [[Omicron Persei 8]] with [[Lrrr]] watching a commercial for a new show called The Finder Outer. At the end of the commercial, Lrrr's son [[Jrrr]] appears and asks him to help him earn merit badges for his boy scouts. Lrrr initially and selfishly refuses until Ndnd nags him into helping his son. Lrrr and Jrrr then flip through the scout handbook to decide on which badges needed to be claimed but Jrrr is less interested in the badges involving acts of violence and prefers skull arranging, which Lrrr calls ""girly"" and flips the book to planetary invasion and decides to force his son to invade earth, which is what he calls ""the easiest planet to invade'. Meanwhile, The Professor announces that he's in terrible pain because of his arthritis. He tells the crew that he ran out of his medication which explains his arthritis pain. Lrrr then takes his son to Earth and drops him off at the [[White House]] with [[Richard M. Nixon's head]] and the [[Headless Body of Spiro Agnew]] answering the door. Jrrr tries to make the traditional Omicronial invasion address but messes it up and his father loses patience with it, Zapp Branigan and Nixon are both forced to sign a document that makes Jrrr the ruler of Earth. Lrrr begins telling Jrrr to shoot something so Jrrr could earn his badge and go back home so Lrrr can go home to catch the Finder Outer. Jrrr tries to find something to shoot at but he accidentally pulls the trigger while in the midst of deciding what to shoot and the laser hits and disintegrates Agnew, enraging Nixon.  Lrrr see's on TV Nixon's address which he learns that all ties with Omicron Persei 8 will be cut including all TV Channels being broadcasted to Omicron Persei 8. The Planet Express team see's Nixon's address and are relieved they don't have to go to Omicron Persei 8 any more.The Professor then announces that the crew must get an important ingredient for his medicine, which is a herb that only grows on Omicron Persei 8. Hermes refuses to get the team to Omicron Persei 8, but after discovering the ingredient is actually Omicronian Marijuana. Immediately, Hermes joins the crew on the trip. The crew then go to that planet and easily get there by fooling Zapp Brannigan into thinking of the Planet Express ship as an Omicronian delivery ship by spraying Omicronian Express on the ship. While on the planet, the crew is ordered to go into groups.  they all go out  to look for the herbs and they discover that the herb is bioluminescent when near Bender because of his electromagnetic field. While looking for more of the herbs Fry gets distracted and wanders off from the Crew. The crew soon escapes the planet in fear of getting caught and accidentally leave Fry behind. Fry then attempts to make his way towards safety but ends up in the garden shed on Lrrr's palace.  Meanwhile, Lrrr is still watching TV and Jrrr comes out and asks his father to play with him but is coldly shrugged off.  Jrrr then heads outside and notices something moving in the garden shed. He leaves a trail of what is seemingly candy to lure Fry out of the shed and Fry falls for it, eating the candy before waking up Jrrr. Both of them initially get scared of one another but calm down. Jrrr then tells fry that the ""candy"" Fry was eating was his excrement, grossing out Fry at first but he still continues to eat it.  Jrrr then leads Fry into the palace and tells him of his struggles of getting along with his father, who he thinks of as a terrible and selfish father as well as an incompetent ruler. Jrrr then shows Fry a weapon called a fleem, which Fry plays with, causing him to bring back memories of Bender, saddening him. Meanwhile on Earth, Bender has trouble dealing with Fry not being around anymore. Leela then knocks on the apartment door and Bender tries to cover up Fry's disappearance by using the  answering machine's message on it to make it seem like Fry was preoccupied with getting drunk.    Fry and Jrrr try to figure out how to get Fry home with Jrrr mentioning that the phone line connecting Omicron Persei 8 with Earth being cut off due to orders from Nixon. They go by flying bicycle to a junkyard where they use the junk there to form the SOS message. Meanwhile, Bender has been using the answering machine to make it seem as if Fry has been with them but has been so busy, people barley seen him. Bender is trying to drink away his guilt of leaving Fry behind on the balcony that night and he then breaks the bottle only for him to zoom in and see the SOS message Fry wrote.Bender then steals the Planet Express Ship and flys to Omicron Persei 8 to rescue Fry. Meanwhile, Fry and Jrrr go back to the palace to play more games but Lrrr comes into the room and finds Fry hiding in Jrrr's closet. He brings Fry outside in a cage and decides to force Jrrr to shoot Fry. Lrrr notices that Fry looks as if he is ill and orders Jrrr to kill him. However, Jrrr shoots the cage instead, allowing Fry to escape.   Jrrr takes Fry to a nearby doctor with Lrrr and his soldiers chasing after them but they lose them. At the doctors, Fry becomes increasingly ill, [[Drrr]] the doctor explained Fry is being poisoned from eating the excrement Jrrr drops and instead of saving him with the antidote, decides to put Fry down. Lrrr comes in and shoots Drrr's arm off.  He then orders Jrrr to kill Fry but Jrrr angrily refuses, saying that he will never be like his father. Lrrr is surprised at this and says that he is proud of Jrrr because he proved his manhood by standing up to his own father and says that he will kill Fry for Jrrr. However, Drrr announces that Fry is dead, which causes Jrrr to become very upset and start crying. Jrrr and Lrrr reconcile and finally bond. Fry is discovered to be alive but with a glowing light in his butt because he ate some of the herbs which turn out to be bioluminescent.   Bender arrives with the ship and enters the room to get Fry. Fry wakes up decides to leave with Bender. However, Jrrr wishes for Fry to stay so they could always hang out and grow up together, but Fry explains he needs to grow up on his own. Jrrr's butt soon starts glowing as well and becomes overjoyed by the light symbolizing his friendship with Fry. Fry then goes back to Planet Express where no one knew that he was gone because of Bender's constant use of the answering machine. Leela comes up to Fry talking about their makeout session in a dark closet and how he was ""like a machine"" Bender then uses the answering machine to make it say ""I love you. It's me Fry."" Leela than kisses Fry and Fry's butt begins to glow.   "
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0," == Summary == :""''[[Captain's log, USS Enterprise (NCC-1701), 2270|Captain's log]], [[stardate|stardate 6063.4]]. The {{Enterprise}} is tracing the origin of a mysterious [[Kukulkan's probe|alien space probe]]. It approached the [[Federation]] [[homeworld|home worlds]], made a scan of [[Earth]]'s [[Sol|system]] and then signaled outward into space. Before it could be intercepted, the probe self-destructed. We are following a trail of disrupted matter left by the probe's highly advanced propulsion system. Thus far the trail has not intercepted any inhabited star systems.''""  Soon, the ''Enterprise'' encounters an alien vessel that is approaching on the same course as the probe. It is twice the size of the ''Enterprise'', surrounded by an immense [[energy field]] and composed of [[crystalline ceramic]]. A globular [[force field]] encompasses the Federation vessel. The [[Kukulkan's ship|alien ship]] probes the ''Enterprise'', then the surrounding energy pattern shifts and transforms itself into the shape of a large feathered serpent, which [[Ensign]] [[Walking Bear]], an ''Enterprise'' [[helmsman]], recognizes as [[Kukulkan]].  Upset over being forgotten by Earthlings, Kukulkan gives the crew one chance to redeem themselves because one crewman did not forget him. Kukulkan states that if they fail him again, all of their kind shall perish. When asked, Walking Bear tells [[Captain]] [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]] that he is a [[Comanche]] and has studied his background. The ship bears a strong resemblance to a [[god]] of ancient [[Mayan]] and [[Aztec]] legends. The Mayans had a legend of a [[Quetzalcoatl|winged serpent god]] who came from the skies. They could conceivably be dealing with a space traveler who visited Earth in early times and was the basis for such legends. As Kirk ponders why Kukulkan would want to destroy them, McCoy disappears from [[sickbay]] and [[Montgomery Scott|Scott]] vanishes from [[engineering]]. On the bridge, as Kirk asks Walking Bear more about the ancient legends of Kukulkan, the helmsman too disappears. After that, Kirk vanishes as well, leaving Spock in command of the ''Enterprise''.  :""''Captain's log, stardate 6063.5. [[First officer]] [[Spock]] in temporary command. The ''Enterprise'' is a captive of an alien [[lifeform]] calling itself Kukulkan. Captain Kirk and three other officers have vanished. They were most likely transported by Kukulkan to his ship.''""  Inside the other ship, Kirk asks Walking Bear if legend says what happened to Kukulkan. The ensign tells him no, only that he left and promised to return one day. Kirk surmises that the space probe was his. Kukulkan says, ""''Now I have shown you the seeds I have sown before. Learn from them. Find their purpose if you can. Only then will I appear before you.''"" If they fail, the crew of the ''Enterprise'' will all perish.  The four crew members are transported to an [[Kukulkan's city|Earth-like city]] filled with many cultures that appears to be one gigantic riddle, as Kirk points out. Walking Bear tells Kirk that Kukulkan gave the Mayans [[Mayan calendar|a remarkably accurate calendar]] and instructed them to build a city according to its cycles. When the city was finished, Kukulkan was supposed to return. The Mayans built their city and waited. Kukulkan never appeared. Kirk reasons that he must have visited several ancient people on Earth but each one only used part of his knowledge to build their cultures. If no one built this city exactly right, that is why Kukulkan never came back. The city is the key. It must contain some sort of signaling device.  Kirk decides that it must be the {{dis|pyramid|structure}} in the center of the city that may be the key to figuring out the riddle. He climbs it and gets McCoy, Scott, and Walking Bear to turn the heads of the {{serpent}} statues to all strike a certain space on the pyramid. When they accomplish the task, Kukulkan appears as the winged serpent, alleging to be their master. He claims they strayed from the path he set. Kirk claims he doesn't know him so Kukulkan will teach him. Transported to an ominous ""life-room,"" the crew members notice a variety of creatures from around the galaxy, all in small cages. There is even a ferocious, but now peaceful, [[Capellan power-cat]].   Kukulkan says they are contented. Each creature's mind thinks that it is on its own world, created by [[Unnamed tools and technology#Kukulkan's machinery|Kukulkan's machinery]]. They are his only companions, his children to be shown how to live. Kirk says, ""''If children are made totally dependent on their teachers, they will never be anything but children.''"" Kukulkan has had enough. Despite what he has shown them, they still cling to their disobedient ways. Kirk explains that they cannot accept Kukulkan as their master, despite his contributions to mankind.  On the ''Enterprise'', [[Spock]] discovers a way to break the energy field surrounding the ship, distracting Kukulkan from the other crewmen. Kirk and McCoy remove a large tube connected to the Capellan power-cat's cage which keeps its mind at rest. The cat awakens and this causes it to break out of its cage with its naturally produced [[electricity]]. The power-cat barges around the room and causes the other animals to be released from their cages, thereby creating a chaos which Kukulkan is unable to control. The power-cat traps Kukulkan, which forces him to reveal himself as a mortal. Kirk saves Kukulkan and thus teaches him a valuable lesson about Human survival. Kukulkan leaves as an old, broken mortal, and Kirk decides that the price of infinite knowledge is too high to pay. McCoy reminds them of a line from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'', ""''How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child.''"" "
0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"== Summary == === Teaser === [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Jadzia Dax|Dax]] and [[Captain]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] are looking out of one of the [[Promenade]] [[viewport]]s at the [[Bajoran wormhole|wormhole]] as it opens and then promptly closes, without any ships emerging. Dax explains that this is the seventh time this has happened within the last two hours and that each time there are no unusual [[sensor]] readings or any sign of ships leaving the wormhole. She mentions that the [[Bajoran]]s are seeing the unusual phenomenon as a sign from the [[Prophet]]s, and Sisko, only half-jokingly, asks why the Prophets would send a sign without telling him. Dax rejoins that perhaps they are having trouble recognizing their [[Emissary of the Prophets|Emissary]] with his new [[beard]]. The two walk on and as they reach the railing, they notice [[Odo]] emerging from an [[airlock]] on the lower deck looking slightly aggravated, but before Sisko can find out why Dax finds this so funny, their conversation is interrupted by a comm message from [[Worf]]: a [[priority one]] message from [[Starfleet Security]] has just arrived.   of [[Stardate]] 49170.65]] In the meantime, Odo makes his way to [[Quark's Bar, Grill, Gaming House and Holosuite Arcade|Quark's Bar]] and after asking if Dax is there, accuses him of probably being in cahoots with her in shifting all the [[furniture]] in his [[quarters]] while he was regenerating. [[Quark]] doesn't see what the big deal is; Odo explains that all his belongings are ""carefully and painstakingly arranged"" and that Dax, while knowing this, has broken in for the fourth time in the past year to move everything out of alignment. Amused, Quark asks Odo to say hello to Dax for him when Odo is called away to [[Operations center|Ops]] too.  As Odo arrives at Ops, the other members of the [[senior staff]] are already discussing the message. Worf explains that the message contains a recording made at a [[Antwerp Conference|Conference]] between diplomatic representatives from the [[Federation]] and the [[Romulan Star Empire]] on [[Earth]]. The video is played and shows an explosion caused by a [[bomb]] of unknown origin. Worf commands the computer to play the video again but to enlarge a certain section and slow playback to one-tenth of normal speed. This time, a [[vase]] can be seen to shimmer in the same way that [[Changeling]]s do in their liquid form. The remains of a Changeling were not found in the wreckage, however, which probably means it escaped without injury. Sisko can not believe it has come to this, but it would seem that the Changelings have finally reached Earth.  === Act One === Odo and Dax are in Odo's quarters, with her ""repairing the damage"" that she had caused. They discuss the trip to Earth which Sisko and Odo will be making aboard the {{USS|Lakota}}. Odo doesn't seem to think he will be able to tell [[Starfleet]] any more about his race than he already has done in his previous official reports, but Dax says that if there really are Changelings on Earth, then Starfleet is going to need as much help as it can get.  Sisko is in his [[quarters]] talking with his father, [[Joseph Sisko]] on his [[desktop monitor]]. They are discussing [[Sisko's Creole Kitchen|Sisko's]] &ndash; the family [[restaurant]] in [[New Orleans]]. Joseph doesn't seem to understand that Ben isn't on a pleasure trip and Ben has to explain that he will probably be spending most of his time in [[Starfleet Headquarters]]. After a short discussion, [[Jake Sisko|Jake]] comes into the room. Jake asks if his father has told Joseph that they won't be staying with him. Ben admits he hasn't told him just yet, and Jake complains that if they have to stay with his grandfather, he will have to work in the kitchen all day peeling [[potato]]es. Ben tells Jake he is old enough now not to worry about having to peel potatoes all day &ndash; his grandfather will probably want him to serve the guests instead, much to Jake's dismay.  Back in Quark's, [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien]] and [[Doctor]] [[Julian Bashir]] leave the [[holosuite]] entering the bar dressed in [[World War II]]-style flying jackets and caps. Bashir orders scotch and O'Brien orders a pint of beer; they seem to be discussing the [[Battle of Britain]]. Quark asks why they are in the bar when the [[German]]s are attacking, but Bashir explains they have to be &ndash; it is part of a ritual to remember fallen comrades. ""''To [[Clive]]''"" shouts O'Brien, after which they both down their drinks in one gulp and are about to smash their empty glasses on the bar, when Quark reminds them that they have already discussed the smashing of empty glasses. At any rate, Quark thinks they are taking it all a bit too seriously. After all, Clive was only a holosuite figure. O'Brien tries to explain to Quark that there's more to it than just Clive &ndash; it is about the Earth. O'Brien says that when a place you love is in danger and you try to take some action to help make that place safer but fail, it can be very frustrating. Quark says he knows exactly what O'Brien means and tells his own story about how he was serving as a cook aboard a [[Quark's freighter 001|Ferengi freighter]] hundreds of [[light year]]s away from home as a terrible [[Great Monetary Collapse|currency crisis]] hit [[Ferenginar]]. He says he couldn't begin to explain how bad he felt to know that runaway [[inflation]] and rapid currency devaluation was rampaging across his planet like a brush fire. He still hasn't gotten over it to this day when he thinks about how he was powerless to save his accounts.  O'Brien quips that, despite Quark's little story, he doesn't feel any better. Odo walks past the bar and Bashir and O'Brien leave and join him. They briefly discuss the Battle of Britain &ndash; Bashir offers Odo the place of Clive, but Odo isn't so sure he wants it &ndash; for obvious reasons. O'Brien asks Odo to visit his family in [[Dublin]] and make sure they are all fine. Clearly recent events have set him and many other people slightly on edge. Odo offers to look up anyone for Bashir, but the doctor replies that he doesn't have anyone there for him. Bashir says he wishes he could be going along for the ride too and Odo agrees he could do with the company as he has doubts that a [[Changeling]] would be very welcome on Earth. O'Brien tries to comfort Odo by reassuring him that people can't hold him responsible for the acts of his people. Odo remains unconvinced however and departs for the ''Lakota''.  ]] Back in Ops, O'Brien reports that the ''Lakota'' has departed the station and has entered [[warp drive|warp]]. Worf and [[Major]] [[Kira Nerys]] discuss the wormhole which has now returned to ""normal"" having last opened twelve hours previously. Kira is somewhat disappointed, as she had hoped that it was the work of the Prophets and that they had finally decided to show themselves to the [[Bajoran]] people. Worf comments that he prefers the [[Klingon]] belief system. Kira asks if the Klingon [[Gods]] are just as mysterious and cryptic as those of the Bajorans &ndash; of course, the Klingons don't have any Gods. They were executed by Klingon warriors over 1,000 years ago because they ""brought more trouble than it was worth"". O'Brien and Kira agree that nobody can understand the Klingons but, as O'Brien says, that's the way they like it.   Later, on Earth at [[Starfleet Headquarters]] in [[San Francisco]], Sisko and Odo meet [[Vice Admiral|Admiral]] [[Leyton]] and [[Commander]] [[Benteen]] in front of the building. After a short series of introductions, Sisko reveals that it was Admiral Leyton, his former [[commanding officer]] on the {{USS|Okinawa}}, who recommended him for the post on [[Deep Space 9]], the theme of the conversation changes to Odo and Changelings. The admiral hopes that with the help of Sisko and Odo, the task of finding the Changelings on Earth will be easier. Sisko doubts that he and Odo were brought all the way to Earth merely to discuss the situation. Leyton confirms this: because of Sisko's detailed knowledge of and experiences with the [[Founder]]s, Leyton names him as the acting [[Chief of Starfleet Security]] on Earth, effective immediately.  === Act Two === ]] At Sisko's, Joseph Sisko is serving the customers as one can only assume he usually does, cheerily walking around the restaurant talking aloud to all his customers. He suggests that nobody should even need to look at the dessert menu because if they miss out on his [[bread pudding soufflé]], they will regret it. His son Benjamin Sisko enters and agrees with his dad telling the customers that his father ""knows his bread pudding soufflé"". Jake also appears and a short discussion about Jake growing up and the history of the [[alligator]] hanging in the restaurant follows. Eventually, the three sit at a table and discuss the current situation. Odo is not present, having decided, according to Ben, it was wiser to stay in [[Starfleet Headquarters]] under the circumstances. Joseph can understand why, after all, he hasn't seen people so nervous since the last [[Borg]] [[The Best of Both Worlds, Part II|incident]]. Anyway, he finds anyone who doesn't eat inherently suspect. Joseph recognizes however that Starfleet must be taking the whole situation very seriously, especially to bring Ben all the way from Deep Space 9 to deal with it. As the three talk, Ben notes his father has lost weight and becomes concerned. Joseph sternly tells his son and grandson that he feels fine. Shortly thereafter, [[Cadet]] [[Nog]] enters the restaurant. It turns out he eats at Sisko's regularly because it is one of the only places on Earth where he can get his [[tube grub]]s live. Joseph would of course add them to his menu, but his Human customers would expect them cooked and with a sauce. Nog finds the idea somewhat confusing as the grubs should be alive and moving as they go down. The idea completely puts Ben off his food.  Some time later, as the restaurant is closing, Nog and Jake sit down at a table where Nog explains that he is having problems at the [[Starfleet Academy|Academy]] which he at first put down to him being a [[Ferengi]]. He later realized that wasn't the reason and many students have the same problem, especially where [[Red Squad]] is concerned. Red Squad members receive special treatment like extra lessons and excursions that the other students don't. Jake assures Nog that as soon as his fellow cadets get to know him, everything will begin to work out.   Admiral Leyton and Ben Sisko meet with [[Jaresh-Inyo]], the [[President of the United Federation of Planets|President of the Federation]] in [[Paris]] &ndash; the [[Eiffel Tower]] is clearly visible through the window. Sisko has a number of recommendations for the President regarding the [[Dominion]] infiltration and how it can be combated. The President is not eager to turn Earth into a military outpost where everybody must submit to blood tests and [[phaser]] examinations of every room must be carried out. He quickly changes his mind however when it turns out that the attaché case Sisko was carrying is, in fact, Odo. Odo points out that Sisko and Leyton were allowed to see the President without having to undergo a blood test or having their personal property checked. If he had been a [[Founder]], he could have killed the President or simply taken his place. The President begrudgingly agrees to allow the new security procedures saying that it has taken a lot of hard work to change Earth into the peaceful world that it now is and that he doesn't wish for this paradise to be destroyed. ""''We're not looking to destroy paradise,''"" says Sisko, ""''we're looking to save it.''""  === Act Three ===  device]] Sisko and Benteen are going over the new security arrangements using Odo as a test subject. As Sisko [[The Adversary (episode)|found out previously]], Changelings can easily be located by sweeping an area with a low energy level phaser beam. A small device mounted above the door of a room can be used to send out a wide phaser beam and scan the room systematically. When the beam comes into contact with a hidden Changeling they are injured and forced to return to their normal form. A beam strength of 3.4 should be enough to stun any Changelings according to Benteen but Odo recommends a strength of 3.5 just to be on the safe side. Following the success of the test run, Sisko orders the devices to be installed in every room in [[Starfleet Headquarters]] as well as the orbital facilities. As Benteen leaves, she thanks Sisko for managing to convince the President that such measures were necessary. ""''You think she would have thanked me as well,''"" says Odo after she leaves. ""''I'm the one that got shot thirteen times today.''"". As Nog enters the room, he asks to speak to Sisko alone, and Odo departs. Sisko and Nog discuss the problems he has been having at the [[Starfleet Academy|Academy]]. Sisko says they both knew it would take time for Nog to get used to the academy &ndash; and vice versa. Nog wants to become a member of [[Red Squad]] and asks Sisko for his help. A Red Squad didn't exist when Sisko was at the Academy and Nog admits it is very new, but says he has the grades he needs to join the squad, he just needs the recommendation of a high-ranking officer. Sisko says, when he gets the chance, he will see what he can do. He then, somewhat abruptly, dismisses Nog from the room.  Back at Sisko's, the restaurant seems to be closed and Joseph is preparing things for when it opens later in the day. Ben tells his father that he has been very busy, but that he can't talk about it. His father replies, ""''Think the admiral could spare you for a few hours a day to visit your father?''"". Joseph seems to be somewhat disappointed as Jake is away at the [[Pennington School|Pennington writing school]] in [[New Zealand]] and Ben is constantly busy at Starfleet Headquarters &ndash; it is almost as if they were not there at all. Ben counters that his father is more than welcome to visit him and his son on Deep Space 9, but Joseph seems to be very attached to his restaurant and couldn't possibly leave. They discuss Joseph's declining health but the topic changes to business again. Ben says he has a free hour and they agree to go for a walk together in [[Audubon Park]].   uncovers the [[Changeling]] impostor]] Back at Starfleet Headquarters at San Francisco, a [[seagull]] flies from the sky and lands on a rock before transforming into Odo. Benteen and Admiral Leyton approach just in time to see him finish the transformation. He explains he has just flown around San Francisco and is very impressed, noting that the [[architecture]] is not as ancient as that on [[Bajor]] but is still impressive. Benteen wonders how many other Changelings are up there in the skies, but Odo says if that was all the Changelings were interested in doing, people wouldn't have to be so worried. Leyton however, rather rudely comments that the other Changelings have better things to do than imitate birds &ndash; after all, the other Changelings are much better than Odo at imitating Humans. Benteen, trying to ease the tension a little, says she found the seagull very convincing, but Odo isn't so sure the other seagulls were convinced. Leyton suggests that Odo keep practicing until he succeeds in making the birds think he is one of them. Again, his tone is somewhat abrupt. Odo has picked up on all these signals, however, and he offers the admiral a compliment and holds his hand out in a ""shake hands"" gesture. The Admiral ignores this and walks away, but Odo catches hold of his arm and their hands fuse together as Changelings do when they link &ndash; Leyton is not who he appears to be. The Leyton impostor replies to this sarcastically with ""''Well done, Odo''"" then pulls his arm free, transforms into a bird and flies away.   Some time later, Odo, the real Admiral Leyton, Sisko and Benteen are together in a room discussing the impostor. Odo says he knew that it wasn't the real Leyton because he felt the impostor was treating him somewhat aggressively. As Sisko says, Odo is the first Changeling to have harmed another and it is therefore understandable that they have such feelings about him. Leyton can't understand why the Changeling would have taken on his form but, as Benteen explains, Leyton is a prime target &ndash; he has access to all the security protocols. The important thing is however, that the new security measures don't go far enough to stop Changelings from breaking into Starfleet Headquarters. Leyton knows, however, that the President won't allow tighter security. He has been a good peacetime president, but the situation could break out into war if drastic action isn't taken. ""''The president is a long way from home,''"" says Leyton and that they couldn't expect him to be as concerned about the state of affairs on Earth as a Human would be. The conversation is interrupted by an incoming comm message for Sisko. It's Jake asking Ben to come back to the restaurant as soon as he can&hellip; Joseph has been arrested.  === Act Four ===  As Ben arrives at Sisko's, he finds two Starfleet officers and his father arguing. The officers have tried to carry out blood tests on Jake and Joseph. They attempt to explain to Joseph that they are simply following the orders given to them that all family members of Starfleet personnel must have their blood checked regularly. No exceptions. Joseph can't believe that such orders would ever have been given and he finds it even harder to believe that his own son was the one who passed them. Even after Ben and Jake submit to the test, Joseph refuses, calling the officers [[vampire]]s. Joseph and Ben argue, initially about the procedures but leads into Ben bringing up his father's poor health: Joseph has not visited his doctor in eight months. As the two's conversation becomes more heated, Ben pleads with his father to get help from his family as well as his doctor; Joseph argues that maintaining his health will take too much time away from his restaurant and he's too old to manage both. During the two's progressively heated conversation, Joseph cuts his hand. He rushes over to the sink to wash the wound. Ben, without even thinking, examines the blood on the knife. Joseph is shocked, clearly disappointed and angry, but this is exactly what the Changelings wanted to happen. People are so scared that they are beginning to have doubts about their own family members. The blood tests may not be all that infallible anyway. Joseph argues that if the Changelings are all that clever, they'll find a way around the blood screening tests telling Ben there's not a test that exists that someone smart enough can't get around. Suddenly, Joseph suffers a mild [[stroke]], caused both by his atherosclerosis and because he got so enraged and overexerted himself.   Back in San Francisco, Odo and Sisko discuss Joseph's recent ill health and Odo points out that when Humans are supposed to do something that would be good for them, they often do the exact opposite. However, the thing which worries Sisko most is that he actually believed that his father was a Changeling, which Odo claims to be a wise thing to assume. Of course, this is exactly what the Founders wish to happen. Sisko tells Odo, ""''There are times, I wish you'd never found your people''"", and hopes the Constable understands. Odo tells Sisko that he not only understands, but he sometimes feels exactly the same way.  Back at Sisko's, Joseph is back on his feet and going about his work as if nothing had happened &ndash; talking with his customers while serving them their food. Eventually, Joseph sits down for a moment and talks with Jake about Ben. He is worried that he is overworked and stressed. Before Jake can reply, the lights go out in the restaurant. Nobody is quite sure what has happened, but Jake looks out a window and says that the whole block is without power.  Sisko, trapped in an office by the power outage, is trying to open the door as Odo and Admiral Leyton pry it open from the other side. Leyton explains that it looks like the whole [[global power grid]] on Earth has been knocked out including the emergency backups at Starfleet Headquarters. All the evidence points to [[sabotage]] and the prime candidates are clearly the Changelings. The power outage means that transporters, sensors and every defense installation on the surface is inactive &ndash; which means that the Earth is totally defenseless against a Dominion attack.  === Act Five ===  hands over control]] ""''I'm not interested in excuses,''"" says the president as he demands that the power relay system be restored as soon as possible. As he finishes his speech, Sisko, Odo, Leyton and two other officers beam into the office via the [[transporter]]s on the ''Lakota''. Sisko, in his post as chief of Starfleet Security, recommends that the president call a state of emergency. With the exception of the Borg incident, it has been over a hundred years since such a state was last called. Sisko explains that he has reason to believe that a [[Dominion]] fleet is somewhere in the [[Alpha Quadrant]] ready to launch an attack on the now defenseless Earth. Sisko continues to explain that, shortly before he and Odo left Deep Space 9, the [[wormhole]] was repeatedly opening and closing although no ships were detected traveling through it. It is more than possible, Odo continues, that the Founders salvaged [[cloaking device]]s from the [[Romulan]]-[[Cardassian]] fleet that was destroyed at the [[Battle of the Omarion Nebula]]. As it is going to take a fair amount of time to get the power relay system back online (it could take days), the only way to defend Earth is by using the transporters and communication systems of the ''Lakota'' to mobilize Starfleet officers. The President is still hesitant to agree to the suggestions, but after Sisko explains how brutal the [[Jem'Hadar]] can be in close combat and how they won't differentiate between soldiers and civilians, the president gives control of Earth's defenses over to Sisko and Leyton.  At Sisko's, Jake looks out of the window with his grandfather to see armed [[Federation]] troops beaming down into the streets, leaving both startled that the situation has escalated so seriously.

==Plot==
Rapper Marvin Gardens is rich and famous, and jogging down the street of his expensive residential district. After a police car passes him, its siren running, Marvin returns home to his beautiful wife, Jasmine. After she leaves, Marvin conducts a phone interview with a reporter, who notes that Marvin is number three on the charts. After the interview is over, Marvin plays video games with his young son Marvin Jr., then goes to exercise. As he exercises, Marvin suddenly finds himself in a dark room as a police officer interrogates him about killing another cop. Marvin tells the policeman that he is innocent but the man does not believe him and starts choking him. Marvin then finds himself back in the exercise room, gasping for breath.

When Jasmine finds out, she is concerned about Marvin but he insists it is just stress from trying to get his new album out on deadline. She tells him that she will love him no matter what and kisses him. After recording a session in the studio, Marvin drives home but is pulled over by a black police officer who asks to see his license. As Marvin does so, he finds himself back in the room being beaten by police, including the one who pulled him over. They demand to know what he did with the gun and call him ""Dwayne"". Marvin has no idea what is going on and denies shooting anyone and then he finds himself back in his car. The officer who pulled him over apologizes and asks for his autograph.

Marvin makes an appointment with Dr. Sinclair, a psychologist, and explains his experiences. He also talks about how he grew up in the ghetto but has worked his way off the streets and has never heard about anyone called ""Dwayne"". Sinclair wonders if Marvin is suppressing a memory and Marvin insists he is never going back to the streets.

Marvin returns home to find Marvin Jr. playing with a toy gun. Marvin angrily takes his son's toy gun (because of the violence Marvin had seen on the streets as a young man, Marvin has a deep loathing for firearms, be they toy or real). Later in bed, Jasmine talks about how she is glad that Marvin went to see Sinclair, and they make love. However, Marvin finds himself back in the dark room, where Sinclair is in charge of the interrogation. A female detective offers Marvin water and tries to help him: it is Jasmine. She only knows him as Dwayne but Marvin does not know what she is talking about. He finds himself back in bed with Jasmine. Angry, he snaps at her then apologizes and promises that when he is done with his album, he will be fine.

Marvin goes to the studio to finish his album but collapses when he finds himself back in the dark room again. He goes back to Sinclair and then finds himself back in the room with Sinclair demanding that he confess. The police beat Marvin again despite his protestations of innocence, and then he is back with Sinclair again. He insists that he does not need any help and he created the life he believes he deserves. He goes back home and tells Marvin Jr. and Jasmine that they are going to move to a larger place and that they are going to have everything he has ever wanted for them, and that the visions are over.

As Marvin exercises, he finds himself back in the dark room — unconscious. The female detective, Jasmine examines ""Dwayne"" and says there is nothing they can do: his mind has broken and he shows no physical signs of life. Sinclair is not particularly upset, until an officer comes in and informs them that the real shooter has been arrested. Jasmine goes over to Dwayne's body and finds a piece of paper with his lyrics: Marvin's lyrics, talking about his dreams of becoming a famous rapper.

==Short Summary==
Prime Minister Michael Callow faces a shocking dilemma when Princess Susannah, a much-loved member of the Royal Family, is kidnapped.

==Full Summary==
Prime Minister [[Michael Callow]] ([[Rory Kinnear]]) is woken up one morning to be told that [[Princess Susannah]], Duchess of Beaumont ([[Lydia Wilson]]), a much-loved member of the Royal Family, has been kidnapped. A video of Susannah is shown to the Prime Minister where she states that she will be killed if Callow does not follow through with the ransom demand. The demand itself is a shocking one; he must have live sexual intercourse with a pig broadcast on national television at 4pm that afternoon on every network, with a list of technical specifications designed to make it impossible to fake. The kidnappers leaves no details nor any channel for communication, making negotiation impossible. Callow adamantly opposes fulfilling the demand, and orders everything possible to catch the kidnapper before the deadline. Callow also demands the news not reach the public, at which point he is told the final crucial detail; the ransom video came from YouTube and, despite having only been up for nine minutes, has already been viewed, downloaded and copied by many thousand members of the British public. Although the UK's media initially agrees via a D-Notice not to report the story, it soon reaches foreign news networks, which immediately report. After this, the UK media follow suit, and although they sanitise certain details everyone already knows the bizarre ransom demand. The public's response is initially one of sympathy towards Callow, and the majority do not expect him to go through with the demand. However at the same time Twitter wags jokingly discuss the story, mocking Callow and his wife [[Jane Callow|Jane]] (Anna Wilson-Jones).

When the British government first receives the video, the Home Secretary, [[Alex Cairns]] ([[Lindsay Duncan]]) secretly attempts to manufacture fake footage to broadcast (via using highly sophisticated technology to superimpose the PM's head onto porn star Rod Senseless, who would perform in his stead). The kidnapper discovers the ploy (due to someone recognising Senseless and posting a picture on Twitter), and sends Princess Susannah's finger to a UK news station as a response. The story is outed, and public opinion turns sharply against Callow; a majority now demand he follows through with the kidnapper's ransom. Jane tearfully begs him not to go through with it. This drives Callow to order an immediate rescue operation on the building where they believe Susannah is being held, forgoing the recommended observation period. The building is revealed to be a decoy and a reporter is injured during the operation. Callow loses even more support.

With the time near 4:00pm and with no leads or indication as to where Susannah is, preparations for the broadcast are made. Callow tries to refuse to go through with it regardless of what happens to Susannah, only to be told by his staff that he has no choice as his party, the public, and the royal family are ordering him to fulfil the ransom demand. Alex subtly threatens Callow making it clear that if he refuses, neither he nor his family will have protection from repercussions. Callow is forced to capitulate, despite his desperation not to. Many crowds gather to watch the event in workplaces and pubs, as an announcement is made on TV stating what is about to happen, and a noise designed to induce nausea is played in a futile attempt to discourage viewing. Callow is given potency drugs and advice before entering the room. He sees the pig and asks for forgiveness for what he is about to do. Callow has sex with the pig in front of a live global audience, who, despite their empathy and disgust, compel themselves to 'witness history'. The events lasts over an hour, and Callow suffers horribly as he attempts to force himself to climax. The Princess is discovered unharmed in the streets, the finger having belonged to the kidnapper. It is revealed that she was released before the deadline, unnoticed, as everyone was distracted by the broadcast. It emerges that Turner Prize winner [[Carlton Bloom]] planned the events, intending to make an artistic point by showing events of significance slipped under the noses of the public and the government as they were ""elsewhere, watching screens"" and not paying attention to the real world. Bloom commits suicide as the broadcast airs, and it is decided that the early release will not be revealed to anyone, including Callow. Cairns tells Callow, who is vomiting after his ordeal, that the princess is safe.

A year after the broadcast, Callow's political image is better than intact, having gained greater public approval due to his willingness to sacrifice his dignity (or the public's forgetfulness). Princess Susannah has recovered from the kidnapping and is expecting a child, while the public at large knows of Bloom's organising of the affair and have for the most part moved on from the incident. While Callow's reputation has been raised in the eyes of the public, it is implied that his relationship with Jane has not survived the ordeal—a year after the incident, although she makes public appearances with him, she is entirely cold to him in private.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"==Summary== ===Teaser===  [[Commander]] {{Trip Tucker}} and [[Ensign]] [[Travis Mayweather]] are piloting a {{dis|shuttlepod|22nd century}} toward [[Starfleet Headquarters]] in [[San Francisco]] to discover why they have lost all [[communications|communication]] with Earth [[Zero Hour (episode)|since the destruction]] of the [[Xindi weapon]]. Their ""[[first contact]]"" comes in the form of an attack from a small formation of [[aircraft]]. Tucker attempts to contact the planes, but they refuse to answer and continue shooting. Mayweather recognizes the aircraft as [[P-51 Mustang]]s, [[Second World War|World War II]]-era aircraft. He explains to Tucker that he has seen the same design of plane before at [[air show]]s. The aircraft seem to be breaking off, so Tucker looks for a landing area on the ground. However, the planes were simply making sure they wouldn't get hit by heavy anti-aircraft [[artillery]] being fired at the shuttlepod. When the shuttlepod's [[starboard]] engine is damaged, Tucker and Mayweather flee back to the [[orbit]]ing {{NX|Enterprise}}.  ===Act One=== Captain Jonathan Archer, having recovered from his wounds in a [[German]] [[field hospital]], is being transported by the [[SS]] as a prisoner-of-war in the back of a [[Ford Model 51]] [[truck]], escorted by a [[BMW R75]] [[motorcycle]] and a [[Wehrmacht]] [[army]] [[Volkswagen Kübelwagen]], driven by an SS [[soldier]].    A [[Nazi]] officer belittles the [[United States of America|American]] war effort, causing Archer to suspect that he is in Earth's past. However, the officer's swagger and manner of discussion lead Archer to suspect that he may be in an [[alternate timeline]]. Suddenly, [[American Resistance]] [[resistance fighter|fighters]] surround and ambush the small prisoner convoy, killing the drivers and several Nazi guards. Archer escapes from the truck, only to be shot in the arm and held at gunpoint by an insurgent &ndash; an American freedom fighter, in the form of a [[1940s]] [[gangster]].  While ''Enterprise'' continues its orbit of Earth, [[communications officer]] [[Hoshi Sato]] is monitoring [[radio]] transmissions from the planet below. When the [[crew]] listens to a speech by [[Winston Churchill]], Sato comments that the broadcast was made only thirty minutes ago. [[Malcolm Reed]] realizes they have [[time travel|traveled back in time]] two centuries. While [[T'Pol]] calmly suggests a check of the [[sensor]]s, Tucker becomes aggravated. He argues that three .50 caliber [[bullet]]s were just removed from the [[hull]] of ''Enterprise''{{'}}s shuttlepod. He has no doubt that the [[starship]] has traveled to the past, as bullets are no longer used on Earth in the [[2150s]]. T'Pol explains that she is not disputing the fact that ''Enterprise'' has traveled in time. She is simply trying to find a way back to [[2154]]. She repeats that a diagnostic on the ship's systems should be completed and instructs Reed to then check for anomalies. Mayweather suggests there may be a ''reason'' why ''Enterprise'' is in the past, a possibility which T'Pol will not rule out.  Secretly, the [[Suliban]] leader [[Silik]] lurks stealthily through the [[corridor]]s of ''Enterprise'', camouflaged and undetected.   On Earth, a [[Na'kuhl]] officer, [[Ghrath]], wearing the uniform of an [[SS]] ''[[Obersturmführer]]'' reports to [[Vosk]], his leader, that the [[German]]s believe there are now more than five thousand resistance fighters. Ghrath attempts to explain Archer's escape by stating that the resistance is becoming better organized and more determined. Vosk is disappointed in the Na'kuhl officer and suggests that Ghrath should have ensured that the [[Starfleet]] captain was securely imprisoned. Vosk indicates that Archer was more than just another American prisoner and explains that he was carrying a [[communicator|communications device]] from the future. Ghrath suspects that Archer is a [[temporal agent]], and promises that the captain will be recaptured soon.  In the [[captain's ready room]], Tucker arrives and apologizes to T'Pol for his earlier outburst. He believes the [[Vulcan]] was too busy for his outrage on the [[bridge]], although T'Pol understands his reaction. Like her, Tucker had expectations of finally returning to Earth after ''Enterprise''{{'}}s perilous [[search for the Xindi weapon]]. T'Pol reveals that she had been looking forward to returning to {{dis|Vulcan|planet}}. When Tucker remembers that captain Archer always looked for positive aspects in a dour situation, T'Pol thinks the captain would have difficulty doing so in ''Enterprise''{{'}}s present circumstances... but would try anyway. Reed enters and reports that the military dispatches picked up have told of battles being fought in [[Virginia]] and [[Ohio]], which shouldn't be the case as the Nazis never made it to North America. The officers slowly grasp that they are in an alternate timeline, one in which events have digressed significantly from recorded history as they knew it.  In [[sickbay]], [[Phlox]] is trying to tempt [[Porthos]] into eating [[chicken]] [[liver]] with grated [[cheese]], the [[dog]]'s favorite meal. When he accepts that Porthos won't eat the [[food]], he wonders if the dog would like to hear a [[Denobulan lullaby]], then decides it is more likely that Porthos would prefer to enjoy a [[steak]] and heads toward sickbay's doors, with the intention of visiting {{dis|Chef|Enterprise NX-01}}. Suddenly, Phlox is surprised when a strange, grotesque figure barges through the doors and falls into the doctor's arms. Although Phlox doesn't realize it, the figure is a severely deformed {{dis|Daniels|Crewman}}, the temporal agent from the [[31st century]].  Meanwhile, Archer wakes up in the apartment of [[Alicia Travers]], who is tending his wounds. Seeing the [[Enterprise (NX-01)|''Enterprise'']] patch on Archer's uniform, she assumes he is a survivor from the [[World War II|WWII]]-era [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|of the same name]], which has sunk in this timeline. Archer looks out of a window and sees Nazi soldiers as they patrol the barricaded, burning streets outside. When Travers informs Archer that he is in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], in [[1944]], the captain is certain that there is something terribly wrong with the [[timeline]].  ===Act Two===  Later, in the US [[White House]], which is draped with [[swastika]]s and guarded by German Jagdtiger tank destroyers, Vosk shows the [[Human 20th century generalmajor|German ''Generalmajor'']] a film of a Na'kuhl [[weapon]], which uses a [[modulating plasma pulse]] to destroy a [[tank]]. The weapon, which Vosk refers to as a [[plasma rifle]], requires a considerable amount of [[energy]]. Vosk implies that the weapon is from the future, where power is much more easily obtainable. The Na'kuhl submits requisition forms of [[Materials and substances|materials]] which he needs. The lists include great quantities of [[aluminum]] and [[carbon steel]]. The German general worries that the American military (as most of the country is still unoccupied) may be planning a counterattack against the Nazis. He notifies Vosk that the Germans have suffered difficulties in [[Africa]] and in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. Vosk replies that the Na'kuhl weapon will ensure the Nazis are safe from any further insurrections and suggests the possibility of creating a water-based [[pathogen]] to wipe out all non-[[Aryan]]s, supplanting the need for Nazi extermination camps. Vosk warns the German general to deliver the supplies which the Na'kuhl need, or their alliance will be dissolved.  Aboard ''Enterprise'', Phlox reports the findings of his analysis of Daniels to T'Pol. Portions of the time traveler's body have aged at extremely differing rates. The doctor cannot tell why, except that it is not an infection. He is surprised that his patient is still alive and doubts that Daniels will survive for longer than a day. T'Pol raises the possibility that Daniels is the reason for ''Enterprise''{{'}}s time displacement and that he may hold the answer to the crew's return to 2154. The Vulcan states that she must speak to the time traveler, who is currently unconscious.  As several gangsters try to hide their identities from a group of nearby Nazi soldiers, they wander past a man whom the Nazis kill. The Germans force several other civilians into a large truck, as the gangsters enter a building.   When Alicia Travers hears a heavy knock on the door of her apartment, she takes a [[gun]] to the door to ensure her safety. She realizes that the visitors are [[Sal]] and [[Carmine]], two of the gangsters who watched the Nazis outside. Sal notifies Travers that their friend, [[Vic]], was arrested a few hours ago and is probably being tortured. The [[Gestapo]] are clearing out entire buildings and shooting people on the street in their search for Archer. Sal demands to know why the Nazis' search is so important and why they are being so ruthless. Archer refuses to divulge his identity, citing the confidentiality of his assignment. Sal assumes that Archer is a member of the American military, an organization which didn't defend their own country. Sal worries that Vic might succumb to the Nazis' interrogation and fears for Travers' life, if she stays in her apartment. However, Travers refuses to leave her home. The gangsters exit, attempting to find more information about Vic.   As T'Pol enters sickbay, Phlox tells her that Daniels has regained consciousness. When the time traveler asks where Archer is, T'Pol tells him that he died destroying the Xindi weapon (as the ''Enterprise'' crew are still unaware that he was not aboard when it exploded). Daniels informs them that the [[Temporal Cold War]] is no longer a ""cold"" war &ndash; it has become an all-out conflict, with temporal agents trying to alter history to their own side's advantage, leading to paradoxes and turbulence in the [[time stream]]. Daniels admits that ''Enterprise'' can't return to its own time, as it didn't exist in the same way that the crew knew it before they left. Before passing out, the time traveler insists that the crew ""Stop ''him''"", but T'Pol doesn't know to whom Daniels is referring.  On Earth, Ghrath informs Vosk that the Nazis are searching for Archer within a fifteen-mile radius of the area where he escaped. They haven't found the captain yet, although they did arrest several resistance fighters, who are now being interrogated. Ghrath suspects a particular member of the resistance of assisting with the ambush that resulted in Archer's freedom. Vosk tells the Na'kuhl officer that the Nazis have detected ''Enterprise'' and orders Ghrath to bring the suspected resistance fighter before the Na'kuhl leader.  Meanwhile, Archer has changed from his Starfleet [[uniform]] into typical attire for the time period, which are Travers' husband's clothes. He and Travers sit down to eat a meal. Travers informs Archer that her husband, whom they were talking about previously, is aboard a [[destroyer]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] (where the war against the [[Japanese]] is going just as badly). Travers stands up again, stating that the Nazis take all the good food. She recalls seeing a German tank when the Nazis first arrived in New York. She also recalls hearing a speech on the [[radio]] by the [[President of the United States|President]], vowing to persevere, shortly before the American [[government]] evacuated [[Washington, DC|Washington]]. Archer recognizes [[music]] in the background as a recording by [[Billie Holiday]] of ""[[My Old Flame]]"".   Outside Travers' apartment, she tells Archer that the Nazis outlawed ""colored music"", which includes songs by Billie Holiday. However, some of Travers' neighbors pass around a [[phonograph]] between the houses every night, so that the Germans won't find it. When Archer asks Travers about the alien Nazi, a creature with gray skin and red eyes, he learns that Travers has heard similar stories about the alien from Sal. Archer thinks that these stories may actually be factual and asks Travers if she could contact Sal.   In ''Enterprise''{{'}}s [[launch bay]], Tucker discovers that the damaged shuttlepod's [[EPS conduit]] is ""fried"" and asks an [[engineering officer]], [[Walsh]], to retrieve a replacement EPS conduit from the [[injector assembly]] in [[engineering]]. As Tucker lies alone, attempting to repair the shuttlepod, a shadow crosses over his body. Alarmed, the engineer stands up and scans the launch bay. With a [[disruptor]] aimed at Tucker, Silik alerts the engineer to the presence of the Suliban leader. Although Silik explains that he didn't bring ''Enterprise'' back in time, he claims that the reason for the starship's travel through time is beyond Tucker's understanding. When he orders Tucker to get into the shuttlepod, the engineer is reluctant to do so. Eventually, Tucker acts as if he is about to climb aboard, then slams the shuttlepod's door onto Silik's hand. The two wrestle, with Tucker eventually attaining a hold around the Suliban's neck. However, Silik shape-shifts out of Tucker's grasp and stuns the engineer with the Suliban disruptor.  On the bridge, Mayweather notices that a shuttlepod is being launched from the depressurized [[launch bay]]. When T'Pol orders Hoshi Sato to [[hail]] the craft, Reed detects a Suliban [[life sign]] aboard &ndash; the only occupant of the shuttlepod. T'Pol, who is extremely alarmed at this news, orders Reed to fire ''Enterprise''{{'}}s [[phase cannon]]s.  In space, the shuttlepod avoids any serious damage from the starship's phase cannons and slowly descends into Earth's upper [[atmosphere]].  ===Act Three===  On a stairway leading down from the street to the closed [[Sixth Avenue]] [[subway]] line, Archer, Travers, and [[Carmine]] secretly meet to discuss the alien Nazi. Carmine agrees to let Sal know that Archer wants to talk with him. Carmine then offers Travers a [[hamburger]], explaining that the Nazis are cutting the meat [[ration]] again, increasing the rarity &ndash; and thus also the value &ndash; of meat. Carmine tells Travers to be careful and walks away. As Archer and Travers leave after him, they pass a store called [[T. Purser Hardware and Plumbing]]. Travers explains to Archer that the Nazis have slowly decreased the amount of meat that they give to the American citizens. The Germans blame the members of the resistance for disrupting the food shipment, which makes the Nazis look like heroes, fighting to feed the American public. When Archer and Travers notice that two Nazis have spotted them, Travers tells Archer not to make eye contact. She quickly discards the hamburger as they approach. When the Germans taunt Archer and Travers with [[racism|racist]] remarks, the Starfleet captain responds with more assertiveness than Travers does. Eventually, the two Germans leave them alone, Travers remarking that the neighborhood has worsened with the Nazi occupation.  On the bridge of ''Enterprise'' in the [[situation room]], T'Pol remembers Daniels' words &ndash; ""stop him"". Tucker believes that the temporal agent was referring to Silik, who has escaped by disabling a [[transponder]]. However, ''Enterprise'' is detecting trace [[plasma]] signatures, probably from the minor damage that the starship's phase cannons caused. Reed believes he will be able to beam an [[away team]] to within three [[kilometer]]s of where the shuttlepod landed. Tucker can't understand why Silik saved the engineer, when the Suliban could have depressurized the launch bay without removing Tucker from the room.  Archer, Travers, Carmine, and Sal hide as an American [[automobile]] rushes through a nearby street. Sal notifies Archer that curfew starts in an hour. However, Travers adds that the Nazis don't always wait for curfew, as nearby gunshots resound. Carmine and Sal don't appreciate the fact that the Nazis now dominate areas which the gangsters used to own. When Travers hints that Sal and Carmine used to be [[loan shark]]s, Sal is reluctant to tell Archer. Sal claims that he and Carmine were delegates for the [[Construction Workers Union]] before the war. When Travers informs Archer of Sal and Carmine's criminal activities, Sal is eager to continue with Archer and the other resistance fighters.   Later, Sal advises Archer not to believe too much of [[Joe Prazki]]'s claims, as Prazki is a {{dis|drunk|person}} and a [[welsher]]. Prazki informs Archer that a member of the Na'kuhl regularly seeks information from him, concerning both the resistance and the Gestapo. Because Prazki is not well-informed, he invents the stories he tells the Na'kuhl man, who always wears a hat to remain hidden. Prazki adds that he caught a glimpse of the man once, and saw that the man is an alien. The drunk is not willing to arrange a meeting with Archer and the alien until Sal offers him more [[money]]. When Prazki is still reluctant to set up the meeting, Sal threatens him.  Using the [[transporter]], Tucker and Mayweather beam into a forest near the location of the stolen shuttlepod, just outside [[New York City]]. Searching the area, they find artillery which the Nazis have been using. Tucker comments that the wooded area they have beamed into is very different from the Earth he and Mayweather are used to. When Commander Tucker detects a plasma signature, he and Mayweather start to head towards it.  In a dark alley, Sal tells Archer he is certain that the resistance effort is succeeding. The gangster remarks at the diversity of people who have joined the effort and seems particularly impressed with the aiming accuracy of some of the women resistance fighters. Archer and Sal watch a Nazi dressed in a black fedora and trenchcoat round a corner and come into full view of the Americans. Sal hands Archer a loaded gun shortly before the captain heads towards the Nazi. Because Archer is wearing a cap, the Nazi, who can only see Archer's silhouette in the dark, assumes that the captain is Joe Prazki. When the alien realizes that the silhouette actually belongs to Archer, the Nazi raises his gun. Alicia, Sal, and Carmine intervene and force the alien to surrender. When they push the Nazi into a lit section of the alley, they found out that the Nazi is actually an alien in a black fedora and trenchcoat, Carmine is shocked at the Nazi's alien appearance. The ""alien"" is Ghrath.  Meanwhile, Tucker and Mayweather have found the crashed shuttlepod, damaged and deserted. The Starfleet officers enter the craft and Tucker contacts ''Enterprise'', unsure of how badly the shuttlepod is damaged.  Elsewhere, Sal and Carmine discuss their shock at seeing the alien Nazi's appearance. While Archer searches Ghrath, he finds an alien communications device. He attempts to interrogate the alien, but Ghrath refuses to talk. Eventually, Ghrath informs Archer that the Na'kuhl know Archer is from the future and have detected ''Enterprise'' in Earth orbit. Ghrath claims that the Na'kuhl are trapped in 1944 and are using the help of the Nazis to construct a [[time conduit]] to get back. When a siren begins blaring and the shuffle of soldiers' boots approaches, Sal shoots the alien three times in the midsection, killing him, as Alicia and the men flee the scene.  ===Act Four===  Satisfied that Tucker has adequately assessed the damage to the shuttlepod, he and Mayweather walk away from the craft. Tucker contacts ''Enterprise'' and notifies T'Pol that the shuttlepod won't be able to fly for some hours. On the bridge of the starship, Reed informs T'Pol that several vehicles are approaching Mayweather and Tucker. Tucker overhears Reed and reports that ""Plan B"" is in progress. The engineer is frustrated that Silik has not been found, but T'Pol assures Tucker that the Suliban leader will be caught.  When Sal and Carmine begin to question if Archer is from the future, the captain tells them that he was born in [[Upstate New York]]. Then Archer, Travers, Sal, and Carmine grow suspicious as they realize that many people are watching them in the dark. Suddenly, the Americans are ambushed by Nazi soldiers. Carmine escapes, but Sal is gunned down in the street by [[machine gun]] fire. Archer and Travers flee in a running gun battle down an alley. There, Archer frantically tries to contact ''Enterprise'' with Ghrath's communication device, while Travers tries to shoot the pursuing Nazis, screaming at Archer that the help he's calling for will never reach them in time.  Meanwhile, Tucker has set up explosive charges in the shuttlepod, so that the Nazis won't be able to use the technology aboard the craft. A deployment of Nazi soldiers with Alsatian dogs approach, so Tucker and Mayweather hide. When the Nazis find and enter the shuttlepod, Tucker detonates the charges, destroying the craft. Mayweather and Tucker are chased down a hill by a Nazi vehicle and are soon surrounded.  On the bridge of ''Enterprise'', Malcolm reports that the damaged shuttlepod has been destroyed. Sato adds that the explosion of the shuttlepod has interrupted the starship's communication with the away team. However, she also picks up ''another'' signal &ndash; although the transmission is weak. Intrigued, T'Pol orders it put on speakers &ndash; and to the utter astonishment of everyone on the bridge, the voice on the other end is Captain Archer, having finally gotten through to the ship.   However, Archer is pinned down in the alley as Vosk approaches, ordering the two Americans to surrender, which at which point they emerge from the shadows with their hands up. Vosk informs Archer that they have much to discuss, but the captain replies that there will be another time, as he and Alicia are transported safely to the ship. Vosk furiously fires a machine gun at their previous location, realizing that Archer has escaped again.  Materializing aboard ''Enterprise'', Alicia is amazed at the capability of the transporter. When she wonders how the device works, Archer says that the transporter is complicated. She asks Archer to promise her they won't have to go through it again. Together, they step off the transporter platform and head for the bridge.  There, the crew welcomes back their captain, who asks a speechless T'Pol to brief him on ''Enterprise''{{'}}s situation.  As T'Pol and the captain walk through a corridor, the Vulcan informs Archer that the away team destroyed the shuttlepod shortly before they went missing. The captain orders the continuation of the search for Tucker and Mayweather and shows T'Pol the Na'kuhl communication device. He wants her to disassemble the device and find out how to monitor the Nazis' transmissions.  In sickbay, Daniels informs Archer that his main nemesis is Vosk, who must be destroyed, along with his time conduit, a massive device being built with [[20th century]] technology. The Na'kuhl used a one-way [[stealth]] time travel device to travel to 1944 just before Daniels and his fellow agents could capture him and are now constructing the temporal conduit to return to their own time. Archer has been sent back to this point in time because it is here (now) that Vosk can be stopped, in order to restore the proper timeline and erase the Temporal War from history. Uttering his final words &ndash; ""stop him"", which the crew now understands refers to Vosk &ndash; Daniels dies.  On Earth, Vosk informs Tucker and Mayweather that the Nazis haven't managed to detain Captain Archer. The Na'kuhl leader prepares to question the Starfleet officers as potential temporal agents. Mayweather and Tucker are led out of the room, as Vosk tells their Nazi guards that he will be ""supervising another test"".  Vosk walks through a long hall, which overlooks the massive time conduit, as production on the conduit continues posthaste.  "

Due to an apparent shortage of [[Dark Matter]], fuel prices have begun to rise, prompting [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] to prohibit flying the [[Planet Express Ship]] unless absolutely necessary. However, [[Turanga Leela|Leela]] has begun to develop anger issues, and upset about being insulted by [[Sal]], enters the ship in a [[Space Demolition Derby]], trashing the ship. As punishment, Leela is forced to wear a 50,000-volt shock collar that activates whenever she has a violent thought, uses profanity, has a sexual thought or lies.

Meanwhile, [[Bender Bending Rodríguez|Bender]] feels left out when he sees [[Cubert J. Farnsworth|Cubert]] and [[Dwight Conrad|Dwight]] playing [[Dungeons & Dragons]]: he can't play because robots are not installed with imaginations. Trying as hard as he can, Bender manages to imagine himself as a medieval knight and joins the game, naming himself [[Titanius Anglesmith]]. However, since he was never meant to have an imagination, Bender gradually believes himself to be a real knight in the magical world of [[Cornwood]]. At first, he seems harmless, until he starts causing chaos everywhere. Eventually, he crashes into Leela's parents' house, where she has brought [[John A. Zoidberg|Dr. Zoidberg]] over to dinner to prove that she has resolved her anger issues, given that he is the one with the authority to remove the collar. Leela is unable to fight back with the collar on and Zoidberg is too scared to take it off. [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] manages to trick Bender into stopping by using a 'Cone of Coldness"" against him, which his character is vulnerable to. Bender is then brought to the [[Hal Institute for Criminally Insane Robots]].

After watching [[Morbo|Morbo's]] interview with [[Mom]] on ''[[Tea With Titans]]'' on the controversy about the fuel shortage and how she's making record profits, the Professor reveals to the [[Planet Express crew]] that when he worked for Mom for the third time after realizing she was evil twice before, he tried to make dark matter into a more durable harpsichord wax. Using a particle accelerator, he created a crystal that empowered dark matter, making it a usable fuel. But when he presented this to [[Carol Miller|Mom]], she took the crystal for herself. Mom fired Hubert and left him for [[Ogden Wernstrom]], her ex-husband. However, he also created an [[Anti-Backwards Crystal|anti-backwards crystal]], that, if brought within a six-inch proximity to its sister crystal, could render dark matter useless again. Hermes points out that they would then have no fuel. Hubert says that once the universe is freed of Mom's dark matter grip, this would then compel scientists to create an alternative fuel. Unfortunately, he has forgotten where he had put it. Unknown to everyone, Dwight and Cubert have found it in the downstairs walrus tank and made it into a twelve-sided die for their game. Luckily, the Professor manages to activate a smell on the crystal that he can detect with his smelling aid, but Mom learns that the crystal still exists and sends her sons, [[Walt]], [[Larry]] and [[Ignar|Igner]] to take it back. Walt concocts a plan to enter the [[Planet Express Building]] with the three disguised as [[owl]] exterminators and Fry lets them in to care of the owls. However, Hubert challenges them to actually ''exterminate'' an owl, Igner fouls up and they lose the crystal. Taking back his crystal, Hubert sends them back to Mom.

Meanwhile, [[Dr. Perceptron]] at Hal Institute tries to put Bender through all sorts of therapies, but nothing works. Therefore, the doctor decides to give him a robotomy, the [[Robot]] equivalent of a lobotomy, to rid his mind of fantasy.

Hubert, Leela and Fry infiltrate [[Mom's dark matter mine]], fooling the [[Killbots]] into thinking that they are flying the ship, which is actually on remote control. During their infiltration, it is discovered that Leela actually likes the shock from the collar. But they soon find that the mine is actually a farm, full of [[Nibblonian]]s and Leela's beloved [[Nibbler]], who was captured by Mom's sons. The Nibblonians are being force fed chickens and prune juice, which they can't resist eating, so that they excrete dark matter. However, Nibbler is surprised that they aren't amazed that he can talk: Fry explains that he didn't erase their memories the last time and they kept him as a pet because he is cuter that way. Nibbler explains that exactly [[2972|36 years ago]], he was head of a Nibblonian outpost on [[Vergon 6]]. However, with all the dark matter they excreted into the planet, [[Democratic Order of Planets|DOOP]] began to mine the [[planet]], with the help of Mom. When the planet was sucked dry, Mom learned that Nibblonians produced dark matter and captured a ship full of them, except Nibbler, who was later kidnapped by Mom's sons when they were disguised as owl exterminators.

Suddenly, Igner spots them, directing them up the ""primary chicken valve"" to Mom's office, having been compelled by the unexplained secret Mom told his brothers. They attempt to bring the two crystals together, but Mom brings up a gun. Hubert then swallows the anti-backwards crystal so she can't get her hands on it. However, she points out that he's in a harvesting plant and orders her sons to inject prune juice into him. Suddenly, all dark matter begins to resonate, especially the stockpile Bender has in his chest cavity. Suddenly, Bender disappears, just as he was about to undergo a robotomy and everyone at the mine feels the ice floor cave beneath their feet.

Fry and Leela then come out the ground somewhere, finding the anti-backwards crystal and discovering that Leela is now a centaur, [[Leegola]]. They meet [[Titanius Anglesmith]] and learn that they are in Cornwood. Titanius treats them to roasted munchkin and entertainment by dancing [[Dwarf|dwarves]] at his castle until [[Calculon]] rides up to warn them of danger. The crew ride out and attack [[Waltazar]], [[Larry|Larius]], and [[Ignus]]. The brothers are banished when [[Frydo]] accidentally rolls the anti-backwards crystal, or the [[Die of Power]] as they call it in Cornwood. Frydo and company meet [[the Great Wizard Greyfarn]], who tells them that [[Momon]] had created a set of dice from the living plastic in the [[Geysers of Gygax]]. Momon put too much of her power into the Die of Power and subsequently lost it. To defeat her, they must journey to her lands to destroy it in the lake of plastic.

As they begin their quest, they come upon a tribe of centaurs, led by the intersexual, pacifist [[Hermes Conrad|Hermaphrodite]]. Leegola is excited that her people, as a group of well-trained archers, can defeat Momon's armies. However, the centaurs are opposed to fighting and try to refuse them passage through their territory. Leegola stands up to Hermaphrodite and takes his bow and arrows. The group arrives at the [[Cave of Hopelessness]], guarded by a huge ogre. [[Gynecaladriel]], queen of the water nymphos, joins their quest and seduces the ogre, putting him to sleep. As they enter the cave, they meet a large, centipede-esque creature, Zoidberg, whom they presume to be the [[Tunneling Horror]]. Leegola brutally assaults him, eating his two hearts. Unfortunately, they learn that he is not the Tunneling Horror. Horrified that she had tried to kill an innocent creature, Leela runs off and joins the centaurs to learn their peaceful ways. Suddenly, the real Tunneling Horror arrives, but Frydo defeats it after rolling the die, causing him to grow. Greyfarn warns him not to be seduced by the die's power, but Frydo degenerates into a crawling [[Wikipedia:Gollum|Gollum-like]] creature, who is obsessed with the die and eventually runs off after a failed attempt to kill his friends. The crew decides to seek help at [[Wipe Castle]] in getting past Momon's armies, but the king, [[Roberto]], has sent his men out on a pointless suicide mission, forcing the crew to defend the castle themselves. Also, Momon had overheard them going to Wipe Castle before Frydo left them and sends Waltazar and Larius with all their armies to attack the castle, refusing to leave a small contingent behind.

A declaration of war is announced and Leegola takes control of the centaur herd after beating up Hermaphrodite, refusing to participate in a tedious debate. She leads her armies to Wipe Castle, slaughtering Momon's legions. Gynecaladriel ""repays"" Leegola by making out with her. Just then, they notice two volcanoes erupting, meaning that Frydo is engaged in battle with Momon. However, Titanius suggests that they wait while watching Gynecaladriel and Leegola make out.

Frydo, accompanied by the still living head of Zoidberg, arrives in Momon's lair. But he is too compelled by the power of the die to destroy it, so Zoidberg bites him. Momon becomes a dragon to get the die, but it grants Frydo ""Mirror Mania"", allowing him to mimic her dragon form. While they battle, his friends arrive, who are descending along a fragile staircase, which Momon destroys. Ignus, riding a giant spider, which he thinks is a bug, urges them to hop on his mount. Greyfarn yells at him for his incompetence and duels Ignus in a lightstick fight. Ignus breaks it off, revealing that that he is in fact his son, which Greyfarn tries to deny, repeatedly hitting himself with his staff. Meanwhile, Frydo and Momon incapacitate each other when they hit the other's soft underbelly, reverting themselves to human form. Zoidberg then grabs the die. At first, he thinks to destroy it, but becomes corrupted by it. However, Momon seizes the die after Greyfarn squishes Zoidberg and all of Cornwood goes black, with the ground beneath everyone's feet collapsing.

Suddenly, the crew and Mom and her sons end up back at the mine. The Professor explains that the dark matter resonance in Bender's chest, coupled with his imagination, created Cornwood. Unfortunately, Mom isn't interested in his explanations and once again orders Walt and Larry to inject prune juice into Hubert's stomach, where the anti-backwards crystal still is. However, Hubert asks for one last thing: a hug with his son, Igner. Igner has swallowed Mom's crystal and their hug effectively destroys the two crystals, rendering all dark matter useless. Hubert quickly comes up with an alternative fuel, known as ""nibbler power"". Holding a chicken on a fishing pole just out of the harnessed Nibblonians' reach, Hubert has them drag the Planet Express ship and crew back home.

==Summary==
===Introduction===
It is a restless night aboard [[Babylon 5]]. Very soon, President [[John Sheridan]] and [[Delenn]] will leave the station for [[Tuzanor]], [[Minbar]], the new seat of the [[Interstellar Alliance]]. Sheridan walks into [[C&C]] to find Captain [[Elizabeth Lochley]] on station, just as restless as he. Lochley comments on just how quickly her first year in command has gone, asking where the time goes. Sheridan suggests [[Galactic Rim|the Rim]], and beyond that ""the truth."" At this point, Sheridan makes a request: when he and Delenn leave for Minbar, dispense with the pomp and circumstance. Lochley thanks Sheridan for choosing her to command Babylon 5, noting that despite her earlier misgiving, the place ""kind of grows on you."" Sheridan agrees, which is why he is so reluctant to leave. Lochley is about to leave for a quick breakfast before the station opens for traffic when Sheridan decides to thank her for keeping the place running; he feels he has left the station in good hands.

[[Vir Cotto]] is walking down the ambassadorial wing when he notices [[Ta'Lon]] ringing the doorbell to [[G'Kar]]'s quarters. Cotto informs Ta'Lon that G'Kar has already left never to return. Ta'Lon is confused since G'Kar had summoned him here. So he decides to hack his way into the quarters. Upon entering, he discovers that his entrance was expected. The [[BabCom]] unit recognizes him and informs him of a message waiting for him from G'Kar. Playing it, he sees G'Kar greeting Ta'Lon, apologizing for his absence since he had decided to leave sooner than expected, and declaring that he has summoned Ta'Lon to take his place as Ambassador for the [[Narn Regime]].

===Act I===
G'Kar's message continues. He explains that over the last year, he has become a magnet for trouble. Their people's perception of him has become distorted, so he feels it is best to distance himself from them. [[Narn]] needs equal doses of strength and spirit, and he has frankly become too much of the latter. It is time for a dose of strength to even the scales. He notes Ta'Lon as being sensible, level-headed, and practical, not to mention very loyal to and very sensitive to the needs of Narns. This makes him an ideal candidate for the post at a time when Narn needs to rebuild itself and strengthen its ties with the Interstellar Alliance. G'Kar also reassures Ta'Lon that while he may not feel ready for the job, there was a time when G'Kar was himself raw and unpolished at the job as well; give it time, he suggests, and he'll get the hang of it. Upon completion of the message, a copy will be relayed to Sheridan and company; Ta'Lon will be received as they would G'Kar. He ends by wishing Ta'Lon the best.

: ''""Serve our people reasonably, fairly, and with honor. The rest will tend to itself.""''

Dr. [[Stephen Franklin]] sits down with his fellow Dr. [[Lillian Hobbs]] in the [[Zócalo]]. Here, Franklin announces that he has chosen her to be the station's new Chief of Staff. Hobbs wonders why she was chosen, as there are many more senior doctors on staff while she has been bounced between Medlabs. Franklin explains her roving provides just the reason. Most of the senior staff are specialists; Hobbs has a broader base of medical knowledge, making her better suited to ''lead'' the team. Hobbs appreciates the compliment and notes Franklin's speeding things along. He explains that the new appointment is effective today; he intends to leave tonight for [[Earth]] and his new position as head of Xenobiology Research. As he notices Sheridan step out of a [[transport tube]], he gets up to tell the news to him next. Hobbs looks on as Sheridan listens and then embraces Franklin, wishing him well. The two then walk together down the hall.

In her quarters, Delenn finishes packing the last of hers and Sheridan's belongings when the doorbell rings. To her surprise, it is [[Lennier]], on a brief break from his [[Anla'Shok]] training and here on a ""working holiday"" to help load their boxes. Delenn is pleased to be able to take a short break and hear of news from home. As she prepares a drink, Lennier looks at a framed picture of Sheridan and Delenn, taken shortly after their marriage.

In his office, new head of [[ISA Covert Intelligence]] [[Tessa Halloran]] reports that, apart from a minor flareup between the [[Drazi]] and [[Brakiri]] over a seedy layover planet on their border, the situation is relatively quiet, meaning he can make the transition to Minbar without any ongoing trouble. As Halloran leaves, Lochley notes she is staying at Babylon 5. Sheridan explains that the station remains a focal point for information; she'll be better informed by staying. That's one reason [[Michael Garibaldi]] chose to resign: so he would be free to move to Mars with his new wife [[Lise Hampton-Edgars]]. Chief [[Zack Allan]] wonders what he is doing now.

What Garibaldi is doing now is introducing himself to the ''new'' Board of Directors at [[Edgars Industries]]. He is now in charge of day-to-day operations, and he explains why he chose his new board; all of them are firebrands, mid-level workers with a history of being ""troublemakers"". Basically, they can't help but be frank when there is a problem, so he is shaking things up, giving them a chance to prove themselves. His rules are simple: if something is wrong, ''tell him''. If they're right, they will earn a bonus. If not, he'll have them for lunch.

Franklin walks into the docking bay for the last time. He takes one last look back at the station before boarding a shuttle from which he will begin the trip back to Earth.

===Act II===
[[ISN]], to Sheridan's chagrin, has been quick to pick up on the importance of a [[White Star class]] ship arriving at Babylon 5. It is obviously here to take Sheridan and Delenn to Minbar. Sheridan hates it since it means they cannot leave quietly. When the doorbell rings, Sheridan opens the door. In steps Lennier, informing them that packing is complete and that they can leave as soon as they board. Delenn asks to take a last look through the room in case she missed anything. Left alone, Sheridan thanks Lennier for coming. As they talk, Lennier informs him that he must return to training soon after arriving on Minbar. Sheridan invites him to come over at any time. Hesitantly, Lennier accepts the invitation. Delenn returns to report nothing missing. So, taking her arm, Sheridan begins the walk to the docking bay.

But upon reaching the Zócalo, he is further chagrined to see Lochley and a sizable number of people waiting for them. They'd seen the ISN report as well. Finding himself unable to say anything, Sheridan defers to Delenn, who does have a few words. She tells of the time when she first came to Babylon 5, learning how to speak the alien languages: particularly the human language that was the standard on board. She notes there is one Human word for which there is no Minbari equivalent: ""goodbye"", as the Minbari mindset always allows for the possibility of meeting again, somehow. Even now, as she prepares to leave Babylon 5, she will not say it now, instead essentially saying, ""Until we meet again.""

Allan awaits them at the docking bay. He was a bit late due to a dustup in [[Brown Sector]], but he still wanted to see them off. Sheridan notes it is nice that not everyone is leaving. Allan quips he will probably still be on B5 ""when they turn off the lights."" Lochley joins Allan as Sheridan, Delenn, and Lennier head for the shuttle.

Delenn is surprised to see the ship without a captain. Lennier informs them that the captain is staying so that Sheridan and Delenn can command the flight. Sheridan appreciates the symbolism. As he looks out the front window, Sheridan orders the ship to match rotation with the station. The ship's front window aligns with the C&C window. Looking out across the emptiness, he sees faces new and old looking back at him: [[David Corwin]], remaining at his post; Tessa Halloran, new head of Covert Intelligence; Vir Cotto, new Centauri Ambassador; Elizabeth Lochley, standing CO; Zack Allan, standing Chief of Security; Ta'Lon, new Narn Ambassador; and Dr. Hobbs, new Medlab Chief of Staff. In a final sendoff, Lochley steps forward and delivers the [[Earthforce]] salute, which Sheridan returns from the White Star. Upon finishing, he orders the ship away.

En route, Delenn notes Sheridan to be rather restless, in spite of his saying otherwise. She suggests taking a walk. After some reluctance, he decides to do so. Meanwhile, a Ranger on board notices something wrong. There is a hissing sound and some smoke emitting from an opening. The Ranger quickly warns of a coolant leak in the weapons systems as he begins efforts to stop the leak. It is as the alarm rings through the ship that Sheridan notices the commotion and rushes in, unaware of the ongoing problem. Just as the Ranger warns of the danger, the door automatically seals off: an automatic safety measure due to the increasing contamination. Sheridan is now trapped inside. Just then, Lennier happens upon the scene. Sheridan asks Lennier to override the lock from the outside, but he hesitates. In spite of Sheridan's pleas, he backs away, leaving him behind.

===Act III===
Sheridan realizes that Lennier is not going to help him, so he decides to take action himself. He rummages through the now-unconscious Ranger and finds his [[denn'bok|fighting pike]]. He opens it and tries to bash the door down. Meanwhile, Lennier pauses in a hallway, as if reconsidering his actions. Sheridan then hits upon an idea. Closing the pike, he wedges it between the door and a wall and opens it again. The action causes the pike to break through the glass. Lennier finally decides to double back, but by this time Sheridan has already carried the unconscious Ranger out of the room. Other Rangers and crew soon enter the scene as well. As Sheridan stares at him, Lennier realizes that he has just committed a very shameful act. Delenn then enters and asks what happened. Lennier's panic grows as he realizes he must now answer to her as well. But he cannot; how can he admit his shame before her? He runs away instead, taking a fighter and abandoning the ship. Delenn tries to contact Lennier. She tells him she knows what happened, but that they are willing to talk about it. Lennier cuts off the transmission and disappears into [[hyperspace]].

Later, Delenn talks to Sheridan about the ongoing investigation. In Lennier's quarters on Tuzanor was his diary. In it was evidence that his love for Delenn was even stronger than he had admitted. More importantly, it showed he ''did not'' approve of her marriage to Sheridan. Although the diary noted that he intended no real harm to him, it is obvious Lennier succumbed to a moment of hate and tried to leave Sheridan to die. It is also obvious that Lennier now regrets that moment and has fled in shame. Sheridan ''is'' angry at this and wants Lennier to be held accountable for that fact, but in spite of his own misgivings, he's willing to at least try to make amends. Sheridan is coughing from his exposure to the coolant gases, and Delenn recommends they delay their arrival, but Sheridan insists they arrive on time. They have an image to uphold. He'll just say he caught a cold. As for what happened with Lennier, he will keep it secret. Not only will it help maintain their image again, but it will allow Lennier time to come to terms and return on his own. Delenn appreciates Sheridan's capacity to forgive him.

The White Star arrives on Minbar and lands on the space port in Tuzanor. To their surprise, Sheridan and Delenn find someone waiting for them upon their arrival at the presidential suite: [[Emperor of the Centauri Republic|Emperor]] [[Londo Mollari]].

===Act IV===
Mollari joins Sheridan and Delenn for dinner that night, and he talks about some of the benefits of being in power: such as seeing the dismay on the faces of your enemies. Delenn then notes that his demeanor the last time they met (on [[Centauri Prime]], just after it was attacked) was far from civil or cordial to them. Londo says his words were directed towards his people, not them. He had been firing them up for the task of rebuilding their capital. Outside of his people, he can return to his more-friendly words. And upon hearing of their moving to Minbar, he decided to pay a state visit to convey his well wishes. Although he finds it disappointing there is no alcohol to be had (owing to the Minbari's sensitivity to it). His status prevents him from keeping his own stash. Delenn then senses something very strange... as if something else was watching her in secret. Londo then turns to them and presents to them a gift: an antique urn. He also knows that Delenn is with child, and the gift is meant for their future child. He claims that it is a Centauri custom to present this to the heir to the throne when he comes of age. He adds that he does not expect to he have any children of his own, and that the Centauri may be abolishing the office of Emperor after his death, so he feels it best to pass on the tradition to the Alliance. Just then, a Minbari summons Delenn on a matter of some urgency, and she excuses herself from the room. Mollari continues to explain the tradition to Sheridan. It is to be turned over when their child turns 16. Sheridan notes the bottom of the urn is sealed. Mollari says it contains water from the time of the first Centauri palace 2000 years ago.

The urgent matter for Delenn is a message from Lennier. She is taking it in private so they may speak freely. Lennier explains that he cannot talk long and that he cannot be traced. Delenn tries to explain that he can return, but refuses. His shame is too great. All he can do at this point is apologize and stay away. Before he can seek their forgiveness, he must find redemption. He does make one promise, the same one Minbari imply when they part ways: ""We will meet again, Delenn.""

Soon, Mollari has to return to Centauri Prime. Before he goes, he admits that they are still his friends, and that this visit means more to him than they realize. Sheridan and Delenn note that his way of leaving seemed odd, as if he does not expect to ever see them again. Sheridan then asks about Delenn's mysterious caller. He realizes that it has been Lennier, and Delenn says she will explain later when they are alone.

Aboard the Centauri cruiser, Emperor Mollari hears the voice of the [[Drakh]] through his [[Keeper]], praising him for a job well done. For this service, the Drakh allow him an hour's respite from them. He accepts a drink and asks what happens now. The Drakh explain that now they wait. Their plan will take nearly two decades to bear fruit, but they are patient. Inside the urn they have given Sheridan and Delenn through Mollari is another Keeper: one intended for the unsuspecting couple's child. It sleeps, waiting...

===Act V===
Later that night, Sheridan cannot sleep. He gets up and goes to another room. There, he begins to record a message. It is a time capsule message meant for his unborn child to hear in the future. If the lease on life given to him by [[Lorien]] holds, he will not live to see his child come of age in human terms, he only has 19 years left. So instead, he will leave this message. He promises to give his child the same love he has given Delenn for as long as he can. And then, he proceeds to give what wisdom he can pass on. He says to trust Delenn; she is a pillar of both courage and compassion. He says to expect missteps and mistakes, just as Garibaldi did; just learn from them like he did and you can grow from the experience. He says there may be times when you will take a great journey, like Franklin on his way to Earth. But it is your passion that tells you you're home. He talks about gaining and losing friends; they are all part of the learning process. Change is a part of life; if the time comes to part ways, do not fight it. Everyone has his or her own journey to make. Finally, he conveys his greatest belief: that sooner or later, things will work themselves out. The journey may be long and hard, but you'll get there in the end. Stand for what you believe. He then conveys the wisdom of his father [[David Sheridan|David]]. ""Never start a fight, but always finish it,"" Delenn volunteers. As he ends the recording, Delenn bids him return to bed. He finally feels ready to sleep, so he follows her.

==Summary==
===Teaser===
The {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701}} is diverted three [[light year]]s off of its scheduled course to [[Planet Q]], lured by word of a new synthetic food which promises to ease chronic shortages on [[Cygnia Minor]]. But what [[Doctor]] [[Thomas Leighton]] actually wants to show his childhood friend [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]] is merely a traveling Shakespearean actor, [[Anton Karidian]]. Leighton believes Karidian to actually be [[Kodos|Kodos the Executioner]].

===Act One===
Kodos is notorious because he seized control of the doomed [[Tarsus IV|Earth Colony Tarsus IV]] in [[2246]] and ordered the execution of half its population of 8,000. Of the 4,000 survivors, [[Tarsus IV survivors 001|only nine]], including the young Kirk and Leighton, ever saw the face of the revolutionary governor.

Though convinced [[Tarsus IV corpse 001|Kodos is long dead]], Kirk does enough research to pique his curiosity about Leighton's claim. He returns to the planet in hopes of meeting Karidian in person. At a [[cocktail party]] held at the Leightons' home, Kirk meets Karidian's attractive daughter [[Lenore Karidian|Lenore]], and the two hit it off. They leave the party to stroll in Planet Q's desert, and come upon the body of their host Thomas Leighton.

Leighton's death makes Kirk take his dead friend's suspicions more seriously. After promising Leighton's distraught wife [[Martha Leighton|Martha]] that he will find out why her husband was killed, Kirk calls in a favor: he asks [[Jon Daily]], [[commanding officer]] of the ''[[Astral Queen]]'', to leave Planet Q orbit ahead of schedule and without notice. This strands the Karidian Players, who now have no choice but to ask for passage aboard the ''Enterprise''.

===Act Two===
Researching, Kirk reviews the list of the nine eyewitnesses, and discovers that [[Lieutenant]] [[Kevin Riley]], a member of the ''Enterprise'' crew, is one of them. Despite the fact that Riley recently was promoted from [[engineering]] to [[communications]], Kirk orders Spock to send Riley back down to engineering with the apparent intention of protecting him. When Spock asks why, pointing out that such action may be regarded by Riley as a demotion, Kirk refuses to explain.

Spock becomes concerned about the captain's behavior and confides in Dr. [[Leonard McCoy|McCoy]], while Kirk proceeds to get more involved with Lenore. Spock does his own research and learns enough to raise his own suspicions, including the disturbing fact that of the nine eyewitnesses who could positively identify Kodos, seven are now dead. And whenever one died, the Karidian Players were somewhere nearby. Only Kirk and Lieutenant Riley remain alive.

With a tray of food at his side Riley broods while alone in engineering and calls up the [[recreation room|rec room]] pleading for company. [[Lieutenant]] [[Larry Matson]] turns over the [[intercom]] to [[Nyota Uhura|Uhura]], who serenades him by playing a [[Vulcan lute|Vulcan harp]] and singing ""[[Beyond Antares]]"". While Riley is distracted by her performance, someone sneaks into the room and emerges from the shadows to squirt something into his glass of [[milk]]. His spirits brightened, Riley reaches for his drink and takes a long gulp. Uhura finishes her song and Riley begins choking. Fortunately, Uhura's party realizes the situation and sends help in time to save him.

As Riley lies in critical condition on a [[bio-bed]], Spock realizes that if he dies, Kirk will be the next target.

===Act Three===
In McCoy's lab report on Riley's condition, he finds that the lieutenant had an appreciable amount of [[tetra-lubisol]] in his system, a milky lubricant used aboard the ''Enterprise''. Spock is now certain that Riley was poisoned and with a reluctant McCoy confront Kirk in his [[quarters]]. Spock is now certain Karidian and Kodos are the same man, but Kirk remains unsure and has to make certain of it. McCoy asks Kirk what he will do ''if'' Kodos and Karidian are one and the same, inquiring if he will carry his head through the ship's [[corridor]]s in triumph, noting that will not bring back any of the dead colonists. Kirk agrees but notes that ""they may rest easier."" Later, a similar discussion Kirk and Spock have is interrupted by the hum of an overloading [[phaser]]. Somewhere in Kirk's quarters is a potential explosive that can take out the entire deck. While Spock orders ship's personnel to clear the area, Kirk finds the overloading phaser in his quarters' [[red alert]] indicator and disposes of it seconds before it explodes.

Kirk is finally driven to confront Karidian, asking him point blank whether he is Kodos. Karidian gives him evasive answers, and after twenty years of playing parts that, of all things, he is tired. He does perform a short speech for the purposes of voice comparison with a piece of [[voice film]] in the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s database. This was apparently the speech made by Kodos condemning thousands of innocent people to death. Kirk mentions how Karidian barely looked at the text, hinting that it was already familiar to the actor, but Karidian simply states that he learns his parts quickly. Meanwhile, in [[sickbay]], the recovering Lieutenant Riley overhears McCoy's log entry, learning that Karidian is suspected of being Kodos, the man who [[murder]]ed Riley's family.

===Act Four===
The [[voiceprint]] comparison is close, very close, but Kirk argues that when a man's life is at stake, very close isn't good enough.

The Karidian Players begin a presentation of ''[[Hamlet]]''. Riley, with a stolen phaser, sneaks backstage. Kirk manages to talk him out of killing Karidian, who overhears their ''sotto voce'' conversation. Riley, with great reluctance, heads back to sickbay.

Kirk is still backstage when Karidian and his daughter Lenore discuss what he overheard during an act break. Trying to shield her from his past, Karidian attempts to pass off his distress as hearing the ""voice of a part that he played long ago"". But he is horrified when Lenore lovingly reveals that she knows all about his past deeds, and has already killed seven of the nine people who could identify him. Lenore goes on to tell him, innocently, that she will dispose of the remaining two after the performance.

Karidian is horrified that there is still more blood on ""his"" hands, but she proclaims that ""they had to be silenced"", and says, all with a smile on her face, that she buried those ghosts for him, and she has ""saved"" him. Karidian is devastated that all his attempts to prevent his past crimes from tainting his daughter have failed, and left him with nothing but a long legacy of murder.

Kirk appears from his hiding place to confront them. Lenore rebukes Kirk for interrupting her father before his appearance on stage. Kirk says she has killed seven innocent people, and she declares to Kirk that those people weren't innocent, they were ""dangerous"", and that she would have killed a world to protect her father.

Kirk summons [[security]] to take them into custody; Lenore snatches security officer [[Harrison]]'s weapon and runs on stage. Her eyes show she's quite insane (reminiscent of Lady Macbeth and/or Ophelia). Karidian/Kodos, desperate there should be no more blood on his hands, steps between her and Kirk as she fires; the shot is fatal. Twenty years after earning the name, Kodos the Executioner is dead.

The death of her beloved father at her own hands sends Lenore over the edge. By the time Kirk leads her away, her tears have given way to laughter. Sometime later, after the performers have been dropped off at Benecia, McCoy promises Lenore will get the best of care, and that the last report of her is that she believes her father is still alive&hellip; performing to cheering audiences. McCoy suggests that Kirk did care for Lenore, which Kirk does not respond to, instead giving the order for Lieutenant [[Leslie]] to break orbit and go to warp. He does give McCoy a knowing look, which is all the answer the doctor needs.

==Short Summary==
A failed comedian who voices a popular cartoon bear named Waldo finds himself mixing in politics when TV executives want Waldo to run for office.

==Full Summary==
[[Jamie Salter]] (Daniel Rigby) is a failed comedian who performs the voice and movements (via performance capture) of a blue cartoon bear named Waldo, who interviews and embarrasses politicians and other authority figures. The interviewees are fooled into thinking the Waldo interviews are for a children's TV program when they're actually for a late-night, topical comedy show. Waldo the bear is extremely popular with the viewers and he is given his own spin-off series, but despite the character's success Jamie is depressed and unsatisfied with his life.

During a brain-storming session for the Waldo pilot, producer Jack Napier (Jason Flemyng), who owns the rights to Waldo, jokingly suggests that Waldo should compete against real politicians in an upcoming by-election in the town of Stentonford, so he can stand against one of his past interviewees, Conservative candidate Liam Monroe (Tobias Menzies). Jamie at first opposes the idea, worried about entering the world of politics, but he soon reluctantly agrees to go ahead with the plan. The production company heads off on a campaign trail, projecting Waldo onto a screen on the side of a van and driving to wherever Monroe is campaigning so Waldo can publicly humiliate him. During the campaign, Jamie meets Gwendolyn Harris (Chloe Pirrie), the by-election's Labour candidate who, despite having no chance of winning, is entering the by-election to further her own political career. Jamie and Gwendolyn grow close and they have a one-night stand, but afterward, Gwendolyn is warned by her campaign manager to keep away from Jamie during the campaign. Jamie can't understand why she is avoiding him, and develops a disdain for career politicians.

On a TV panel show with every party candidate as a guest, Monroe mocks both Waldo and Jamie, taunting him by saying Waldo is nothing more than a joke and Jamie himself hasn't achieved anything in his comedy career. This aggravation causes Jamie to angrily rant at every candidate on the panel, accusing them of being more artificial than Waldo is, viciously exposing that Gwendolyn is using the by-election only to boost her own image and stating that the public has lost faith in politicians. Jamie is later embarrassed by his outburst, but the rant becomes a hit on YouTube and Waldo gains more public support while Gwendolyn's campaign quickly falters and the Labour party distances itself from her. Both Jamie and Napier meet with an American (who introduces himself as a member of ""the agency"") who claims that due to his independent stance, Waldo has the potential to become a global authority figure, much to the disdain of Jamie. After a heated argument with Napier, Jamie opts to leave the campaign. He tries to apologise to Gwendolyn for his actions, but she turns him away, enraged that he has damaged her career. On the final day of the campaign trail, Jamie rejoins but is overwhelmed by guilt and breaks down at a rally, begging the public not to vote for Waldo, leaving the van and trying to smash the screen. Napier takes over Waldo's controls and orders the public to attack Jamie. On the day of the election, Jamie watches the results from a hospital bed; Monroe wins, with Waldo (now voiced by Napier) coming second and Gwendolyn coming third. Napier prompts the audience to riot.

During the end credits, Jamie is shown to have become homeless and is living on the street. He sees Waldo on a nearby monitor displaying what are assumed to be political ads on a global scale and angrily throws a bottle at the screen, which leads to him being assaulted by two police officers.

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0," == Summary == === Teaser === With [[phaser]]s trained on [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]], [[Kira Nerys|Kira]], and [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]], [[Calvin Hudson]] comments with amusement upon Sisko's shock at seeing him.  Sisko says that he had hardly recognized Hudson out of his {{dis|Starfleet uniform|2350s-2370s|uniform}}, which Hudson claims has felt a little tight recently. Hudson’s casual discarding of it causes Sisko to reminisce about the [[day]] he put it on, when they graduated from [[Starfleet Academy]].  The pair then recall their aspirations to become [[captain]]s and [[admiral]]s by the ages of thirty and forty respectively.  However, Hudson claims to now have a better cause: the [[Maquis]]. He feels he cannot turn his back on the settlers, as he considers the [[Federation]] has done. Sisko counters that Hudson's joining the Maquis has actually endangered lives and the [[Federation-Cardassian Treaty|treaty]], but Hudson believes the [[Cardassian]]s aren't honoring the document, though he has no evidence to support this.  Sisko demands the return of [[Gul]] [[Dukat]], to which Hudson accuses Sisko of siding with the Cardassians over him. According to Hudson, the Maquis's top priority is peace but insists the Cardassians' crimes cannot go unpunished, and Sisko points out that it is revenge, not peace, they seek. ""''I prefer to call it ''retaliation'',''"" Hudson smirks. After Sisko declines his offer to join the Maquis, the Maquis [[stun]] him, Kira, and Bashir. Hudson tells his fellow compatriots that they should leave immediately; knowing Sisko's temper, he doesn’t wish to be around when his friend regains consciousness.  ===Act One=== [[Admiral]] [[Alynna Nechayev|Nechayev]] is waiting for Sisko in his office when he returns to [[Deep Space 9]], and [[Jadzia Dax|Dax]] informs him that a [[Legate]] [[Parn]] of [[Cardassian Central Command]] will be arriving soon as well. As well as expressing concerns that Odo is not suitable for the position as head of station security, Nechayev refers to the Maquis as ""a bunch of irresponsible hotheads"" and tells Sisko to talk to them as, since they're still Federation citizens, they should be willing to listen to reason.  Nechayev's views leave Sisko fuming and he tells Kira what he feels is the real problem: [[Earth]]. Kira is confused, as Sisko explains that on Earth there is no crime or poverty nor war and it is easy to be a good person in [[paradise]]. For the people in the [[demilitarized zone]], however, there are still many problems and they're doing whatever they have to in order to survive, all while [[Starfleet Command]] still expects them to be 'saints'. Kira appreciates and supports Sisko's true understanding of the situation, and informs him that Legate Parn has just arrived on the station. He is on his way to greet the Cardassian leader when [[Odo]] reports that he has caught ""one of the [[Vulcan]]'s accomplices.""   Sisko arrives in the security office to find [[Quark]] in a holding cell. Quark attempts to evade discussion of his business with [[Sakonna]] but eventually reveals that he arranged for the Maquis to acquire weapons from the [[Pygorian]]s. While he had not heard of the Maquis at the time, he is sure Sakonna plans to execute her plans within the next few days. Legate Parn, upon meeting with Sisko, informs him and Kira that the Cardassian Central Command has discovered Dukat to be the leader of ""a small group of misguided officers"" who were smuggling weapons to the demilitarized zone. However, neither Sisko nor Kira believe him. Sisko concludes the Command is, in fact, arming their colonists. Hudson was right.  Afterward, Dax reports that three Federation citizens have been killed on [[Hakton VII]] in retaliation for the destruction of the ''[[Bok'Nor]]''. Focusing on Dukat, [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]] discovers the [[subspace distortion]] of the Maquis ship's [[warp drive]] and reconstructs their probable course. Sisko immediately leaves on the {{USS|Rio Grande}} to rescue Dukat, along with Bashir and Odo. Kira however believes Sisko should leave Dukat at the mercy of the Maquis with him ""getting exactly what he deserves"". Sisko tells her before he leaves that ""the Central Command wants him dead. That's reason enough for us to want him alive"".  ===Act Two=== On one of the Maquis worlds, Sakonna attempts to establish a Vulcan [[mind meld]] with Dukat, however, it is unsuccessful. Dukat attributes it to his mental discipline and boasts about Cardassian methods of information extraction. He starts to openly mock his captors for thinking themselves renegades, and considers they lack the commitment required to do what is necessary. [[Amaros]] cites the ''Bok'Nor''{{'}}s destruction as proof of their resolve, but Dukat remains unimpressed. He counters that anyone can destroy a ship, but to look their enemy in the eye, ""''knowing you'll remember his face for the rest of your life''"", takes a stomach that the Maquis don't have. Sakonna concurs with Dukat's assertion that the Maquis lack the Cardassians’ ""gift"" for inflicting pain, one which they wouldn’t want. Amaros loses patience and comes down to continue the interrogation himself. Just then, Sisko, Bashir, and Odo arrive, wanting to talk and work together on revealing the Cardassian plot. There is a momentary standoff, during which Dukat grows impatient. ""''Shoot them!''"" he yells and knocks Sakonna over, triggering a firefight. The Maquis are arrested, but Sisko allows Amaros to go free with a message to Cal Hudson that it is not too late to settle things peacefully, as he has not informed Starfleet of Hudson's actions. Sisko also tells Amaros to inform Hudson that Sisko still has his uniform and that he can have it back whenever he wants.  ===Act Three=== They bring Dukat back to Deep Space 9, where he enjoys a fulfilling meal in his quarters. Sisko arrives to talk to him. Discussing the fate of the prisoners, Sisko tells they'll be tried for their crimes under the [[Federation Code of Justice]] and released if acquitted. Dukat finds this barbaric and says that in a Cardassian trial the verdict is known beforehand. He responds to Sisko's inquiry that they may mistakenly try the innocent by claiming ""Cardassians don't make mistakes."" Dukat then inquires about the fact that [[Federation]], not Cardassian, forces rescued him. Sisko tells Dukat about Legate Parn turning him into a scapegoat to be executed ""after a comforting trial."" Dukat processes this briefly, and mentions he predicted this strained relationship with the Command since the end of the [[Occupation of Bajor]]. Dukat then offers to help Sisko stop the smuggling if he helps to stop the Maquis, and he agrees, believing for the moment that Dukat didn't know about the Command's plan. He invites Dukat to their next staff meeting.   The next day in [[Operations center|Ops]], Odo has obtained an extensive list of weapons Sakonna bought from Quark, but he has been unable to find out more from Sakonna herself. The crew focus on the weapons smuggling instead for the time being. With Dukat's help, they find a [[Xepolite Free Trader]], impervious to scanners and with a faster engine than the runabout. After initially not responding to [[hail]]s, O'Brien fires off its bow, and a trader named [[Drofo Awa]] hails them with a phony story involving his large shipment of [[Regreein wheat]] [[husk]]s. After Sisko tries to convince him to let them search the ship, Dukat interjects, using his authority and forcefulness to talk the man down. He lowers his [[shield]]s and allows them to detain a shipment of weapons from him, finally obtaining proof of the conspiracy. Dukat sits back down, pleased to gain a small amount of trust from the group.  ===Act Four=== Back on the station, Quark and Sakonna are sharing a holding cell. He calls her position with the Maquis illogical; she scoffs at the idea that a Ferengi can display superior logic to a Vulcan, but Quark quotes the Third [[Rules of Acquisition|Rule of Acquisition]] to her, ''""never spend more for an acquisition than you have to.""'' The Maquis, and Sakonna, want to ""acquire"" peace in the Demilitarized Zone, and now that the Central Command's plan has been exposed, the two sides &ndash; the Maquis and the Cardassian settlers &ndash; are in stalemate, and ''""peace can be bought at a bargain price.""'' But if the Maquis escalate the conflict, then peace with the Cardassians will become that much more ""expensive"". Quark challenges her to fault the logic in his argument. To her (muted) astonishment, she cannot.  Meanwhile, Sisko explains that the Maquis are going to attack what they believe to be a weapons depot hidden in a civilian center on one of the colonies, though Sakonna doesn't know which one. Sisko believes her, as Vulcans don't lie as a rule. Dukat challenges that, but takes it for granted for the moment. He ensures the Cardassian Central Command is not aware of this, and takes it on to find out where the depot is located himself.   In the meantime, Sisko visits Cal Hudson one final time, interrupting a council meeting. He bluntly says if they attack the depot, they endanger the treaty, and therefore become enemies of the Federation. He will stop the Maquis if they approach the depot. He tells Hudson they stopped the weapons smuggling, and that there's no need for the Maquis, but Hudson ignores it, saying they're in a war, and he intends to win even if he has to fight Sisko. Sisko brings along Hudson's discarded Starfleet uniform, which Hudson vaporizes with a phaser before he leaves the room, letting Sisko know definitively where he now stands.  ===Act Five=== Dukat says he believes the depot is on the [[Bryma Colony]]. They'll have to intercept outside its sensor range, so the colony doesn't call for reinforcements. O'Brien says they'll need to establish sensor probes in the system's [[Oort cloud]] to detect them, since they don't know what route they will take.    The crew is waiting in [[runabout]]s ''Rio Grande'', {{USS|Mekong}} and {{USS|Orinoco}} when the Maquis arrive at the depot. As neither Hudson nor Sisko wants to hurt the other, the resulting dogfight is relatively slow paced and targets are only auxiliary systems. Soon, the ''Mekong'', ''Orinoco'' and one of the [[Federation attack fighter|fighter]]s are out of the fight. Sisko's runabout and Hudson's fighter are alone, and each try to disable the other. Hudson manages to knock out Sisko's engines, but his own [[phaser]]s are disabled. Despite Sisko's plea, Hudson flees and, over, Dukat's strong objections, Sisko allows him to escape, refusing to kill someone for trying to defend his home. Dukat expresses his disappointment, but Sisko curtly tells him he will not lose sleep over it.   In his office, he confides in Kira after reading his congratulatory message from Starfleet. Kira says he deserves credit for preventing a war. But Sisko can only wonder if this is true, or whether he has merely delayed the inevitable. "
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"  == Summary == === Teaser ===  [[Captain]] [[Kathryn Janeway]] walks through a [[corridor]] on her way to a [[turbolift]] when [[Neelix]], {{USS|Voyager}}'s [[chef]] and [[morale officer]], joins her. He hands her the [[requisition report]]s for that week and asks her what she could tell him about the [[Great Wall of China]], who built it and why. Janeway states the obvious, that it was built by the [[Chinese]] to keep people out. When they enter the turbolift, Janeway orders it to [[Bridge|deck one]], while Neelix tells her more facts about the wall and that it was one of the only objects before the [[22nd century]] that could be seen from [[Earth]]'s orbit with the naked eye. Janeway congratulates Neelix on his knowledge about Earth.  When the turbolift arrives at the [[bridge]], Janeway is told by [[Commander]] [[Chakotay]] that they are on course to the [[class Y cluster]] and will arrive in about three days, while she and Neelix walk to her [[Captain's ready room|ready room]]. Janeway asks why Neelix is so interested in the Great Wall of China, and he tells her that he has been studying Earth landmarks. In her ready room, Neelix tells her that he and [[Tom Paris]] have been exchanging cultural knowledge about Earth and [[Talax]] and that Paris has become very knowledgeable about [[Talaxian]] geography. Janeway then asks Neelix what he knows about the [[Millennium Gate]].  Neelix recites the Millennium Gate specifications &ndash; its height, base width, and surface material. He states that it was built in the [[United States of America]] in the [[21st century]]. It is also one of the objects which can be seen from Earth orbit. Janeway tells him that it became a model for the first colonies on [[Mars]] and that one of her ancestors, [[Shannon O'Donnel]], built it, not with hammer and nails, but with words. On family gatherings, Janeway was always told that Shannon O'Donnel was one of the first women astronauts and the driving force behind the Millennium Gate, the first of a long line of Janeway explorers. Neelix asks Janeway to tell him more, so he can impress Tom Paris. He learns that Shannon O'Donnel was in the [[space]] program at the time and that she was asked by the [[governor]] of [[Indiana]], who wanted her expertise about re-cyclic [[life support system]]s. According to Janeway's aunt [[Martha]], Shannon was flown around in a private aircraft.   In the early morning of [[December|December 27]], [[2000]], Shannon O'Donnel drives through the state of Indiana. Her [[automobile#Cars|car]] made a strange bumping noise while she added one of the state's curiosities, the world's largest ball of [[string]], to her [[personal log]], which was a small [[tape recorder]] on the passenger seat. Seeing the Millennium Gate [[billboard]], she headed to [[Portage Creek]], where she hoped that someone could take a look at her car.  === Act One === Driving through the town, she stops to ask a passer-by where she can find [[food]], [[gasoline|gas]], and lodging. The man tells her those things can’t be found any more in Portage Creek. Irritated, Shannon drives off but fails to look ahead and runs into another car. The other driver asks if she has insurance and she tells him it has run out. He says that two hundred dollars would be enough for the damage, but she tells him that she does not have that kind of [[money]]. The other driver accepts his loss and leaves. When Shannon tries to start her car it fails to start.  After Shannon calls a [[tow truck]], she looks around for a place to keep warm while she waits. She finds that [[Alexandria Books]] is the only open store. Once inside, she meets the proprietor and his son, [[Henry Janeway|Henry]] and [[Jason Janeway]], and asks them if she can wait for the tow truck in their store. She tells them she was trying to get to [[Florida]] when her car broke down. She hears Jason joking that Shannon is a [[corporate hit man]] and she grins as she explains to him that she does not do that kind of work anymore. Henry Janeway welcomes her and offers her a cup of [[coffee]].  Shannon observes that most stores in town seemed to be closed. Jason replies that their store will never close. As she noticed their fliers lying on the counter, they tell her that they are fighting the building of the Millennium Gate, ""the world's first self-sustained civic environment"" according to Jason. Henry finds this to be [[propaganda]]; he thinks it is nothing more than a glorified shopping mall. Shannon offers to help distribute the fliers using her [[computer]] if Henry would hire her. But they tell her that they do not need any help. Edging towards the door, Shannon asks again for a job. She says she really needs the money to pay for her car repairs. After an uncomfortable silence, Jason pleads for his father to hire her. Henry reluctantly agrees.   Later that evening, Shannon and Henry visit a local bar and discussed Portage Creek. They talk about the Millennium Gate and why Henry is against it. Shannon learns that Henry would prefer to have lived in the classical age. Shannon prefers the modern age. They sum up the pros and cons of each. They get stuck on the lack of cold [[beer]] in the classical age, whether it may be better with the absence of it. When Henry asks her if she has plans for [[New Year's Eve]] she tells him that it will be no different than last year &ndash; she plans to be asleep. She asks if Henry believes all the noise about the beginning of a new millennium, whether it would cause all those problems like so many said, and if he believes all those hucksters who claimed that [[2001]] was the real millennium and not 2000. As far as Shannon herself is concerned, those years are nothing but numbers on a calendar. Shannon mentions Jason telling her the bookstore has belonged to his family for generations and told Henry that she's just the opposite. She loves to visit places where she has never been before and doesn’t like staying in one place for too long. She found that she was an explorer. Henry grins and tells her he thinks her car looks more like a [[sailing ship]] than a real car. She tells him that it's actually a [[rocket ship]]. Their conversation is interrupted when a rumbling sound shakes their beer glasses. They leave the bar to see what this sound is and see trucks driving by.  === Act Two === The next day Henry Janeway argues with [[Gerald Moss]], who is being interviewed by [[Marci Collins]] of ''[[3 Action News]]''. Henry pleads his case and returns triumphantly when he overhears Moss tell Collins that if Henry's resistance is not resolved, then the Millennium Gate would be built somewhere else. Henry tells Jason and Shannon that all they have to do is to stand firm until New Year's Eve. When Henry and Jason walk into the store Shannon watches Gerald Moss making a phone call. He seems to notice her presence.  That evening Shannon and Henry have a simple meal in the bookstore, which is illuminated by a few lamps and [[candle]]s. Henry pretends they're in [[Paris]]. He places a book about that city alongside the table and tells Shannon he has never left the state of Indiana; he finds himself more comfortable with his books. She asks Henry about her car and he tells her that it has been repaired and is parked behind the garage. Shannon remarks that he should have mentioned that earlier that day. Henry says he forgot. Shannon says she will leave the next day but Henry reminds her that she promised Jason to show him some tricks on her computer. Remembering, Shannon agreed. She thinks he made it difficult for her to say goodbye. During their meal they seem to get along quite well despite their differences. In [[astrometrics]], Captain Janeway is viewing technical data on the Millennium Gate when [[Seven of Nine]] walks in. She asks Seven to help her find more information about the era in which the Millennium Gate had been built, because most of it is lost or damaged. Janeway tells her that the Gate had been built by one of her ancestors over three hundred years earlier. Although Seven finds the Millennium Gate impressive, she questions its relevance to ''Voyager''{{'}}s mission. Janeway tells Seven that it is relevant to her. When Seven replies that she possesses only a fraction of her ancestor's [[DNA]], Janeway tells her that it is not about [[chromosome]]s but about character. Seven asks her to explain and Janeway replies that Shannon O'Donnel inspired her when she was young &ndash; she had a great influence on her imagination and goals, and she was the reason why Janeway joined [[Starfleet]].  Later, Seven is researching historical data in the [[mess hall]] when Tom Paris and Neelix walk in. They are testing each other's knowledge about the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. Paris pours himself a cup of coffee just as Neelix is about to name the seventh wonder, but he cannot remember it. Paris tries to recall it, but he cannot remember what it is either. Their contest is interrupted when Seven of Nine tells them that the seventh wonder was the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]], built by [[Ptolemy II]] in [[1st millennium BC|280 BC]]. Paris sarcastically names [[Borg]] [[photographic memory]] a modern wonder of the world and tells Neelix the knowledge test is a draw and walks away.    Neelix, curious as always, asks Seven what she is doing. Seven tells him about her Shannon O'Donnel project. Neelix offers to help and notices the [[PADD]] containing information about a [[Sven ""Buttercup"" Hansen]], an ancestor of Seven's. The captain had encouraged Seven to research her own genealogy but she questions Buttercup's relevance to Seven's life. As far as she is concerned their name likeness is a coincidence. Neelix tells her that there is some of him in her just as there would be some of Seven in her descendants. Seven replies that this only would be the case if she chose to procreate, and that she cannot appreciate Neelix's joke about a ""Seven of Nine Point Five"" running around. When her [[computer]] can find no references on Shannon O'Donnel, Seven says that her research has failed. Neelix tells her that researching genealogy is a lot like fishing &ndash; she has to use a wider net, and orders the computer to expand its search to non-[[Federation]] [[database]]s, personal archives and photographic indexes. When the computer finishes searching it displays one reference about Shannon O'Donnel.   In the captain's [[quarters]] Neelix and Seven show Janeway what they have found: a picture of Shannon Janeway with her children and grandchildren. Neelix tells her that the photo comes from a [[Ferengi]] database. Eleven years earlier a Ferengi historian collected vast amounts of data about the origin of Federation space travel. The Ferengi wanted to market this information as nostalgic gift items. Janeway says she probably would be his first customer. Seven tells her that they also found journalistic articles about the resistance against the building of the Millennium Gate. Janeway observes that the entire town was against Shannon O'Donnel. She asks Neelix to download the image so she could frame it.  Shannon O'Donnel is watching ''3 Action News'' in the local bar. She is planning her route to Florida where she wanted to visit a cousin of hers, when Gerald Moss walks in. He quotes the slogan her class came up with during her [[NASA]] period. Moss feels sorry for her that she had not made it at NASA and asks if she has stayed in touch with her former classmates. When Shannon tells him she did not, Moss tells her that a classmate of hers made it into to the [[space]] program and is scheduled for four months on the [[International Space Station|space station]] and that he's sorry that she has lost her job. He finds that engineers do not receive the respect they deserve. An annoyed Shannon tells him he had nothing to do with her personal life on which Moss tells her that they always screen their future candidates and makes her a job offer. Shannon could be a consulting engineer on the Millennium Gate project, but the catch is that she has to convince Henry to give up his resistance against it. Moss thinks Henry might listen to her because she seems close to him, Shannon tells him she has to think about his offer whereupon Moss tells her not to wait too long.  === Act Three === The next morning Shannon wakes up from a dream about the first landing on the [[Luna|moon]], which she watched on [[TV]] when she was eleven years old. When she walks into the bookstore she finds Jason playing with her computer. He's enjoying the games but getting vaporized when playing ''[[Matrix of Doom]]'', and she advises him to launch a flare before entering the steel fortress. Shannon is offered a cup of coffee by Jason who tells her his father went out shopping in [[Bloomington]] and that he is in charge of the store for the time being. When Shannon is asked by Jason if she had any children she tells him that she never got around to it and in return asks him where his mother is. Shannon learns his mother died when he was very young and she asks him if he likes working in the bookstore and what his opinion is about the Millennium Gate. Jason thinks the Gate might be pretty cool. When asked by Shannon if he ever saw the first landing on the moon he tells her that he saw it once in his science class.   Just after eleven o'clock Henry Janeway gets back with supplies and Shannon reads the article about him in the local newspaper and gets into an argument with him about the Millennium Gate project. Shannon finds the Gate more than a glorified shopping mall and admits there is a commercial dimension but explains that it is an experimental [[biosphere]]. It is a completely self-sustained city that will help scientists to learn more about the environment so, one day, they can recreate it on other [[planet|worlds]]. Shannon confesses she would like to leave [[Earth]] and its problems one day and tells Henry that the Millennium Gate has a lot of potential. She accuses him of living in the past, of being afraid of the future. Shannon tells Henry that Gerald Moss has offered her a job, at which he accuses her of sleeping with the enemy. Shannon tells him she might be a consulting engineer on the Millennium Gate project; Henry gets angry with her and asks her what would happen if he told her not to accept. Shannon tells him she does not want to live in her car any more. When Henry asks her to stay she tells him she cannot, afraid to get stuck in Portage Creek like Henry is. An angry Henry Janeway helps her pack when Jason walks into the room; Shannon tells him she has to go when Jason asks her why she is leaving.   In Captain Janeway's quarters, she, [[Harry Kim]], Tom Paris, Neelix and Seven of Nine pass their leisure time by exchanging family stories. Kim is telling about his uncle {{dis|Jack|23rd century}}, who commanded a mission to [[Beta Capricus]] in [[2210]], a deep space mission at that time. The journey took six months and his uncle piloted the spacecraft the entire time &ndash; the rest of the crew was in [[stasis]]. When he arrived it turned out that Beta Capricus did not exist, but was indeed just the misinterpreted image of a distant galaxy. Jack did not wake his crew because there was nothing to do or see and returned to [[Earth]]. When they arrived six months later, Jack brought the crew out of stasis and they wondered why they hadn't left Earth's [[orbit]]. The laughter of Kim and his colleagues is interrupted by the door chime; it's [[The Doctor]], who wants to hand the captain a report but who does not want to intrude. When Captain Janeway tells him they were talking about their ancestors, he asks if he might join them. When Janeway agrees, he tells them that he, too, has ancestors. When Tom Paris jokes that his cousin was an electric shaver, he is corrected by The Doctor who tells him he was compiled from the most advanced holomatrices in the Federation; his cousin was an advanced prize-winning [[chess]] program. Seven of Nine tells [[Ensign]] Paris that he has not yet told them about his ancestors. According to Paris there was not much to tell; most of his ancestors were salt of the earth type of people. Some were planetary colonists and others were farmers, and one of his ancestors was a pilot who flew the first orbital glider over the lower Martian plateau. When Neelix mentions that his ancestors might have known Captain Janeway's, he asks for her name, but does not recall Shannon O'Donnel ever mentioned in relation to a Mars mission, and he knows every Mars mission from the [[1970s]] on, and who participated in them, by heart.  === Act Four === Captain Janeway is in her ready room reading a [[newspaper]] article on her computer terminal about [[Henry Janeway]] when Chakotay enters to show her the [[starship|ship]]'s [[status report]]s. She had found some more data from the [[21st century]], but most of it is fragmented and incomplete, so she, jokingly, makes guesses about the contents of Chakotay's report: ""''The [[holographic]] engineer is having problems with her program. Neelix, the [[Cardassian]] cook, is low on supplies. Seven of Twelve is regenerating and Captain Chakotay is doing just fine.''"" She explains that she was wondering how future historians would piece together their lives on ''Voyager''. Smiling, Chakotay replies that it depended on how big the pieces were. Janeway had gone to dozens of history files about 21st century Earth and found that every alien culture saw Earth's history differently. [[Vulcan]]s described [[First Contact]] with a savagely illogical species, Ferengi revered [[Wall Street]] and even viewed it as holy ground, and [[Bolian]]s expressed their dismay about the low quality of [[Human]] plumbing. So she researched the basics &ndash; [[Birth certificate|birth]], [[Death certificate|death]] and [[marriage certificate]]s, court records, housing records, etc. but she found it all incomplete. When Chakotay asks her if Shannon O'Donnel existed, a slightly disappointed Janeway tells him Shannon did exist, but she only trained to be an astronaut and did not work on any of the Mars missions. She was an engineer who worked on the Millennium Gate as a consultant and the Gate itself was welcomed with open arms; there was no opposition except by Henry Janeway. Shannon [[married]] him but did not change history, only her name. Chakotay tells Janeway not to be so hard on her, that Shannon did not know she had to live up to the expectations of Kathryn Janeway. Janeway tries to sound upbeat, saying that the worst part is how she'll break the news to her aunt that the great family legend is false.  Three hours before Moss' deadline, he and Shannon O'Donnel watch ''3 Action News'' in the local bar. Henry Janeway's resistance is still the main news topic. Moss tells Shannon that the building of the Millennium Gate will be delayed if Henry Janeway cannot be persuaded to give up his resistance before midnight. Shannon tells him she has to leave for Florida but Moss tells her he still could use her on the alternate building site of the Millennium Gate in [[Canton]], [[Ohio]]. When Gerald Moss wants to leave the bar, Jason Janeway comes running in and tells Shannon his father still refuses to leave the bookstore and that a crowd is gathering; even the police are present. Shannon tells Jason his father can take care of himself. When Jason pleads her to talk to him she tells him that he won't listen to her, although she likes Henry and Jason Janeway she tells Jason she is sorry, it didn't work out.  At 11:15 pm Shannon drives out of Portage Creek and records her experiences into her personal log. She would not forget the last days and found Henry Janeway an interesting man &ndash; he liked to talk, but refused to listen to anybody but himself. Shannon reminisces about her dinner in Paris with him and found his son Jason as bright as his father. While eating a [[chocolate]] chip cookie, she decides to return to Portage Creek.  When Shannon drove into the street where the bookstore was located, she noticed the police line and walked up to the bookstore, where Gerald Moss told a policeman to let her through. Followed by a ''3 Action News'' camera, Shannon walked to the bookstore entrance.  === Act Five === Shannon knocks on the door and tells Henry to let her in. When she enters the store, she grabs his coat and tells him they're leaving; she even threatens to drag him out of the bookstore if he refuses. Shannon tells him it is over and accuses him of living in the past without any thoughts about the future of his son or Portage Creek. When Henry asks why she has returned, Shannon tells him it was because of the chocolate chip cookies which she bought when she left Portage Creek &ndash; they didn't taste the same without him. Shannon tells him she'd like to stay with him and Jason but she does not want to work in a bookstore for the rest of her life. Shannon tells Henry that he lives in the past while she wants to live in the future, and maybe together they could try to live in the present. She also tells him about the offer Gerald Moss made to her, but that she is prepared to turn him down if Henry wants her to stay. Henry hesitates for a short time and tells her he could re-open his bookstore in the Millennium Gate, whereupon Shannon tells him she probably could get him a nice location in the Gate where nobody would bother him. When Henry asks her if she would ever leave him again she tells him that if she would, they would leave together. When Henry asks the time she tells him it's 11:59. Just before midnight, Shannon and Henry leave Alexandria Books bookstore and Henry closes his store for the last time. As they leave the store they are applauded by the gathered crowd.  Kathryn Janeway is in her quarters staring at the [[star]]s when Neelix contacts her via her [[combadge]]. He asks her to come to the [[mess hall]]; there is no emergency but he wants to speak to her personally.   When Captain Janeway enters the mess hall, she is greeted by her friends who [[toast]] ""[[Ancestors' Eve]]"". When she asks what it's all about, Neelix tells her it's [[April|April 22]], Ancestors' Eve, a holiday he established that very day. Commander Chakotay tells her Neelix had a point: an evening of reflection in honor of those who had come before. Harry tells him that his uncle Jack would approve and [[B'Elanna Torres]] had at least a reason to crawl out from under the [[plasma conduit|warp conduit]] she was working on. Janeway appreciates the gesture, but is interrupted by Tom Paris, who tells Neelix to give her the present. Neelix hands Janeway a framed photo of Shannon O'Donnel and says that he has done some more research and told her the photo was taken around [[2050]] in a park near [[Portage Creek]], thirty-eight years after the dedication of the [[Millennium Gate]]. Neelix thinks a nice place for it would be on the shelf near her desk in her ready room. Janeway thanks him but tells Neelix she is not sure that Shannon O'Donnel belongs there. Seven of Nine tells her she was wrong, Shannon captured her imagination, and historical details are irrelevant. [[Tuvok]] concurs with her analysis and Chakotay tells Janeway that she would not have joined Starfleet if it wasn't for Shannon O'Donnel. The Doctor grabs his [[holo-camera]] and places it on the bar. After he prepares it he tells everyone to gather around the Captain and to face the camera. They share a toast to 'family' as the camera takes its picture.  In the Portage Creek park, Kieran gave his sister ""bunny ears"" after their picture was taken. Shannon tells him to stop it and places him on her lap and pointed towards the camera which brought his attention to it and a big smile upon his face."

With that epiphany in mind, he shows pity for an unlucky gambler and returns $300 to him, much to the dismay of his boss. Upon the loss being reported, a confrontation ensues, ending with Max on the run from the boss' hitman. The chase ends quickly enough and Max is mortally wounded. He limps away into an amusement park and finds himself face-to-face with his son Pip, somehow a boy again. Max is overjoyed and expresses his love for his son and the two relive treasured moments in their past before his son runs off. Max gives chase, not willing to let his formerly estranged son go again so quickly. When he finally catches up to him, Pip reveals that he is approaching death, back in Vietnam, and vanishes. Wanting his son to live, Max makes a deal with God to exchange his fate with Pip's and, with that request granted, Max dies in his son's place. Several years later (after the war), Pip returns to the same fair his father died in, and is alive and with a cane (probably a leg injury). He plays the same shooting game that he and his father used to play together, which reminds him of his father. He will never know that his father had sacrificed his life for him. "
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"  ==Summary== ===Teaser=== :""''Station log, stardate 46925.1. We have been honored with a visit by a delegation of [[Federation]] [[ambassador]]s on a fact-finding mission to [[Bajoran wormhole|the wormhole]]. Fortunately, I have just the officer to take them off my hands.''""  [[Dr.]] [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]] sits in [[Quark's]] with a trio of ambassadors: [[Lojal]], a [[Vulcan]], [[Vadosia]], a [[Bolian]], and [[Taxco]], an [[Arbazan]]. The ambassadors pester him in every way imaginable; he cannot please them no matter how hard he tries. Their conversation is interrupted as the fourth ambassador, [[Lwaxana Troi]], cries out from the [[dabo table]]. Her [[latinum]] [[hair]] [[brooch]] has been stolen. [[Quark]] claims his establishment is not responsible for lost or stolen items, but the [[Betazoid]] seizes his [[lobe]] and demands that everyone in the room be strip-searched until her brooch is found. Fortunately, [[chief of security]] [[Odo]] arrives and, after a few brief questions, glances around the bar and apprehends a [[Dopterian]] pick-pocket who has it. Amazed, Lwaxana asks him how he solved the mystery, and he explains that, since she couldn't sense any guilt in the room, the thief had to be someone immune to [[telepathy]], such as a [[Ferengi]] like Quark. However, as Odo doesn't believe Quark would stoop down to petty theft, he instead focused on a member of the Ferengi species's distant relatives, the Dopterians. As Odo leaves, Lwaxana commands Bashir to tell her ''everything'' he knows about the station's security chief, and it becomes apparent that he has caught the ambassador's eye.  ===Act One=== In [[Operations center|Ops]], [[Chief of Operations|Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]] struggles to force the [[Cardassian]] [[computer]] system to work, as it has a tendency to argue with his suggestions, gives him its opinion, and even on occasions overrules his requests. With the help of [[Anara]], he tries to operate it manually, but continues to have trouble. The problem is so bad, he explains to [[Commander]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]], that he is seriously considering completely overhauling and replacing the computer, a procedure that would take around two to three years to complete. Sisko employs his dry humor, but O'Brien is clearly too frustrated. Sisko allows him to do what he must.   Just then, Bashir and the other three ambassadors arrive in the [[turbolift]], having insisted on seeing Ops. Commander Sisko is forced to make conversation, but saved when a mysterious [[probe]] comes through the [[Bajoran wormhole|wormhole]]. The ambassadors interject a bit during the analysis, as Lojal assumes [[Jadzia Dax|Dax]] is only a young woman without the necessary experience and Vadosia seems intent on being involved in what may be [[first contact]] with a new [[species]]. However, Bashir and Sisko are able to stand them down. Sisko assures them there will be a briefing later.  Meanwhile, Lwaxana finds Odo in the [[security office]] and flirts heavily with him. She is fascinated by the idea of ""being"" with a [[shapeshifter]]. However, the [[constable]] is visibly disquieted by her advances and pretends to have business to which to attend, pretending to hear a com signal and leaves in a hurry.  ===Act Two=== O'Brien and Dax interface with the probe, and the chief finds that the station's computer is cooperating surprisingly well. However, the probe's computer system is unlike anything they've ever seen before. After a while, Anara finds the probe is made out of a type of [[corundium]] [[alloy]] when suddenly the computer says it's completed an analysis much earlier than expected. O'Brien and Dax come over to see that the probe is just a powerful computer &ndash; no communications or science modules, or hint of its origin or mission.   Meanwhile, Odo passes by the group on his way to Sisko's office and complains to the commander about Lwaxana's advances (like a [[Wanoni tracehound]]), but Sisko is unable to help him. He suggests he handle the matter ""delicately."" As he leaves, Lwaxana manages to catch up with Odo despite his attempts to avoid her, saying she's reserved a holosuite with Quark for a [[picnic]]. Saying he's not available and tries to re-enter the turbolift, she follows him headed for one of the upper [[pylon]]s. Intent on having a picnic with him, she says she will send for her [[picnic basket]]. He finally goes on a rant about how different he is, but she ignores it. Before they reach their destination, however, the turbolift stops abruptly as the station's systems begin acting up. Dax attempts to beam them out with the Ops [[transporter]], but something causes it to malfunction. Lwaxana happily says ""alone at last.""  ===Act Three===  Odo cannot shapeshift out due to exposed electric circuits running through the turbolift's positioning mechanisms, so he is forced to put up with Lwaxana while the chief attempts to remedy whatever is going wrong. Odo tells Mrs. Troi that he would prefer to pass the time quietly, however naturally Lwaxana isn't happy with that (while also noting she tends to be attracted to quiet men) and starts telling Odo about [[Ménage à Troi (episode)|the time]] she was held captive on a Ferengi ship along with [[Deanna Troi|her daughter]]. Odo begins to seriously consider risking the exposed circuit&hellip;  In Ops, Bashir begs Commander Sisko to relieve him of his escort duties. Sisko refuses, telling the young officer that he himself had to do the same and in fact [[Curzon Dax|Curzon]] took a perverse pleasure in giving him the unwelcome duty of escorting important guests&hellip; until the day Ben punched one of them for trying to force a young ensign into his quarters. Sisko ends the discussion by warning Bashir not to hit any of them, since he won't be as forgiving as Curzon. Chief O'Brien then tells Sisko that he's having a problem with the computer&hellip; or rather, he isn't. As strange as he admits that it sounds, O'Brien claims the computer seems ''nicer'' somehow, ever since he downloaded the information from the probe. Additionally, every time he leaves Ops, a new problem comes up &ndash; as if the computer wants to keep him busy.  ===Act Four=== :""''Station log, supplemental. Odo and Ambassador Troi remain trapped in turbolift four. As of yet, we have been unable to ascertain what is causing the station's computer to malfunction.''""  Sisko meets with Dax and [[Kira Nerys|Kira]] in Ops and they attempt to come up with an explanation for what is happening. Dax hypothesizes that the information in the probe might be a type of [[sentient]] non-biological [[lifeform]]. O'Brien suggests it's not malevolent, as it's not doing damage, so he suggests uploading the probe's files back to the probe. However, Sisko and Kira realize that it may be time for Odo to regenerate, meaning he will revert to his [[liquid]] state unless they can get him out of the [[turbolift]]. When O'Brien attempts to re-download the information into the probe, the lights go dim and the station shuts down.   In the turbolift, Lwaxana finishes talking about her life and asks Odo if he wants to talk about himself for a while. Although it takes a while for him to open up, Odo starts to tell her about how he began his life being studied by a Bajoran scientist as he learned to become self-sufficient. He then begins to tell the Betazoid that, after that, he tried to fit in by entertaining people at parties, which is why he hates parties so much. Lwaxana tells him that, if he goes to one of hers, she promises everyone will be there to entertain him. Odo finds that, despite his initial reluctance, he is starting to appreciate Mrs. Troi's company. However Odo is also starting to feel pain, as he tries to hold off his need to regenerate.  Meanwhile, O'Brien has come up with a plan to distract the lifeform that has taken over the station; as he slowly tries to cut it off from the station's systems, Sisko, Dax and Anara give the computer increasingly complex commands. The plan seems to be working, but something goes wrong and the system overloads. A fire erupts in one of the [[corridor]]s, where Bashir is escorting the ambassadors to their quarters. They are trapped.  ===Act Five=== Breaking through the doors sealing Bashir and the ambassadors in the corridor will take longer than expected, so Sisko and Kira work on it. In Ops, O'Brien comes up with a plan. Thinking of the lifeform as a puppy, he realizes it thrives on attention and begins to ""build a doghouse,"" although Dax has no idea what he is talking about.  As Odo begins to lose his ability to hold his shape, Lwaxana can see that his is in pain, yet he turns his back toward her and refuses to show his weakness. He tells her that he's not ashamed, it's just a part of himself that he'd rather keep private and no-one (other than the Bajoran scientist) has ever seen him like this. Just then Mrs. Troi holds forward her hair, revealing it to be a [[wig]]. Odo turns around to see Lwaxana with her real black hair tightly pinned up, telling him that no-one has ever seen ''her'' like this. Odo assures her that she looks fine, but Lwaxana tells him she looks 'ordinary', something she's never cared to be and she herself changes who she is. Odo tells Lwaxana that she isn't at all like he expected, and Lwaxana gratefully accepts the compliment and kindly offers to take care of him. Finally trusting Mrs. Troi, Odo transforms into his liquid state and houses himself in a fold in her dress.  Kira and the others continue to try to get into the corridor while O'Brien prepares to set his plan into action. He sets up a special program through which all station commands can be performed, transferring the ""puppy"" into the doghouse. Satisfied to be at the center of the action, the lifeform returns the station to normal.  As a result, Sisko and a team finally manage to enter the corridor where Bashir and the ambassadors were trapped, and the [[fire suppression system]]s begin to work. After being briefly thought dead, Bashir and the ambassadors emerge from a [[conduit]], sooty and disheveled but completely uninjured, with the ambassadors' opinions of Bashir considerably changed, having been quite humbled by the experience. Meanwhile, Odo and Lwaxana finally emerge from the turbolift, shape and wig restored. Odo thanks Lwaxana for her company, telling her that can't have been what she intended for their picnic. Lwaxana assures Odo that all that really matters on a picnic is the company, and promises him they will [[Fascination (episode)|meet again]].  Sisko asks O'Brien how he resolved the situation, and he explains he isolated it into a subprogram (but not sent back to the probe). Surprised he suggests keeping it around, O'Brien assures him it won't bother them and he'll give it attention. Sisko tells him to ""keep it off the furniture."" "
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"  == Summary == ===Teaser=== [[Odo]], [[Kira Nerys|Kira]], [[Doctor]] [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]], [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]], [[Jadzia Dax|Dax]], and [[Worf]] are in a [[holosuite]], enjoying the performance of [[Vic Fontaine]], the doctor's latest [[holoprogram]]. He is singing ""[[You're Nobody 'til Somebody Loves You]]"" and everybody is enjoying themselves. After his performance, he joins the entourage where Bashir introduces him to everyone. Fontaine cracks a few jokes and uses some [[20th century]] jargon that most of the crew don't understand. It turns out that, thanks to {{dis|Felix|24th century}}, he is a self-aware [[hologram]] and a very astute and insightful one on top of that. He is immediately able to tell that Worf and Dax have not been [[married]] for a long time and that O'Brien misses his [[Keiko O'Brien|wife]]. But he stops before saying anything about Kira and Odo, understanding that it is best to not talk about it for the moment. Before they leave, he advises them to dress fancy the next time for the occasion as currently they all look like a ""trapeze act"".   After the group leaves the holosuite and go into [[Quark's]], they continue on about how impressed they are with the program and Fontaine in particular. Bashir suggests meeting up again the next evening to hit the [[casino]]s and play a little [[blackjack]] and [[roulette]] after Vic's performance. Dax is rather enthused about going back again while her husband Worf tells her that he still prefers [[Klingon opera]] and Kira says that she is leaving for [[Bajor]] in the morning. Dax slips and tells her to say hi to [[Shakaar Edon]] for her, before realizing that she might have said too much. Odo becomes somewhat irritated when he hears what Kira is up to. After she leaves, Bashir carries on about Fontaine, telling O'Brien that if it wasn't for his pointers, he would not be dating [[Ensign]] {{dis|Walker|Ensign}} now. He says that Fontaine knows quite a lot about life, love and women, the three things &ndash; O'Brien jokes &ndash; Bashir apparently knows nothing about. Odo, who is standing right there, hears all of this and is suddenly intrigued.  ===Act One=== The next day, the [[constable]] is having a conversation with [[Quark]] in his office. Quark tells him that it's been [[Children of Time (episode)|over a year]] since Kira broke up with Shakaar and that in all this time, Odo has done nothing about it. Odo says that it is not that simple, but for Quark it is quite simple: Odo had plenty of opportunities and he let them all slip away. When Odo dismisses Quark's advice, Quark tells him that Odo is in fact not a very lovable person, as he is cold, rigid and remote. Before he leaves, however, Odo comes around and asks him for a favor: access to Dr. Bashir's new holosuite program.   The constable returns to the holosuite to talk to Vic about his situation with [[Major]] Kira. Vic states his accurate assessment that Odo loves Kira but she considers him a friend. Vic adds that women have been known to change their minds and that it is really not that hard to get through to them, especially if they already like you. Odo says that Kira is aware of his feelings for her but that she prefers another man with great charisma. Vic replies that it is not the other man he has to worry about but himself. He asks him to lose his frozen-solid appearance and to allow those feelings he has inside of him to bubble to the surface. He tells him that if he wants to win the girl, they have to thaw him up a little bit and that it was time they had some fun &ndash; a concept which is quite unknown to Odo and which Vic points out is precisely the problem. So a long learning process begins for Odo. He immediately changes into a [[tuxedo]] and Vic puts him behind a [[piano]] and together they perform a [[Come Fly with Me|song]] that exhilarates Odo. Vic's goal is to have the Constable become less shy and more socially at ease every day so that in the end he can win over his heart's desire.  ===Act Two===  After the show, Odo and Vic are in Vic's apartment, discussing Odo's experience on stage. Odo is visibly relaxed, until he admits to Vic that he is grateful that his friends did not witness the act. Vic advises Odo to take deep breaths right there to simply relax. Odo is skeptical, but tries it. He is just beginning to enjoy this when there is a knock on the door. Vic has invited two women to his apartment to interact with Odo. One of the women named [[Melissa]] admires Odo's ""artistic hands"" and speaks with him about music, having seen the piano act at the club. Odo is uncomfortable with all the attention, especially when Melissa starts hitting on him. Vic sees his discomfort, and invites the women and Odo to a restaurant at [[the Dunes]]. Odo declines the invitation, being more interested in Major Kira than the holosuite woman, but Vic convinces him that he needs to practice with other women in order to pursue Major Kira. They go off for the night.  Later, Odo makes a report to [[Captain]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]]. Interestingly, while he reads the report, he hears his [[chief of security]] humming a song in his office, a change he is happy to see. Sisko joins along in singing with Odo and snaps his fingers to the tune. Odo stops when he realizes that, unaware he was singing out loud. Meanwhile, traveling to [[Operations center|Ops]] together in a [[turbolift]], Bashir and Dax are talking about Kira's visit. She lengthened her stay on [[Bajor]] with Shakaar, which makes them grow curious about the state of her relationship with the [[First Minister]]. Dax mentions Odo isn't doing anything about it, which is part of the problem.  During another lesson in the holosuite, Odo is at the piano when Vic announces a special guest, [[Lola Chrystal]]. She, however, has Kira's likeness. Odo, a little stunned, watches Chrystal as she sings the next tune while spending time close to him on the piano.   ===Act Three=== Vic invites Chrystal to the hotel room with Odo, celebrating with a drink and then leaves them alone. Odo plays along with the situation for a bit, expressing his feelings for Kira, but then stops and has a little confrontation with Vic about it. He's convinced that he will never be able act normally, knowing she is not the real Kira. Vic promises Odo that he will work on the hologram's personality, but Odo is done.   Later, Kira's back on the station. She catches up with Odo on the [[Promenade]] but, not ready yet to have a long hello, he is politely short with her, to her confusion. However, without Odo's knowledge, Vic goes to Kira while she's meditating in a holosuite, having transferred his matrix from another holosuite. He invites Kira to a date in the holosuite on the constable's behalf. She's annoyed that he interrupted her, and says Odo should have asked her, but Vic is persistent and Kira agrees.  ===Act Four=== While Odo is in his office, Vic contacts him to get him to the holosuite, promising a more realistic Kira program. Again, he's very persistent. During dinner, Odo is really at ease with the Major, daring to show her his real personality since he believes she is merely a hologram. He admits that in the past, he has let his work be an excuse for not living his life, to which Kira understands. The music starts and Odo suggests to dance, even insisting when Kira says she's not sure how. As the two gaze into each others eyes, Kira suddenly sees Odo in a whole new light and suggests a second date outside of the holosuite. Odo tells Kira that she can't leave the holosuite since she's just a hologram, but Kira refutes this and Vic admits that Odo has actually spent the evening with the actual Kira. Both are furious with Vic for the deception, and the walls instantly go up for an embarrassed Odo as he quickly excuses himself and leaves the holosuite. As Kira turns to face Vic, he realises the night is over and shuts down the program himself.   ===Act Five=== On the next day, Vic contacts Odo again to apologise, insistent that it was time to talk to Kira for real and and that the night was worthwhile. Embarrassed, Odo says he can't imagine what Kira thinks of him now, and shuts off the communication. Meanwhile, Kira is distracted as she thinks about the previous evening and asks Dax if she's ever experienced a moment of true clarity. Dax admits she has twice, but that's across all seven of her lifetimes and warns Kira that true clarity is rare and fleeting; it must be acted on straight away before confusion and doubt can begin to cloud it. At this moment, Kira sees Odo emerge from his office and experiences another moment of clarity. This time, she decides to act on it immediately.   Kira approaches Odo, more distant and cold than ever and determined to forget the previous evening, but Kira demands the chance to talk about what happened but over dinner (insisting they go anywhere but a holosuite). Odo asks about her relationship with Shakaar, and Kira insists there is no relationship; her visit was purely to update him on the [[Dominion War|war]] and the two are nothing more than friends. The conversation seems increasingly angry to everyone around as Kira asks again about dinner, Odo sarcastically asks what will happen afterward, and Kira suggests dancing. Odo goes for broke and suggests Kira might expect him to kiss her after a date, and Kira replies that perhaps she would. Odo then wonders aloud why they don't dispense with the pleasantries and kiss right there, to which Kira doesn't object. Suddenly, Odo grabs her and they have a first [[kiss]] right there and then bringing the [[Promenade]] to a standstill as everyone, including Dax, Quark, and Morn watch on in pleasant surprise. The two continue, despite the onlookers.   Following this incident, Odo goes back in the holosuite to thank Vic about all the things he has done, even if some looked like mistakes at first. Before leaving, Vic asks Odo to leave the program running for a few minutes, as he feels like singing. Vic gets up on stage and sings ""Come Fly with Me"" and Odo snaps his fingers while he exits the holosuite. "
0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0," ==Plot==  Since his arrival in the future, Fry has been living in the [[Planet Express]] offices, and due to this, [[Hermes Conrad|Hermes]] arranges an immediate agenda meeting regarding their workplace's conditions: his habits of eating everything, attracting owls with crumbs, using the emergency chemical burns shower irresponsibly and drying his hair with the [[Planet Express Ship|ship]]'s engines, giving him huge doses of radiation at the cost of throwing off the calibration of their output, making it known that Fry's presence is disrupting business. When the group comes to talk with [[Professor Farnsworth|Hubert J. Farnsworth]] about Fry's living arrangements, the last straw is cut when Fry eats the Professor's alien mummy of Emperor Nimbala - who is noted to taste like beef jerky - and is utterly upset, as it was he who was going to eat it. Due to the events of this morning, it is decided that Fry has to go. After being physically removed from the office, Fry decides to move in with Bender.  Several days later, Fry decides that he can't take living in Bender's 2 cubic meter [[Apartment 00100100|apartment]], and the two begin a search for a living space that will satisfy them both. But ultimately, they are unsuccessful until one of Professor Farnsworth's colleagues dies. Fry and Bender lease his old apartment, with Bender living in the closet.   At the housewarming party - [[Turanga Leela|Leela]] gives Fry a mini fruit tree, [[John A. Zoidberg|Doctor Zoidberg]] brings caviar and Professor Farnsworth gives him a teriyaki-style mummy - they watch [[All My Circuits]], and each time Bender is in the room, the television doesn't work. Bender gets the landlady ([[Hattie McDoogal]]), and after four failed attempts to find the cause, she finally finds the cause: Bender's antenna.  After discovering that his antenna interferes with the building's televisions, Bender is forced to relocate back to his old residence, but Fry stays put. Distraught at the separation from his friend, Bender goes on a self-destructive sobriety binge, eventually cutting off his own antenna to live with Fry.  Out of concern for Bender, Fry moves back into Bender's old apartment (after [[Smitty]] recovers Bender's antenna). Fry then discovers that Bender's over-sized closet (bigger than a human-sized bedroom) has more than enough room for a human to live comfortably.  "
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0," == Summary == === Teaser === At [[red alert]], the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701}} detects an approaching [[spread pattern|spread]] of primitive, [[chemical fuel]]ed, [[sublight]] [[nuclear missile]]s, which are quickly destroyed by its [[phaser]]s. The crew traces the origin of the missile's path. [[Captain]] [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]] orders [[Ensign]] [[Pavel Chekov|Chekov]] to plot a course, for the ''Enterprise'' to proceed, at [[warp]] factor 3 to the launchers. Meanwhile, during [[Dr.]] [[Leonard McCoy|McCoy]]'s routine health check, a rare terminal illness, [[xenopolycythemia]], is discovered. They do not know its cure. It will kill him within a year. McCoy insists that he can remain in his post on the ''Enterprise'', but Kirk immediately informs [[Starfleet]] and requests a replacement.  === Act One === The ''Enterprise'' arrives at the location of the missile launch, where they see an [[asteroid]], two hundred miles in diameter. Oddly, it is not in any [[orbit]] but follows an independent course through the local [[star system]]. Its course, 241-mark-17, leads it in 396 days, to the planet [[Daran V]], where it will collide and kill its population of 3.724 billion. Before destroying the asteroid, to prevent the collision, they scan it and learn it is an atomic-powered spaceship. They do not detect living beings. [[Spock]] guesses that the passengers are dead. The ''Enterprise'' charts a course parallel to it.   Kirk and Spock enter the [[transporter room]], and prepare to beam onto the asteroid/spaceship. McCoy insists on joining them so the arrive inside the asteroid. They find a surface that appears geologically active, with a reddish sky, and are puzzled that the builders apparently wanted the inside of the ship to look just like the surface of a planet. The surface has large orange cylinders, from which primitive, sword-bearing men emerge. Their leader is a beautiful woman. After a brief melee, Kirk, McCoy and Spock get captured. McCoy shares a meaningful look with the leader, before he is knocked unconscious.   The beautiful woman introduces herself as [[Natira]], the high priestess and leader of her people. Natira ""welcomes"" the officers to their world ''[[Yonada]]''. The three are taken below the surface, where they encounter a large population of young and apparently healthy people. Natira leads the three into an [[Oracle]] Room, where she consults an unseen authoritative entity manifested by a decorative altar and a booming voice. Kirk and McCoy estimate that after ten thousand years in this multi-generational ship, the people no longer realize they are inside a spaceship. The Oracle ""punishes"" Kirk, Spock, and McCoy by shocking them with an energy beam, rendering them unconscious.  === Act Two === The three regain consciousness, although McCoy remains out longer due to his illness, in some sort of guest area. Kirk then informs Spock about McCoy's condition. An old man enters the room and gives them an [[herb]] derivative to counteract the effects of the Oracle's attack, noting that many people on the ship have been punished in this way. When they tell him they are not from ''Yonada'', he recalls how he once climbed the mountains, ""even though it is forbidden,"" and found that the world of ''Yonada'' is not a planet at all. ""''For the world is hollow and I have touched the sky&hellip;''"", he says, before collapsing and dying &ndash; apparently from a red, glowing subcutaneous control device in his temple. Natira comes in, has the old man's body gently taken away, and seems to take a special interest in McCoy. Kirk recommends that McCoy use this to their advantage so that they may learn more about the civilization. The captain is faced with a triple dilemma: either risk violating the [[Prime Directive]] by informing the people of ''Yonada'' of their situation, destroy the asteroid with them in it, or allow it to destroy Daran V. Natira admits she is in love with McCoy and wants him to stay on ''Yonada'' as her mate. She speaks of a final destination that is rich and green and notes that the Oracle has promised they shall reach it ""soon."" When McCoy tells her he has only a year to live, she tells him even a day, a month, or a year with him will make her happy.   Spock and Kirk make their way to the Oracle Room, and Spock recognizes the writing as that of the [[Fabrini]], a civilization wiped out ten thousand years prior, when their [[star]] went [[supernova|nova]]. He also sees a symbolic map of the Fabrina solar system. Prior to dying out, the Fabrini had lived underground to protect themselves. They had also built this spaceship ''Yonada'' and programmed the Oracle of the People, which is actually a powerful computer, to take their surviving civilization to another habitable [[planet]]. The people of Yonada are their descendants. Spock manages to open the door, and the two conceal themselves in the temple behind a monolith as Natira enters. She asks the Oracle for permission to marry McCoy. The Oracle grants it, so long as McCoy agrees to join the Fabrini and submit to the instrument of obedience to become one of their people. As she's leaving, however, the Oracle discovers Kirk and Spock and zaps them. They are arrested and sentenced to death.  === Act Three === McCoy agrees to stay on ''Yonada'', but begs that Kirk and Spock be released. McCoy tells her he could never be happy on ''Yonada'' knowing that his two friends had died for his happiness. Natira agrees. As Kirk and Spock prepare to return, McCoy insists on staying. Kirk and McCoy briefly argue about his decision, but Kirk agrees to leave him behind; he and Spock then return to the ''Enterprise''. In a ritual with the Oracle, McCoy has the instrument of obedience implanted in his head and he and Natira are married. At the Oracle's command, she reveals to him an ancient book that is to be opened and read when the ship reaches the ""New World of the Promise."" Meanwhile, Kirk consults with [[Admiral]] [[Westervliet]] on a [[desktop monitor|video screen]] in his [[quarters]], who relieves him of all responsibility for the ''Yonada'', saying that [[Starfleet Command]] will handle the situation. McCoy calls the ship with his [[communicator]] and tries to explain that by consulting the book Spock can change the ''Yonada''{{'}}s course. His instrument of obedience immediately sends him a shock of pain, and he passes out as Natira enters. MoCoy's instrument of obedience glows red, like that of the old man&hellip;  ===Act Four === Kirk and Spock beam back to the ''Yonada'' and Spock removes McCoy's instrument of obedience, shocking Natira. She tries to call for the guards, but Kirk subdues her and persuades her to give them a chance. He explains the history of the Fabrini and ''Yonada''. She is very skeptical of the story and the Oracle begins to torment her through her instrument. She flees, but does not turn Kirk and Spock over to the guards. Kirk and Spock have found that a faulty part of the Oracle computer has caused a change in course. Natira consults the Oracle, which knocks her out. When Kirk, Spock, and McCoy arrive, she says she believes them and McCoy removes her instrument. Kirk and Spock move to take the book out of the temple, but the Oracle fights them, kicking up a storm and increasing the temperature in the room to 120 degrees, planning to burn them to [[death]] or until they die of heat stroke. McCoy shows them how to open the pylon containing the book and Spock uses the book to disable the heating element, as well as the Oracle, and reprogram the spaceship's course.   McCoy and Natira share a tearful farewell: She must stay to lead her people to the promised land and McCoy is determined to keep traveling the universe in search of a cure for his disease as well as for others afflicted. After correcting the ''Yonada''{{'}}s course, Spock shows Kirk the cylinders containing the vast database of the Fabrini, which contains medical knowledge, including the cure for xenopolycythemia. McCoy undergoes the very painful treatment for his illness, with [[Nurse]] [[Christine Chapel|Chapel]] at his side in the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s [[sickbay]]. When McCoy emerges cured, Kirk promises him the ''Enterprise'' will soon return to the area in 390 days when the ''Yonada'' eventually reaches its correct destination. McCoy is pleased by Kirk's promise and the ''Enterprise'' leaves ''Yonada''.  "

==Plot==
When [[Lord Nibbler|Nibbler]] has his 5th birthday party, [[Bender Bending Rodríguez|Bender]] becomes annoyed that Nibbler is getting more attention than him. Having reluctantly made a birthday cake for Nibbler, Bender is aghast to see Nibbler gobble it all up before everybody else can praise Bender for the cake. In extreme annoyance, Bender flushes Nibbler down the toilet. [[Turanga Leela|Leela]] is distraught at the loss of her pet and angered by Bender's inability to understand the emotions of others. [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] proposes a solution: installing an empathy chip in Bender's head that will cause him to feel other people's emotions. After forcibly installing the chip, the chip is tuned to pick up Leela's emotions, so that whatever feelings Leela experiences, Bender is forced to experience as well.

After a night of experiencing Leela's feelings, Bender misses Nibbler so much that he cannot stand it. When [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] tells him that alligators can supposedly live after being flushed, Bender flushes himself down the toilet in pursuit of Nibbler. Fry and Leela enter the sewers and quickly manage to find Bender. Unfortunately, they also find a crowd of mutants who live in the sewers. (Among them, Leela's mother, Turanga Munda, as by this point David X. Cohen and Matt Groening had planned her future) The mutants introduce them to their subterranean civilization. They also reveal that a monster called [[El Chupanibre]] has been terrorizing them.

Leela, thinking that Nibbler is the monster, is happy until she is informed that the only way to lure the monster out is to offer a sacrifice in the form of a virgin. Although not one herself (owing to the events of [[Love's Labors Lost in Space|an earlier episode]]), Leela is the closest thing to a virgin there and is therefore forced to be the sacrifice. At the sacrifice, Nibbler emerges from a pipe - but so does a large, reptilian monster, who is the real El Chupanibre. Fry gets entangled in the trap that was meant for El Chupanibre, leaving only Bender to fight the beast. However, Leela is so scared, for herself and the others, that Bender is immobilized by her emotions. He and Fry teach Leela to stop caring about other people and care only about herself, and as a result, Bender is able to fight off the beast, whom he eventually flushes down a giant toilet into the [[Sub-sewer|sub-sewers]].


The Professor removes Bender's empathy chip. He says in amazement that the chip was actually turned off, so that Bender was actually sympathizing for Leela by himself. He then corrects himself, saying that it was actually at triple capacity (""And I still barely felt anything!"" Bender claims.) Bender still retains his 'in-your-face' attitude; meanwhile, Leela learns that adopting Bender's attitude is better than being nice.

== Synopsis ==
On the day she scores her dream promotion, a hard-working woman starts to realize her entire existence may be one large dreamlike state.

== Plot ==
=== Act I ===
Hotel hospitality employee Michelle Weaver speaks with her boss Reggie regarding promotion to manager. She states her qualifications which bore him, so she tells a joke about a clerk willing to help her boss and an angry old man looking to buy half a head of lettuce. Reggie laughs and gives her the job, saying he's never seen anybody more dedicated. He tells her ""you really picked the right life."" A handful of hotel employees outside the room congratulate her.

Down in the hotel lobby, Michelle is seen earning the respect of both her employees and customers alike. One angry couple - the Desmonds - are particularly rude to the concierge, so she steps in and upgrades their room at no charge. She goes on break and calls her husband Carl who also is very happy for her. Suddenly Michelle goes into a brief shock. She looks around and sees everyone around her go into a trance; she follows them outside and sees a giant red orb in the sky looking down at the world. It emits an ear-piercing noise, then everyone looks up and stares into it with eerie jaw-dropping expressions. An older woman walks up to Michelle and asks if she knows how long ''downtime'' will be; confused, Michelle runs off as the woman looks into the orb and drops her jaw.  

=== Act II ===
A panicked Michelle runs down the street and asks an unaffected cop what is happening. He tells her it's ""scheduled maintenance"" and that they need to ""wake up"" before staring up into the orb himself. Michelle runs all the way home to find Carl unaffected; however, when she tells him about the orb, he spontaneously breaks into an Irish accent and also rambles about ''downtime. ''He asks if Michelle remembers who she was before she was Michelle, but she has no idea what he's talking about. Carl says he will ""contact them... to send some help"", then walks outside and succumbs to the orb.

Two young skateboarders then break into Michelle’s house saying they're from ""customer service"". Michelle pulls a knife on them despite their insistence they’re here to help. The knife suddenly disappears out of her hand; the skateboarders play her a video for SleepAway, a digital program for ""identity tourism"". As a person dreams, a machine hooked to the side of their head digitally places them in an avatar capable of living out any fantasy they want with the only rule being ""Don't Break Character"". Michelle has a very hard time believing this, but the skateboarders confirm she is a character being controlled by S Phineas Lowell. They explain he has been controlling her choices and the path she has taken, but that Phineas had a heart attack (the shock Michelle felt earlier) during his last game session and has been placed in a coma — leaving his consciousness still synced to Michelle. The skateboarders want to force an un-sync in order to save what's left of Phineas's mind, but Michelle panics over what this will do to her. 

Michelle refuses to believe anything except her own reality and wishes to wait things out until the downtime is over. The skateboarders then bring Phineas's wife Ellen into the house. She stops the skateboarders from the forced un-sync — claiming they don’t know how the game really works — and asks to talk to Michelle alone.

A voice from the orb announces the maintenance will finish in 20 minutes. As they walk outside, Ellen compliments Michelle for being a strong and beautiful person; she understands why Phineas chose her as his avatar. Ellen talks about the first time she met Phineas — at an antique shop where she accidentally cracked a lamp and he whispered to her ""Don't break it."" Phineas repeated the phrase when he proposed to Ellen 5 years later, this time pointing to his heart. Ellen reiterates that if Michelle doesn't wake up, there will be no other way to save Phineas's mind. Michelle starts to feel like he’s known Ellen her whole life. Ellen sporadically kisses Michelle, then asks her to try to wake up with her. They both look up to the orb, but Michelle — still not convinced of her true identity – backs down at the last second. The orb watches her as she runs off. 

=== Act III ===
The skateboarders cruise the streets looking for Michelle, who briefly hides among the stiff people standing in the streets before returning to the hotel. She grabs the penthouse key and heads up to find the Desmonds in their trance staring out the windows. Michelle knocks Mr. Desmond over then lies down. A pigeon flies up to her window and upon seeing her, lets out the ear-piercing screech from earlier. This leads the skateboarders to the hotel as the orb announces maintenance will end in 5 minutes.

Michelle takes the skateboarders on a wild goose chase through the hotel before eventually ending up on the roof. As the clock ticks down, a window washer named Tom approaches her and says he is ""Escalated Customer Service"". He apologizes for the inconvenience and says he called the skateboarders off, claiming they were just trying to help fix the ""error"". He explains the game world has been experiencing many recent issues such as a section where people entered into a laundromat and exited through a manhole. He then talks about Michelle’s situation, saying that Phineas is welcome to stay in the game and continue playing as Michelle so long as she signs a waiver relieving Sleepaway from any liability. Michelle doesn't want to stay in this world now that she knows it's fake, but Tom tells her to forget about Phineas. He reveals Phineas took sleeping pills before logging into the game and was taken off life support 45 minutes ago — meaning there is nothing for Phineas to wake up to. She reluctantly signs the waiver.

Downtime ends, and the orb disappears. The people snap out of their trances and continue on with whatever they were doing before. Michelle is seen back at work enjoying her normal life as a hotel manager. Ellen walks into the lobby and asks to book a room for a few weeks. Michelle smiles at her.

== Summary ==
=== Teaser ===
[[Jadzia Dax]] and [[Miles O'Brien]] tell [[Benjamin Sisko]] in his office about finding the [[personnel file]]s kept by [[Dukat]], the previous [[prefect]] of [[Deep Space 9]]. O'Brien tells Sisko he should probably warn [[Kira Nerys]] about her file before she can see it. Kira walks in at that moment and asks what should she be warned about; Sisko tells Kira she might find her file disappointing, and Kira assures him she can handle it, and begins to review her file. Moments later, Kira storms out of the room, angry and insulted at how little emphasis she got as a member of the Bajoran resistance. In the meantime, [[Julian Bashir]] tells Sisko that [[Kai]] [[Opaka]], who has never left [[Bajor]] before, is aboard for an unannounced visit and wishes to have the tour of the station that previously Sisko offered her. 

As they show her around the station, Opaka seems unusually distracted, which is noticed by Bashir. Sisko then notices Opaka standing by the viewport where the [[Bajoran wormhole|wormhole]] can be best seen. It's obvious she would like to see the wormhole, but doesn't say it. Since there's nothing scheduled to go through that day, Sisko decides to take her himself on a [[runabout]] accompanied by Kira, and he also allows Bashir to tag along. [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]] prepares the {{USS|Yangtzee Kiang}}, though, interestingly, as they board Opaka pauses to give O'Brien a [[necklace]] she was wearing and asks him to give it to [[Molly O'Brien|his daughter]] for her. He sees them off, a bit puzzled.

=== Act One ===
Sisko takes the ''Yangtzee Kiang'' through the wormhole, and Opaka is amazed and emotionally moved by the spectacle of the interior. Sisko remarks that she'll see in a few years just what it is worth to Bajor, and is ready to head back. Opaka, who is seemingly waiting for something, is disappointed until they pick up a narrow band [[subspace]] signal and insists they investigate it before leaving the [[Gamma Quadrant]]. They identify the source as a [[planet]] orbited by [[artificial satellite]]s, one malfunctioning. Bashir identifies a habitable [[moon]] with possible [[lifeform]]s when suddenly one of the satellites comes near the runabout and fires. The runabout is badly damaged and starts to descend towards the moon, and while the officers fight for control Opaka is not fearful but strangely content as the ship [[crash landing|crash lands]].

On the planet's surface, Sisko, Bashir, and Kira leave the runabout, carrying out the unconscious Kai. Unfortunately, Bashir soon pronounces her dead, and Kira mourns. As they stand by the runabout, they realize they are not alone.

=== Act Two ===

Meanwhile, on DS9, the ''Yangtzee Kiang'' is now three and a half hours overdue. O'Brien and Dax prepare the {{USS|Rio Grande}} to find the missing crew. Odo must handle the frequent messages from Bajor on the Kai's status, as they were informed she went into the wormhole. He can only tell them they have a lead on where they are at the moment. Dax asks Odo to have the Bajorans have a vessel on the Gamma Quadrant side of the wormhole to relay messages via subspace.

On the planet, the crew is taken by the [[Ennis]], a [[humanoid]] species, and they escort them into the [[cave]]s with weapons in hand. They are obviously cautious of them. The apparent leader, [[Golin Shel-la]], is suspicious, but Sisko is able to convince him they are not hostile. He permits Bashir to help Kira with her wounds. He explains that they live along with their enemies the [[Nol-Ennis]] on the moon, which serves as a [[penal colony]] to which both groups were banished after their homeworld's mediators were unable to negotiate peace between the two factions. Now that the [[Starfleet]] crew is with them, they will be considered their allies and in danger, even though a rescue team is probably on the way. 

The Nol-Ennis suddenly attack the area and the prisoners immediately start the firefight. Several soldiers are killed from each faction before Kira puts an end to the skirmish by bringing down part of the cave ceiling with a Starfleet [[phaser]], despite Sisko's desire not to get involved. Just then, the silhouette of the Kai unexpectedly appears in the cave entrance. She is alive.

=== Act Three ===
Bashir examines the Kai, who appears normal and healthy. She says she only remembers the crash, but then nothing. She gets up and walks to see the area. Bashir further says her physiology is radically different, with an inexplicable [[biomechanical engineering|biomechanical]] presence in her cells. He needs to do a full analysis to see what's going on. Interestingly, the other fallen soldiers similarly begin to revive. 

Fortunately, O'Brien and Dax are able to trace the ''Yangtzee Kiang''{{'}}s [[warp eddy]] current to the system, and head there, though it is uncharted. O'Brien is confused that they aren't even picking up the ship's [[transponder]] signal, which will make the search difficult. 

Bashir sees that the same phenomenon in Opaka is the same in these prisoners. Somehow, the transformation has kept them from dying. Shel-la admits that he has ""died"" many times before. Bashir wants to get the runabout's [[computer]] working to figure this out, but Sisko says it's too dangerous. Shel-la wants the answer himself, so he guarantees his protection and Bashir leaves with two of his men. Opaka questions Shel-la on why the war started, but it's clear they don't care, they still want vengeance. It appears that they were sent to the moon as an example for the rest of the population on what happens when two sides can't come to a peace. The whole moon was designed to prolong their suffering. Kira, needing a defensible area, questions Shel-la about the Ennis' lack of defenses. He responds that since both sides have realized that they cannot die, their tactics have changed. Sisko suggests that a Starfleet rescue team might be able to transport both of the factions to different planets, where they could live separately instead of continuing their endless fight. He challenges him to talk to the other leader to get a truce in the meantime.

=== Act Four ===
In the meantime, O'Brien and Dax find that they can't trust their sensors due to [[delta radiation]]. They'll need to search one planet at a time, but O'Brien comes up with a design for a [[differential magnetometer]] which, fitted onto a probe, should detect the particular [[magnetic]] resonance traces in the ''Yangtzee Kiang''{{'}}s hull. This should speed up the search, though Dax is skeptical. Eventually, it works and they are headed to the moon.

The Ennis and the Nol-Ennis agree to meet at a neutral site near the runabout. Sisko leaves with them, but Kira stays behind with Opaka. When they leave, she starts a conversation with Kira about her possibly seeing herself in these hardened people, having fought for so long and delivered so much violence. Kira initially doesn't see the parallels, but Opaka detects the guilt Kira feels for the violence she committed during the [[Occupation of Bajor]]. She says Kira must accept the violence within her in order to overcome the guilt, and comforts her. Kira admits she is afraid the [[Prophet]]s won't forgive her for what she has done, but Opaka says they are simply waiting for her to forgive herself.

Bashir returns to the runabout, protected by the Ennis, to repair the computers so that he can investigate the [[artificial microbe]]s, or [[nanite]]s, further. He is successful and starts the computer to analyze the data. Soon, Sisko and the Ennis arrive. The Nol-Ennis leader, [[Zlangco]], steps up to them and Sisko explains the deal. Unfortunately, neither side takes the negotiations seriously and the fighting breaks out again, with the Starfleet crew caught in the middle of it. Bashir pushes Sisko out of the way of a weapon that was coming towards him, saying that they can't afford to die on the moon, not even once.

=== Act Five ===
Dax finds [[Human]] life signs on the moon, but O'Brien, upon seeing the satellite system, realizes that it must be using a [[dampening field]] to block the ''Yangtzee Kiang''{{'}}s transponder signal, the reason he wasn't detecting it before. They retreat to a safe distance and he works on getting a communication through.

Bashir explains to Sisko that the biomechanical devices that bring the Ennis and the Nol-Ennis back to life cannot survive in any other environment besides that of the moon. Furthermore, once a person has died with them, the body becomes dependent on them, meaning none of the Ennis or Nol-Ennis, nor Kai Opaka, can ever leave again. O'Brien then cuts in to signal Sisko, and lets him know he's working on a plan for transport. The satellites are going to make it difficult.

Sisko goes to inform Opaka of her fate, however, before he gets to it, Opaka declares she is staying. With a moment of clarity, she believes that she has found the answers to her own prophecies. She says that, even as they came through the wormhole, she sensed that she would not return. She asks Kira to tell the others that she has answered the call of the Prophets, and that she was brought there because it is time for the people on the planet to begin their healing process, just as Kira was brought there to begin hers. 

O'Brien manages to find a way to beam the marooned crew away by distracting one of the satellites with a probe thereby creating a hole in the defense grid established by the satellites. Informing Sisko, they start on it. Meanwhile, Bashir suggests finding a way to reprogram the microbes so that they would stop functioning after death, allowing the inhabitants to die for good and end their torture. However, when Shel-la expresses his intent to use it in order to defeat the Nol-Ennis for good, Bashir disappointingly abandons the idea. Fighting erupts outside and Shel-la is reluctantly drawn away. Sisko begins to tell the Kai that if they ever find a way to get her off the planet without killing her then they'll return, but Opaka interrupts him and tells him that her work is now on the moon. However, her and Sisko's ''[[pagh]]'' will cross again. The crew are beamed up, leaving the warring Ennis and Nol-Ennis behind, and the Kai with a lot of work to do.

The center representative, Mr. Vance, tells them that 98% of couples have been happy with the quality of the swap, but the company offers a return clause if they change their mind afterwards, as the swap procedure can be reversed. The couple decides to trade their aged bodies in for younger models. To their dismay, the swap will cost $10,000 for both, and they have only half that amount. The old man attempts to earn the rest of the money in a high-stakes poker game. The soft-hearted dealer, seeing the old man put all his money on one hand, secretly folds his winning hand to allow Holt to leave with the same amount he started with. Finally, Mr. Holt has himself changed, intending to use his young body to earn the money for his wife's change. In the end, they realize they can't wait the necessary time for the young Mr. Holt to earn the money for Mrs. Holt's procedure and would rather be old together than for one of them to be young and the other old. He opts for the return clause. His ""old"" body restored, Mr. and Mrs. Holt depart towards an uncertain future--but their love for each other is ""younger"" than ever.  "

[[Captain]] [[Kathryn Janeway]] talks with a [[Mikhal Traveler]], who is later revealed to be called [[Nakahn]]. They're in his lodge at the Mikhal [[outpost]] and he's animatedly telling the captain the incredible story of one of his travels, involving a monstrous, living [[asteroid]]. [[Kes]] comes in with [[Zahir]], the Mikhal pilot with whom she's been working on the transfer of medical supplies to the outpost. Zahir picks up the last part of Nakahn's story and it's immediately obvious that he's skeptical of it. When he makes that clear, tempers flare and there's a short argument between the two Mikhal but eventually, Kes, Zahir and the captain are left alone. Zahir explains to the captain that there is no such thing as a living asteroid in the space ahead of the {{USS|Voyager}} but points out that the asteroid in question is rich in [[vorilium]], whereupon the captain decides that might be worth a detour.  Later, The Doctor is in the [[holodeck]], discussing passion with [[Neelix]] and the [[holographic simulation]]s of two historical figures: [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and {{dis|Lord Byron|hologram}}.

The Doctor reacts to this in a rather uncharacteristic way, coming awfully close to her and when Torres tells him to back off, he instructs the computer to isolate the recent additions to the EMH program and hold them for review. He then explains to Torres the project he's been working on, whereupon she tells him to be careful with adding behavioral [[subroutine]]s to his program, as they have a tendency to interact with each other in unpredictable ways. She promises him to take a look at his program after her shift in engineering and as she leaves sickbay, The Doctor deactivates himself.  Meanwhile, Kes is with Zahir on the planet. They're walking an old path in a wooded area, left behind by other spacefarers like Zahir in long forgotten times. When they reach the end of the path, Kes discovers a strange kind of inscription in a rock. According to Zahir, it says ""''My course is as elusive as a shadow across the sky.''""  Kes thanks Zahir for the evening and they kiss, while a cloaked figure appears in the background watching them intently.  === Act Two === Back on ''Voyager'', a dreamy look in her eyes, Kes bumps into [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] [[Tuvok]] in the corridor, who reminds her that it's 0300 and that she has an away team report due at 0800. Kes assures him she hasn't forgotten and leaves. A few moments later, Kes enters sickbay, where The Doctor, who's working on a report Kes should have done but forgot, gives her a lecture about becoming increasingly unpredictable. She lashes out that everyone's treating her like a child and that she's not a child anymore, then assures The Doctor that she knows he cares about her and that she won't forget that. Then she goes to finish the report.  The next morning, Kes enters the [[captain's ready room]], looking very tired and after having handed her the report, asks to have a word with Janeway. She then proceeds to tell the captain that she wants to spend more time with [[Zahir]] and asks to be granted permission to temporarily leave the ship. The captain tells her to think about it for a few more days and Kes leaves.  That evening, Zahir and Tuvok are discussing which route ''Voyager'' should take to avoid the [[Tarkan]] sentries. Kes interrupts them and tells Zahir that she wants to spend time with him but must catch up on her sleep. Later Zahir walks the same path where he was with Kes the day before. Suddenly, he hears something and pulls out his weapon. He appears to have discovered something horrible on the ground before him but he is knocked off a cliff by the same cloaked figure that was there the day before. A few moments later, the cloaked figure enters Nakahn's lodge and pulls his cape off his head, revealing that he is The Doctor, with a curious expression in his eyes. He drags Nakahn's hands into the fire, then demands a ship and safe passage off the planet.  === Act Three ===  Kes enters sickbay the next morning and activates the [[EMH]]. The Doctor appears to be back to his normal self. When Kes tells him Zahir has been found unconscious and that he needs medical attention, nothing in his behavior suggests he knows anything about it and he's immediately prepared to help. However, as they reach the [[transporter room]], Torres stops them, telling The Doctor she needs to run a full [[diagnostic]] on his [[Holomatrix]], because something is wrong. While running the diagnostic, she explains to him that, while all the historical personalities he's chosen to incorporate into his program had some very admirable traits indeed, they also had less desirable attributes and all those, combined within The Doctor's personality, have caused his program to destabilize. She then asks him to deactivate himself so that she can purge his matrix of the added elements but when he attempts to do so, it doesn't work. He merely shimmers a bit.  Meanwhile, by the [[turbolift]], Tuvok is explaining to Janeway that the one who attacked Zahir has curiously left no tangible evidence of his crime at all on his victim. Also, Zahir cannot recall anything. Tuvok and Janeway make their way to sickbay and when they enter it, they find Torres unconscious on the floor. Tuvok activates the EMH and although he's a little irritated, he seems to be his normal self. He diagnoses Torres with delayed [[anaphylactic shock]] from the salad she ate the day before and puts her on a [[biobed]] for a few hours of observation.  After Tuvok and Janeway leave however, The Doctor starts to shimmer again. When he reappears, he's got the strange look in his eyes once more. He grabs a few [[hypospray]]s and goes over to Torres.  === Act Four ===   After waking her with one of them The Doctor tells her he simulated the anaphylactic shock using a drug and as she discovers that he has paralyzed her from the waist down to get her cooperation, she quickly realizes he has a new personality, created from the new subroutines. He tells her she is correct and that he wants to know from her how to delete The Doctor from his matrix, threatening to torture her if she doesn't. When Torres still refuses to help him, and his subroutines visibly begin to destabilize, he turns to the historical figures in the holodeck for help.  Meanwhile, Tuvok is interrogating Nakahn before going back to the scene of the crime and it's clear that he suspects him.  A few minutes later, Kes finds The Doctor in the holodeck, surrounded by all kinds of malfunctioning holograms. He explains to her that he's the new master of the EMH and the old Doctor is locked up inside him. He then takes her hostage and transports off the ship, after having created a dispersion pattern so that ''Voyager'' won't know where to look for them.  === Act Five === On the bridge [[Ensign]] [[Harry Kim]] reports an unscheduled transport. At the same time, Tuvok reports to the captain that he has found residual holographic signatures at the scene of the crime.    Meanwhile, The Doctor and Kes are in the lodge, waiting for Nakahn and the scout ship. The Doctor is attempting to remove the EMH from his program and Kes talks to him and for a moment. She explains to him that both should survive. It almost seems as if she's going to manage to convince him that a place can be found for both him and the original Doctor, until Nakahn enters and tells him he won't be able to escape, because Janeway and her crew have cordoned off the entire area. The Doctor flees, planning on taking the ship onto another continent but Janeway manages to disable the dispersion field long enough to get a lock on Kes' and The Doctor's location and transfers the coordinates to the [[away team]] on the planet.   Not long thereafter, the away team finds Kes and The Doctor and Tuvok blocks their path using a [[phaser]] to shoot some rocks down. The Doctor then threatens to jump off a cliff with Kes, eventually doing so; right at that moment, they are [[beam]]ed up to the ship. He is also apparently his normal self once again. Back in sick bay, Torres informs The Doctor that she has rid him of all the extra subroutines. Kes enters and The Doctor explains his gratitude that Kes has decided to remain on board ''Voyager'' with those that know her and care for her. The Doctor tells Kes that she’d have been missed, had she departed; realizing what he is trying to say, Kes responds that she’d have missed ''him '' too, and leaves sickbay. The Doctor considers what recently happened and recites to himself the Hippocratic Oath pledging that he will ''""do no harm"".''  "
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0," ==Short Plot Summary== Professor [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Farnsworth]] invents a [[Forwards Time Machine|time machine]] that can only travel forward in time, but not back again, hopefully to avoid creating confusing and disgusting paradoxes. This causes [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]], [[Bender Bending Rodríguez|Bender]], and Professor Farnsworth to be stuck in the future when the Professor accidentally turns the lever way too far.  ==Detailed Plot Summary== Bender keeps Fry up all night, therefore Fry oversleeps and arrives at [[Planet Express]] – around the time he is supposed to meet [[Turanga Leela|Leela]] at [[Elzar's Fine Cuisine]] for her birthday lunch. When he finally arrives, Leela has already eaten both of their meals, she then leaves Fry the bill and storms out.   Fry tries to make it up to her and tells her he will meet her for dinner at the [[Cavern on the Green]] – although this means he will miss [[Hedonismbot]]'s ""Girls Gone Wildest"" bachelor party. Just as Fry wants to leave (on time) to meet Leela, the Professor makes him try his new one-way time machine. Fry has gotten Leela a record-a-message card and says he'll just have to film it in the machine. They are supposed to go one minute into the future but the professor slips and they go [[10,000|6,990]] years instead, during which Fry's card flies out the machine's window. Later that night (in the year [[3010]]) everyone at [[Hedonismbot|Hedionismbot's]] party but him dies due to an atomic powered hooker bot meltdown. Leela, having been stood up again, thinks Bender, the Professor and Fry were at the party. She is ""sad.. but still angry... is it possible to be both?""  The involuntary time-travelers try to go forward in time until they reach an era where humanity has developed a backwards time-machine. Meanwhile, in [[3030]], Leela misses Fry and hits on [[Cubert J. Farnsworth|Cubert]] for his (perceived) similarity to Fry. Meanwhile Fry, Bender and the Professor, after visiting several eras in Earth's future, involving several parodies of H. G. Wells' ''The Time Machine'', a third Ice Age in [[105105]], [[252,525|ostrich-riding knights]] in [[252,525|252525]], a dystopian [[New New York]], an [[1,000,000½|era of humanity enslaved by giraffes]] in [[1,000,000½]], then come to [[5,000,000|a future where robots enslave/destroy humanity]] in [[10,000,000]] and of course Bender immediately likes it. Fry and Hubert, however, are not impressed by the mountain of skulls (nor by the gorgeous view over the blood lake) and push the machine forward to [[50,000,000]], [[50,000,000|a future where there are beautiful women]], the few males are in high demand (even the dumb and old ones) and backwards time-travel has been developed. Bender, still angry at Fry and Hubert, activates the time-machine again to get even.  40 years after Fry's 'death' in [[3050]], ''Planet Express'' has developed into a big and successful company. Leela has found that Cubert is not really like Fry at all and has divorced him after an he had affair with [[Amy Wong|Cyborg-Amy]]. Suddenly, Fry's birthday card appears out of thin air as the time machine shoots through time, revealing that that was when it flew out the window. Leela learns that she was angry at Fry for no reason and that while he is alive somewhere in the future (with Hubert and Bender), they won't meet again.  She goes to the ''Cavern on the Green'' and leaves a message for Fry by shooting holes in the ceiling. The water dripping from the holes will form stalagmites, making the message visible and Leela hopes that perhaps at some point in the future Fry will see her message. Meanwhile, in the year [[1,000,000,000]], all life on [[Earth]] has become extinct. Fry finds Leela's message and seems content with his life. He suggests to skip even further forward in time and watch the end of the universe, Hubert and Bender agree.  After all the stars explode and the last proton decays, the group gets bored. Surprisingly a new ''big bang'' occurs and a new, identical universe is created. They watch the creation of the Sun, Earth and Moon, evolution, dinosaurs, ""history"" (Hubert also takes the opportunity to vaporize [[Adolf Hitler]]) and finally arrive back at the time they left. The Professor slips again, however, so they have to ""bring her 'round again."" So they take a second trip through time (this time Bender takes the controls, causing Hubert to miss Hitler and hit Eleanor Roosevelt instead) and on their second approach on the destination time they accidentally crush their alternative selves. Fry rushes off and makes it in time to the ''Cavern on The Green''. As the two stand on a bridge, with Bender burying their time-paradox duplicates underneath, Fry apologizes to Leela for losing her card. She tells him that it is okay, because what she will always remember is their time together. They both look up at the stars together while Bender buries the corpses of the Fry, Bender and Hubert from the New Universe.  ==Time Travel Metaphysics== After ending the lives of Bender, Fry and Professor Farnsworth from the final universe they travel to, Professor Farnsworth mentions that they have inadvertently settled a time travel paradox. This is because the original trio skipped over one universe. Just as the trio from the original universe (Uni 1) skipped one universe on their journey forward through time, the Fry, Bender and Professor Farnsworth from the skipped universe (Uni 2) will also skip one universe (Uni 3/the Universe the original trio landed in and crushed their counterparts)  to land in a potential fourth universe (Uni 4) in which they should crush their Uni 4 counterparts, ending the time travel paradox.  To further explain the paradox, take note that due to the events in Uni 1 in which Leela goes on to build up Planet Express into a major corporation and later leaving a message for Fry to find at some point in the future, It can be safely assumed that no version of Fry, Bender, or Professor Farnsworth landed in Uni 1 from a previous universe. This means Uni 1 is the beginning of the time travel paradox. This also means that no version of Fry, Bender and Professor Farnsworth should arrive in Uni 2 since the original trio from Uni 1 do not stop until Uni 3. Therefore, Uni 2 Leela should commit the same actions as Uni 1 Leela, and Uni 2 Fry will also find the same message that Uni 1 Fry found.  If the trio from Uni 1 were to arrive just after the trio from Uni 3 departed, due to normal continuation of Uni 3 with the Uni 1 trio taking the Uni 3 trio's place, then Uni 3 Leela would not follow the actions that would lead to her leaving the message for Uni 3 Fry to find, potentially altering the course of the Uni 3 trio's journey and disrupting the established pattern. Possibilities are infinite and could disrupt the temporal flux of the SpaceTime Continuum to the point that all Universes are destroyed.  Since the trio from Uni 1 crushed to death and assumed the lives of the trio from Uni 3 after skipping over Uni 2, it can be assumed that the trio from Uni 2 will crush to death and assume the lives of the trio of Uni 4, settling the paradox as no forward travels will come from Uni 3 or Uni 4. This means that, assuming the universe continues to replicate, the cycle will start over with Uni 5 being the beginning of the next paradox block, repeating all events of Uni 1 to uni 4 within the time block of Uni 5 to Uni 8. This four universe block pattern could continue indefinitely. This repeating cycle is possible because while all matter in each universe eventually decays completely before the next universe is born into existence, time and space continue to exist through all universes indefinitely.  This means that every universe is five feet lower than the previous, as Universe 3 was found to be ten feet lower than Fry, Bender and Hubert's universe of origin (Uni 1).  It can be theorized that the reason the universe repeats itself during the trio's voyage is, in fact, their continued existence following their universe's collapse, even as a time-traveling anomaly, meaning their very presence affects the new universe's formation, namely in repeating the universal timeline resulting in their creation, life and circumstances leading to their flight (Hereby explaining why the universe is an exact duplicate). In this case, it would also mean that the cycle would not repeat past Universe 4.  Another possibility is that in Uni 2, due to the Uni 1 Hubert killing Uni 2 Hitler, the expected future was altered in such a way that the Uni 2 trio simply continue to exist, do not travel into the next universe, or may not even exist, necessitating that Uni 1 Hubert try to shoot Hitler on the second go around into Uni 3. This is because a trio from Uni 2 will not feel the inclination to take out Hitler because someone else already had. This means that if a trio from Uni 2 does exist and travels into the future universes, then it can be assumed that if they land in Uni 4, They would be landing in a universe in which Hitler lived, different from there universe of origin (Uni 2) in which Hitler was killed by the Hubert from Uni 1, creating a new paradox..  Their presence may also be the actual motivation for the formation of the universe. One thesis for the universe's end involves it settling into a ""dark era"", or losing all heat, hereby all energy and dying, but travelling through time in any direction requires near-infinite amounts of energy and if the machine's energy was discharged to the dead universe, it could very well have facilitated a second big bang (being a source of incredibly dense energy). Still, this is pure conjecture.  While also conjecture, the fact the universe repeats itself could also explain how Nibblonian civilization existed 17 years before the Big Bang.  This episode makes Fry even more of an anomaly in time and space than he has ever been before. He was his own grandfather in the universe he was born, gifting him with a lack of a Delta Brain Wave and making his existence cyclical and now the current Fry is living in a universe that he was not even born into, making him as a time traveler no longer subject to alterations in the time stream anywhere in the current universe. Additionally, Bender and Hubert are also not subject to alterations in the time stream.   {{EpisodeListBroadcastOrder}}"

==Summary==
===Teaser===
In the [[Replimat]] on [[Deep Space 9]], [[Dr.]] [[Julian Bashir]] recalls when he fought the ""''toughest battle of my life''"" to an attractive [[Bajoran DS9 female 003|Bajoran woman]], while [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien]] sits in the background, listening and occasionally rolling his eyes. Bashir remembers that during his [[Starfleet Medical]] exam, he was the last person in the room and there was no one else he could turn to for help. Bashir says that he considered quitting the exam, as he could feel the [[second]]s ticking away. Then, he says he closed his eyes, took a deep breath and he remembered the answer, a [[pericardial membrane]]. He entered the answer in just before it was too late. He tells her that it is the stuff that [[salutatorian]]s are made of. The Bajoran woman wonders why he only made salutatorian. In response, Bashir tells her that during the exam, he mistook a pre-ganglionic fiber for a post-ganglionic nerve. If not for that trick question, Bashir tells her he would have been [[valedictorian]]. Bashir begins to tell her more, but then [[Commander]] [[Benjamin Sisko]] calls both Bashir and O'Brien to landing pad five. At the docking hatch, Sisko and [[Major]] [[Kira Nerys]] are desperately trying to open the door to the [[runabout]] {{USS|Ganges}}. The ''Ganges'' has lost all power and [[oxygen]] levels have dropped dangerously low since the ship emerged from the [[Bajoran wormhole]]. Inside the ''Ganges'' are [[Lieutenant]] [[Jadzia Dax]] and [[Ensign]] [[Pauley]]. Bashir scans with his [[medical tricorder]] and asks Sisko how many people are supposed to be inside the runabout. Sisko tells him that there are supposed to be two, but Bashir tells him that he is reading three. Kira suggests firing her [[Bajoran phaser]] at the door, but Sisko tells her the door hatch is made of [[duranium]] composite; it will take her an hour to burn through. O'Brien then tells Kira to hand him an EPI capacitor, which will re-energize the servos and thus open the door hatch. The hatch opens, with assistance from Sisko and Kira. The crew enters the ''Ganges''. O'Brien helps a woman get to her feet and realizes it is [[Vash]], whom he knew from the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-D|-D}}. O'Brien asks how she got on board. Dax replies that they found her in the [[Gamma Quadrant]], where she has been residing for the [[2367|last two years]]. Sisko advises Bashir to take everyone to the [[infirmary]]. O'Brien asks Vash how she got to the Gamma Quadrant by herself. She replies that a friend brought her there. As everyone leaves for the infirmary, [[Q]] turns around and grins.

===Act One===
In the infirmary, Bashir scans Vash and finds her to be in perfect health for someone who has been in the Gamma Quadrant for two years and has not had touch with civilization for that long. Vash tells Bashir that the Gamma Quadrant is hardly uncivilized, as there are cultures that have been around for millions of years. In Sisko's office, Sisko discusses with Dax how Vash got to the Gamma Quadrant, as she knew nothing about the wormhole and did not use it to get there. Sisko orders Dax to look into it. In the station's [[assay office]], Vash brings in valuable objects she acquired from the Gamma Quadrant for safe keeping, as she is leaving the next day. Sisko walks to the office and begins talking to Vash. They walk out of the assay office into the [[Promenade]]. Sisko tells Vash that the [[Daystrom Institute]] will be disappointed not to hear from her, as they are anxious to hear what life is like in the Gamma Quadrant. Sisko also discreetly tries to inquire how Vash ended up in the Gamma Quadrant, but she tells him it is a personal matter and she does not want to talk about it. One of Vash's old [[professor]]s, [[Woo]], wants to speak with her again, which Vash finds ironic, since Woo suspended her membership, twice. Sisko hopes she'll make an exception in this case. Vash replies that it has been [[2357|twelve years]] since she has been on [[Earth]] and she thinks she may go back. Sisko promises to arrange passage for her.

While conducting repairs on the ''Ganges'', O'Brien cannot find out why the ship lost power so suddenly. The runabout is now in perfect condition, despite what happened to it earlier. O'Brien replies that once new power reserves are put into the ''Ganges'', it should be fully operational. O'Brien tells Sisko that it is like something drained the ship dry. Sisko asks O'Brien how well he knows Vash. O'Brien replies that he hardly knows her at all, apart from the one time she was on board the ''Enterprise''. Sisko asks what she was doing there. O'Brien tells Sisko that Vash and [[Captain]] [[Jean-Luc Picard]] were very, very close on the ''Enterprise'', ever since they [[Captain's Holiday (episode)|first met]] on [[Risa]] [[2366|a few years back]]. Sisko tells O'Brien that Vash does not seem to be Picard's type, but O'Brien tells him that the captain likes a good challenge. Suddenly, the power goes down in the [[corridor]] O'Brien and Sisko are standing in. The power returns. Sisko and O'Brien make their way to [[Operations center|Ops]], where Sisko asks for a status report. Kira tells him that power has drained. Dax tells the crew that the station's power drain is exactly what happened to the ''Ganges''.

===Act Two===
O'Brien escorts Vash to her [[quarters]]. Vash asks O'Brien how Picard is doing. O'Brien tells her that the last time he saw him, he seemed fine. Vash tells him that now she is back in the [[Alpha Quadrant]], she will have to look him up. Vash enters her quarters and finds Q there, who cannot believe that she is still pining for Picard, whom he still believes to be a ""self-righteous do-gooder"".

Vash wants to part ways with Q, but Q does not want to leave her. He suggests they still explore the [[Milky Way Galaxy|galaxy]], as there is still the [[Delta Quadrant]] and many other exotic [[planet]]s to see. Then, Vash's door opens to [[Quark]], the [[Ferengi]] bar owner on the station. Q tells him to go away and makes him disappear. Vash makes Q return Quark, which he does. Quark tells Vash that he has heard that she has several items from the Gamma Quadrant that may have enormous financial value. Quark believes he may be able to arrange an [[auction]] for Vash's items, for a fifty-fifty split of the profits. Vash, unsatisfied, goes over to Quark and performs ''[[oo-mox]]'' on him. As she does so, he lowers his cut of the profits in [[gold-pressed latinum]] to twenty-two percent. Q reappears, telling Vash that if Quark was the kind of man she was with before, it is no wonder she was attracted to Picard. The doorbell rings and Q disappears again. Vash answers. Dr. Bashir enters and asks Vash out to dinner at [[Quark's]]. She accepts, but asks Bashir to wait for her, so she can freshen up. While Bashir is waiting for Vash in the Replimat, Q, disguised as a [[Bajoran]] waiter, tells Bashir not to meet with Vash. Bashir takes offense to this and tells Q that it is none of his business and he will be seeing her soon. Q tells Bashir that he looks tired and makes him yawn. Bashir, now very tired, leaves and goes to bed. O'Brien sees Q walking away and exclaims ""''Bloody hell.''""

At Ops, O'Brien tells Sisko that Q is on board the station. When Kira asks what Q is, Sisko replies that he is a powerful and extremely unpredictable lifeform. Dax asks what Q wants with them, and Sisko responds that whatever it is, they can be sure they won't like it. O'Brien suggests Vash might know, and when Sisko asks if Q and Vash would know each other from the ''Enterprise'', O'Brien responds that they met in [[Sherwood Forest]]. O'Brien tells them [[Qpid (episode)|it was one of the jokes Q played with the ''Enterprise'' crew]]. Then, the station's power drains, yet again. O'Brien suggests, since the there has been nothing wrong with the systems for the first time in a month, that Q must be playing a game with them. At Quark's, Vash and Quark inspect one of Vash's items, a large [[embryonic lifeform|crystalline jewel]]. Vash and Quark discuss what the crystal will be worth at the auction, until Sisko enters Quark's demanding to talk to Vash. Sisko wants her to tell him about Q. However, Q is already in Quark's and asks Sisko if [[Starfleet]] is punishing Sisko or if he actually requested command of Deep Space 9.

===Act Three===

Commander Sisko orders Q to vacate DS9, but Q intends to bring excitement to the droll [[Cardassian]] construct. Q then notices the [[Starfleet uniform (late 2360s-early 2370s)|new uniforms]] that the station crew wear, accordingly altering his own attire looking identical to Sisko's uniform. But Sisko isn't impressed by Q's abilities and demands the cessation of power outages afflicting DS9. Q accepts blame for this if it makes the commander feel better, subtly hinting that he is not responsible. In the course of their conversation Q causes every person on the space station to disappear with the exception of himself and the station commander. In a fit of alarm, Sisko violently grabs hold of Q demanding the immediate return of everyone. Entertained and seeking to further antagonize Sisko, Q suggests they settle the matter ""mano a mano.""

Temporarily transforming Quark's Bar into a boxing arena, he begins bouncing about Sisko and landing blows. Humorously, Quark and Vash wager on the sideline. Q keeps insisting that his opponent fight back, ultimately an annoyed Sisko knocks him down. Upon being struck to the ground a seemingly bewildered Q says, ""''You hit me. Picard never hit me.''""; Sisko answers, ""''I'm not Picard.''"" Q is very pleased to find a command-level Starfleet officer who is much easier to provoke than the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-D|-D}}'s captain, and he vanishes in a flash.

Arriving at Deep Space 9, numerous aliens who are attending Vash's auction head towards Quark's, which catches the suspicious eye of [[Constable]] [[Odo]]. Yet again station power levels drop and the [[atmosphere]] in Ops begins to vent, fortunately though O'Brien is able to activate shielding. Investigating one of the [[hull breach]]es that happened, Dax scans with her [[tricorder]] and finds that the damage was caused by a focused [[graviton pulse]], concluding that Q is the cause although Sisko thinks otherwise. 

As per Odo's request Quark arrives at the station security office, where the constable informs the bartender that he is aware concerning the upcoming auction of [[Gamma Quadrant]] artifacts. Quark reacts with surprise to this and is a bit angered at being spied on by the local law enforcement, surmising that Odo had shapeshifted into an article of furniture or perhaps the liquor bottle. Odo remarks that the devious Quark cannot keep secrets from him. Quark defends his business venture, but Odo is actually interested in the clientele. In their conversation Odo mentions that he fails to fathom the logic of materialism and greed; the Ferengi then proceeds to tempt the ever spartan Odo with material desire: a suit made of [[Andorian silk]], a ring made of [[surax]], a [[latinum]]-[[plating|plated]] [[Odo's bucket|regeneration bucket]]. Odo momentarily considers the bucket, but rejects it. 

On the Promenade, Q walks with Vash and again attempts to persuade her to stay with him, pointing out the safety she's had due to him. Vash tells Q that she does not require him or his protection in a dangerous universe. Q thus painfully reminds her of a harmful [[insect]] bite she received on [[Erabus Prime]] which he cured, then causing Vash to physically react as if bitten again. First she experiences irregular balding and her remaining hair becomes lighter in coloration, then something like hives appear on various areas of her body, finally her skin becomes pale and her hair greys as she collapses to the floor from weakness shaking and moaning. Q departs from Vash and allows her to reconsider their so-called friendship, restoring her to health. A man helps the woman up and she continues to Quark's as onlookers gawk.

===Act Four===

In Sisko's [[station log]], he notes that the station's power is continuing to be drained and is being converted into gravitons. If the drain continues, Deep Space 9's [[life support system]] will go offline in less than fourteen hours. The station's Cardassian [[sensor]]s are not sensitive enough to detect where the power outages are coming from, according to O'Brien. Dax suggests that if they flood the station with [[ion]]ized [[tritium]] [[gas]], they could trace the [[particle]] flow to the source of the power outages. Not seeing another choice, Sisko orders it done. Then, Q appears on Ops and remarks that Picard and the crew of the ''Enterprise''-D would have solved this problem ages ago. O'Brien tells Q to go do something constructive, like tormenting Cardassians. Q asks if he knows O'Brien. O'Brien tells him he was from the ''Enterprise''. Q remarks that he must have been one of the little people. Q gives Sisko a hint of where the power outages are coming from and tells the crew that Vash is far more dangerous to DS9 than Q is. 

In Quark's, {{dis|Kolos|Andoran}}, one of the alien bidders, walks up to Quark. He remarks that the Gamma Quadrant merchandise had better be legitimate, or else he will throw Quark out of the nearest airlock. Quark assures him that each item has been authenticated by Vash, who is the [[Federation]]'s expert on the Gamma Quadrant. Since that is now out of the way, Kolos asks Quark for a [[synthale]]. Quark talks more with Vash and proposes a lucrative business venture with her. Vash insists to Quark that she has slept in her last [[tent]], as she is looking forward to living on Earth again. Then, the station shakes. At Ops, Kira, at her station, is reading that DS9 is being pulled out of its normal position. Sisko orders that [[thruster]]s be used to stabilize the station, but that does nothing to stop it from moving. O'Brien suggests that the station's [[fusion reactor|reactors]] be shut down in order to stop the feeding of the station's power to the graviton field. Sisko orders it be done. This, however, does nothing to stop the movement of DS9. Sisko asks Dax to ascertain where the station is headed. The [[coordinates]] have Deep Space 9 heading straight for the Bajoran wormhole.

===Act Five===

At Quark's, the alien bidders are unaware of the station approaching its impending destruction. Quark reminds everyone that payment must be in gold-pressed latinum and that all transactions are final. Vash then holds up a statue of [[Drohlak]] from the [[Verathan]] civilization in the Gamma Quadrant. She proceeds to go into a long discussion about the history of the Verathan civilization, which begins to bore the bidders. Quark tells Vash that this is not the Daystrom Institute, she does not need to put the statue in its proper historical context, rather Quark tells the bidders that it is rare, beautiful and it is an original Gamma Quadrant piece. The bidding begins. O'Brien starts to flood DS9 with tritium gas and Dax begins a sensor sweep. The first part of the station to be cleared is the [[docking ring]]. The tritium gas is draining toward the central core of the station, but O'Brien cannot pinpoint its exact location. Kira notes that the station will collide with the wormhole in eighteen minutes. During the bidding, Kolos has won the statue of Drohlak for thirty six bars of gold-pressed latinum. Bidding continues with a dagger. Q, sitting casually behind the bidders, tells them that the station is hurtling toward the Bajoran wormhole and that they will not live long enough to enjoy their purchases. Quark attempts to calm the bidders down by assuring them that everything is under control. The bidding resumes, with Quark's cousin [[Stol]] winning the dagger for a hundred and five bars of gold-pressed latinum.

With the situation getting worse, Dax suggests returning the station to full power, so they will generate enough energy to create a power drain to trace the source of the station's problems. Seeing no other choice, Sisko orders O'Brien to bring the station to full power. Quark brings out the final auction item, the large crystalline jewel. The starting bid is two hundred bars of gold-pressed latinum. Soon, the bidding reaches six hundred bars of latinum. At Ops, the crew is desperately trying to find the source of the station's power drains. Dax finally locates it, on the Promenade. Kira and Dax leave, Sisko accompanies them and leaves O'Brien in charge. At Quark's, the bidding has reached 2,500 bars, which astonishes Quark. Q then proceeds to bid 2,501 bars. Sisko, Kira and Dax reach the Promenade and scan with tricorders. Dax locates the item in Quark's. Kolos makes a final bid with three thousand bars. Q then bids a million bars on the item. Sisko, Kira and Dax head over to the item up for sale. Sisko removes his [[combadge]] and places it on the jewel. He orders O'Brien to shut down the reactors and beam the object into [[space]], five hundred meters off of the docking ring. The object is beamed five hundred meters away from the docking ring and begins to transform. Sisko, Kira, Dax, and Vash look outside the Promenade's windows as the creature they have just released heads into the wormhole and back to the Gamma Quadrant.

Vash is preparing to leave DS9 for Earth. While she sits at the bar and has a drink, Quark entices her with news that a [[Rokai]] provincial capital has just been uncovered at [[Tartaras V]]. Vash decides not to go, as she has her mind set on Earth. Q appears again, calling Earth an abysmal place, although he notes that Earth once had a lot of character a thousand years ago, with the [[crusades]], the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and [[Watergate]]. Q tells her she would be much happier exploring Tartaras V instead of being on Earth. Q then decides to leave Vash and admits he is going to miss her. Q vanishes again. Vash grabs Quark's [[lobe]] and asks him what the quickest way is to Tartaras V. Quark leads her away, just as Bashir awakes from a long sleep induced by Q. He walks up to Dax in the bar and asks ""''Did I miss something''""?

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"  == Summary == === Teaser === While a [[Cardassian]] [[freighter]], the ''[[Bok'Nor]]'', is docked at [[Deep Space 9]], a [[Human]] posing as a [[Starfleet]] maintenance worker tampers with a nearby wall panel. At [[Operations center|Ops]], [[Jadzia Dax]] tells [[Major]] [[Kira Nerys|Kira]] that she has a dinner date with the [[Gallamite]] [[Captain]] [[Boday]]. Kira expresses unease at dating someone with a transparent skull, through which she can see his brain, and the two have a brief verbal exchange over choice of dates and aesthetics. The [[docking clamp]]s in upper Pylon 1 are released, but Dax picks up an anomaly. She tells the ''Bok'Nor'' to shut down their engines. Suddenly, the freighter explodes while leaving the station. Kira orders engineering personnel to report to rescue stations, but a stunned Dax informs her that there is nothing left of the freighter &ndash; and no one to rescue.  === Act One === Kira and [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]] subsequently investigate the incident in a [[runabout]], and initially detect traces of [[kelindide]] and [[rhodinium]], materials used in the construction of Cardassian vessels. Kira asks if there may have been a malfunction in the [[impulse generator]], but O'Brien tells her it’s too soon to be sure. He then informs [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] that there is no evidence of explosive devices. Frustrated, Sisko tells him several Starfleet [[admiral]]s are pressing him for answers, but O'Brien advises him not to pass on that it ''looks'' like an accident. Traces of [[mercassium]] are then found in the debris, which should not have been there at all. [[Odo]] asks if mercassium is an explosive but Sisko tells him it’s a synthetic composite used in [[shield generator]] construction by the [[Federation]], one they do not share with others. Dax then expounds her belief that the explosion was an implosive [[protomatter]] device attached to the ''Bok'Nor''{{'}}s [[impulse engine]]s, based upon a sudden increase in the vessel’s fusion rate she detected just prior to the explosion. Her belief is supported by the total lack of evidence of an on-board malfunction. O'Brien supports the theory by stating that a protomatter device attached to the ''Bok'Nor''{{'}}s crossfeeds could have caused an undetectable explosion, but is forced to inform Sisko that he needs to perform a high resolution spectra of the debris to be sure.  [[Commander]] [[Calvin Hudson]], the ranking officer and [[attaché]] in the [[Demilitarized Zone]] along the [[Cardassian border]], arrives on the station to investigate the possibility of retaliatory attacks. After a few introductions, they talk in Sisko's office. He briefly catches up with Sisko, but the gravity of the situation comes back. He admits his belief that his presence on the border is a joke; his assignment has been to help colonists, whose land the Federation gave to Cardassia, adjust to the new circumstances. He believes the Federation is abandoning them due to a bad [[Federation-Cardassian Treaty|treaty]], clearly in disagreement. Contrary to [[Starfleet]]'s belief, Hudson is sure the Cardassians will not retaliate, but he guarantees a response will come, since the Cardassians never show anyone what they are really planning.  Meanwhile, a covert meeting takes place between the saboteur and a [[Vulcan]] on the [[Promenade]]. Pretending to read a directory sign, the Vulcan whispers that he has [[quarters]] while a ship arrives for him to escape. The Vulcan then visits [[Quark]] to offer him a business proposition. He assumes it's due to an earlier bad deal he made with the Vulcans, but, when she assures him that's not the case, he's immediately excited. Introducing herself as [[Sakonna]], she insists it should be a private meeting, so they plan to meet later for dinner.   However, Sakonna and the saboteur were observed from above by a [[Pelian]] [[Pelian DS9 visitor 003|couple]]. Later, they abduct him in the habitat ring as he goes to his quarters.  === Act Two === Arriving at his quarters that evening, Sisko finds [[Gul]] [[Dukat]] waiting for him. Sisko immediately asks where [[Jake Sisko|Jake]] is, implying Dukat may have done something to him. Dukat is shocked by this but Sisko bluntly states he believes the Cardassian to be capable of anything, further wounding Dukat with the remark. Sisko then calls Kira to find Jake, without alerting her to Dukat's presence. Dukat explains that he came aboard DS9 as an unregistered [[passenger]] on a [[Kotakian ship]], and has used his knowledge as the station's former commander to move around stealthily. Kira then contacts Sisko to reassure him that Jake is fine and with [[Nog]], observing women disembark a [[Bajoran transport 007|Bajoran transport]] at [[Docking bay|Docking Bay 1]]. Dukat states he has come unofficially, without the [[Cardassian Central Command]]'s knowledge, to help Sisko find the truth about the destruction of the ''Bok'Nor'', for he believes he knows what happened &ndash; renegade Starfleet officers. In order to find the truth, the two of them must take a runabout to the [[Volan colonies]] in the demilitarized zone, which Dukat describes as ""not so demilitarized I'm afraid.""   Soon after in a runabout, Dukat notes that his controls are not illuminated meaning he will be unable to [[pilot]] the vessel in the event of an emergency, and assures Sisko he does not intend to [[steal]] technical information. Sisko responds by reminding him of Cardassians' [[eidetic memory|photographic memories]], drawing the quip from Dukat that having the controls unilluminated will prevent him from taking a photograph. Sisko asks him if what he has heard about Cardassian [[children]] undergoing mind training programmes from the age of four is true; Dukat proudly states the Cardassian [[education]] is unparalleled in the [[Alpha Quadrant|quadrant]]. Sisko opines this method takes the joy out of growing up; Dukat counters, ""''Education is power. Joy is vulnerability.''"" He then receives a [[distress call]] from a [[Federation merchant vessel]], attacked by two [[Cardassian attack vessel]]s. Dukat says they are not authorized to violate the treaty, and must have come from Cardassian colonies. He tries two direct [[hail]]s, but they do not disengage. Before the runabout can intervene, another Federation vessel arrives and quickly destroys the Cardassians. Sisko doesn't recognize the ship, as it appears to have been modified to carry [[photon torpedo]]es. Dukat asks if Sisko now realizes the infighting that has been going on amongst the colonists, without either of their governments knowing about it.  === Act Three ===  Back on the station, Quark has arranged a ""business"" dinner with Sakonna. She is eager to begin negotiations but he quotes one of the [[Rules of Acquisition]]: ""Never begin a [[business negotiation]] on an empty stomach."" When he describes the Rules of Acquisition, she finds them logical and ""quite reassuring."" Once Quark is ready to discuss business, he is surprised to hear she is looking to acquire weapons: she wishes to acquire a continuous supply of ""''[[gun]]s, [[phaser bank]]s, photon torpedoes, [[troop transport]]s, and a number of [[cobalt-thorium device]]s,''"" among others. ""''You're not like other Vulcans, are you?''"", Quark says.  In the demilitarized zone on [[Volan III]], Gul [[Evek]], the Cardassian attaché to the demilitarized zone, is in a heated debate with Cal Hudson and the colony's council when Dukat and Sisko enter the room. Evek appears to not have been aware of Dukat's involvement. When they describe the incident they observed, both sides seem to feel that their colonists were justified. Evek then produces a confession from the ''Bok'Nor'' saboteur, [[William Patrick Samuels]], but claims that Samuels committed [[suicide]] shortly after giving it. One of the colonists present named [[Amaros]] attacks Evek and must be restrained.  === Act Four ===  Later that night, Hudson warns Sisko that the Cardassians have no intention of allowing the Federation colonists to stay and tells him the ''Bok'Nor'' was likely transporting weapons to Cardassian colonists. He concedes that Samuels might have destroyed the freighter but claims the colonists have the right to defend themselves. Furthermore, the authorities themselves are involved in the conflict, arming their civilians. Sisko says if it's true, the Federation can use diplomatic channels, but Hudson scoffs at that, saying they'll find discreet ways of supplying them. Sisko then mentions the Cardassian's [[The Circle (episode)|supply of weapons]] to [[Alliance for Global Unity|Bajoran extremists]], suggesting the ''Bok'Nor'' could have carried the weapons to a third party before it was destroyed at Deep Space 9. Hudson has to leave to tell [[Louise Samuels|Samuels' wife]] about his death, and briefly reminisces about their time at [[New Berlin]], specifically the fun they and their wives had at the [[Mazurka Festival]]. Sisko then asks if something bigger is going on, but Hudson says he's not aware.   On the way back to Deep Space 9, Dukat otes that Sisko is quiet; he is angry at the reckless actions taken that will eventually hurt the treaty. Sisko then guesses that Dukat knew of Samuels' confession. Dukat admits it, but claims he knew nothing of the ""suicide"", and that he told Evek he was a fool for letting Samuels die.  Sisko is further angered by his assertion that Samuels' death had no advantage for the purpose of interrogation, but Dukat counters by reminding him of Samuels' murderous actions. However, he swears on the lives of his seven children that the ''Bok'Nor'' was not transporting weapons, despite the fact that it could have rendezvoused with a third party in order to do so.  Back on the station, Sisko gives Dukat quarters and security before he is transported back home. In Ops, O'Brien has confirmed what Sisko believed: the bomb that destroyed the ''Bok'Nor'' was of Federation origin. As Sisko prepares to contact Starfleet, Kira starts a heated argument in his office, as she believes that the Federation should be protecting their own colonists ahead of their treaty with the Cardassians, which she believes will be violated by the Cardassians at every opportunity. Sisko then opens the door to his office, asking Kira to leave.  Meanwhile, Sakonna requests that Quark move the weapon shipment schedule forward to that night and he complies greedily. Later on, she and [[Niles|a man]] posing as a Starfleet security guard subdue [[Human DS9 ops security 008|the guard]] posted to Dukat's quarters with a [[Vulcan nerve pinch]]. They lead him to an airlock under false pretenses and are joined by Amaros and [[Hudson cell Human colonists 001|another of the colonists]]. They [[kidnap]] Dukat by rendering him unconscious with a phaser.  === Act Five === Sisko and the rest of the crew determine the course the kidnappers most likely took. A [[Galador freighter]] left, but Dax confirms the registry was forged, as the [[Galadoran]]s don't have a ship in the sector. It was heading toward [[Farius Prime]], but now they know it is a false route. Just as he, Kira and [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]] leave Ops to go back to the demilitarized zone, Kira reports an anonymous transmission from there attributing the bombing of the ''Bok'Nor'' and the recent kidnappings to a group calling itself the [[Maquis]].   On the runabout, O'Brien reports that fortunately a [[Klingon 24th freighter 002|Klingon freighter]] reported the freighter's location. They follow the Maquis into an area called the [[Badlands]] with which Bashir is unfamiliar. Kira explains that it is an area of the Cardassian border with frequent [[plasma storm]]s, which pilots generally try to avoid. ""''Sounds like the perfect place for a hideout,''"" he observes. They beam to the surface of an [[Class M]] [[asteroid]], where the armed Maquis members emerge from nearby foliage &ndash; followed by Hudson, now out of {{dis|Starfleet uniform|late 2360s-early 2370s|uniform}}.

Fry and Bender sell Popplers on the street for $1 a dozen, with great success. [[Joseph Gillman|Fishy Joe]] makes the crew an offer to sell the treats at his chain of seafood restaurants for $2 a dozen, of which they get half. Fry and Bender record a [[Poppler's song]], and Fishy Joe's sells over one million popplers.   Protesters rally outside the [[Planet Express Building]], lead by anti-eating activist [[Free Waterfall, Jr.]], a Poppler [[Turanga Leela|Leela]] is about to eat suddenly opens its eyes and says ""Mama"" to her. Realizing that Popplers are intelligent, she joins the activists in protesting the trade of Popplers. At first, the crew reasonably think she is delusional, but when [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] suggests they  dissect its brain, the terrified Poppler begs for protection. Shocked, they then vow to help Leela's cause, although they do not get much headway. Leela wears a sign saying ""Free the Popplers"" while a guy dressed as a Poppler wears a ""Free Popplers"" sin and contradicts whatever she says. [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] handcuffs himself to a revolving door to stop people from going into a Fishy Joe's restaurant, leading to him literally getting walked on. Bender tells people to stop eating Popplers, but ends up encouraging them instead. A televised debate between Fishy Joe, Free Waterfall, Jr., and Leela is interrupted when the [[Omicronians]] arrive on Earth, and reveal ""Popplers"" are their babies, that came from one of their nursery planets. The Omicronians vow revenge for the eating of their young, the initial demand being that Earth ""serve"" one human for each of the 198 billion Popplers eaten. However, during negotiations with [[Zapp Brannigan]], it is revealed that they are not enough humans on Earth for the Omicronians to eat, so they eventually settle on Leela to be presented for consumption, for being the first person to eat Popplers.   While Lrrr waits to eat Leela on live television, Zapp formulates a devious plan to use an orangutan as a substitute for Leela, in the hopes that the [[Omicronians]]' inability to tell humans apart can be exploited. [[Kif Kroker|Kif]] attempts to give the ape a makeover as best as he can. Oblivious to the danger it places Leela in, Free Waterfall, Jr. reveals it is an orangutan. [[Ndnd]] confirms this by eating it anyway and Lrrr demands that the real Leela be fed to him at once. Only the intervention of [[Jrrr]], the Poppler Leela found, saves her. Lrrr decides to eat Free Waterfall, Jr. instead for getting on his nerves, but becomes intoxicated as a result of eating him and the crew retires to a meal which includes a dolphin, which they deem as unintelligent because ""he blew all his money on instant lottery tickets.""

==Plot==
Young teenager Bobby Thornberry is dropped off at a funeral home. He walks in as a memorial service is happening and awkwardly drops his suitcase, briefly halting it. He spots his uncle [[Ezra Thornberry]], the funeral director, comforting guests and kindly ushering them out of the room; but as soon as he closes the curtains, Ezra becomes nasty and barks orders at his assistant Clyde. When he tries to shoo Bobby away, Bobby announces he has been sent to live with him since his parents (Ezra's sister and brother in law) died in a car accident. While Ezra doesn't want the responsibility, he warms up to the idea after realizing Bobby can help him around the home ''for free''. Bobby is given the attic for a room and a hard stretcher for a bed. 

Ezra begins to teach Bobby the ways of managing the funeral business, starting with how to take care of the corpses. After originally being grossed out with the process of draining blood, Bobby learns Ezra cuts cost by filling the bodies with tap water instead of embalming fluid. He also spots several of his uncle's other extreme penny-pinching habits, such as hoarding gold teeth and overselling pine caskets. Ezra constantly quotes the Bible to justify his cheapness and belittles his nephew any chance he gets.  

One day,  Ezra mistakenly orders a pine casket for a client who specifically wanted oak for his deceased son. Furious that he will have to pay for another coffin, Ezra blames Bobby for the mishap and beats him with a crowbar. The poor boy is left with a severe spinal injury and must spend his life on crutches; Ezra lies to the doctor and tells him his nephew fell down the stairs.  

Some time later, Ezra sells Bobby's Air Jordan shoes to help pay his ballooning medical bills. Bobby, furious and fed up with his cruel uncle, threatens to tell the sheriff how he really got crippled. Realizing a use for the extra pine coffin, Ezra lures Bobby to the top of the basement stairs and throws his basketball at him -- causing the boy to fall down the stairs and snap his neck. A remorse-less Ezra drains his nephews blood and embalms him with tap water. Upon realizing Bobby's body is too tall for the coffin, Ezra uses an electric saw to cut both legs off at the ankle. Later on, attendees at Bobby's wake are suspicious of Bobby falling down the stairs a second time as well as his coffin size -- with one man saying ""such a short coffin for a boy so tall."" Clyde, knowing that Ezra was responsible for Bobby's death but can't prove it, quits and leaves a miserable Ezra to tend to his business alone. 

Late one night, Ezra wakes up to a knock on the door -- he answers it to find no one there. Tormented by a runny faucet and randomly turned on lights, Ezra thinks Clyde is attempting to scare him. Suddenly, Bobby's basketball bounces down the stairs and stops at Ezra's feet; after he picks it up, an Air Jordan-wearing foot kicks him down the stairs. In an ironic twist, Ezra suffers a spinal injury from the fall and now cannot feel his legs. Bobby's legless zombie comes down the stairs aided by his crutches; he recites the Bible quote ""blood is thicker than water"" before beating his cowering uncle to death with a crowbar.

==Short Summary==
In an alternative 1969, two astronauts on a perilous high-tech space mission grapple with the fallout of an unfathomable tragedy back on Earth.

==Full Summary==
As [[David Ross]] is drawing a portrait of his two children, his daughter [[Lily Ross|Lily]] reaches up to scratch her nose. David tells her that if she has to do that, she should return to the same pose afterward. Lily questions why she even has to be there, because it's [[Ricky Ross|Ricky's]] birthday. David says Ricky is her brother. David's wife [[Jessica Ross|Jessica]] enters the room, and asks if they're ready to go. David tells the kids they can get up.

[[Cliff Stanfield]] is trying to chop wood, but he's having some difficulty. He tells his son [[Henry Stanfield|Henry]] that he's not used to his grip yet, and hits the wood again. Cliff brings the chopped wood into a room where his wife [[Lana Stanfield|Lana]] is reading a book. He says that Henry was wondering how long it will be until dinner. Lana resignedly says that she can start on it now.

David, Jessica, Lily, and Ricky watch Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in a movie theater. When David and Jessica lean toward each other and hold hands, [[Kyle]] and [[Sally]] notice and watch them. Outside the theater, Kyle and Sally stop David and his family as they're leaving. They recognize David and say it's an honor to meet him. Kyle shakes David's hand and is impressed by how ""real"" he is. Sally touches him as well and is similarly impressed. She asks if he's sleeping ""up there"" right now. David starts to explain, but Jessica interrupts by clearing her throat. As they walk away, Jessica says she knows that people are excited, but they can also be rude.

Cliff prays with his family as they sit down to eat, but Cliff's place setting is empty.

David's family gets back home. Lily and Ricky race to the door. Jessica stops and ponders a van parked across the street with all of the windows blocked by curtains. David kisses Lily and Ricky good night and tells them he loves them. Jessica pours drinks while David puts on a record. David pulls Jessica into him and they dance.

Cliff and Lana do dishes silently.

Things grow more intimate between Jessica and David. As Jessica recovers from an orgasm, David's watch beeps. He apologizes and says he has to go. He kisses her forehead before leaving.

Cliff is drying a cup when his watch beeps. He tells Lana he has to go.

Cliff and David each sit in reclined dentist chair-like devices, each in their respective homes and appear to fall asleep.

They both awaken in a contoured bed on a space station and stretch.

David tells Cliff the alarm was for a minor impact, likely just debris, but there's a crack in the solar coating. They set out to repair it. Cliff takes of his jewelry and David helps him get into his space suit. David closes the door and Cliff goes outside the station. David watches as Cliff works to fix the damage. 

Afterward, back inside the station, David helps Cliff remove the space suit. David asks Cliff how his new home is. Cliff says they're still settling in, but it's good. It's way out of the city. Henry's a little quiet, but Cliff is sure he'll grow into it. David asks about Lana and Cliff says she's doing well. David is surprised because Lana seemed like a social butterfly when they met. Cliff says he thinks she likes it. David asks when their next physical is and Cliff says it's Friday. David says he'll see Cliff on Friday. They part ways.

David and Cliff lie back in their space beds. They appear to fall asleep and wake back up in the chairs back on Earth.

Cliff goes to his bedroom, where Lana is reading. She wants them to have a party for the local folks, so they can meet their neighbors; just something small. Cliff doesn't think so. Lana says it'll be good for Henry to meet some local kids. Cliff just says ""we'll see."" He climbs into bed and lies down while Lana continues reading.

David wakes to a clattering noise. He grabs a baseball bat and goes down to the living room, where he finds [[Kappa]], [[Theta]], [[Sigma]], and [[Epsilon]]. He tells them to get out of his house. They ignore him and Sigma asks if he has a penis. David doesn't answer, but threatens them with the bat if they don't leave. Sigma throws a bottle, which breaks against the wall, so David starts swinging the bat, but can't hit them as they move around and taunt him. They pin him down and Kappa cuts off his arm, revealing an electronic core. Kappa says he's nothing natural. The arm continues to move as Kappa drops it. Sigma hands Kappa a hammer and Kappa sends Theta to get David's family. Kappa hits David in the head with the hammer. Instantly, David wakes up on the station. He immediately activates the system to go back.

David wakes, hog-tied on the couch. He sees Jessica beg for her children's lives. One of their attackers just want to find out who else is machine, but Jessica says it's just David; he's the only one. Jessica shows that she's bleeding real blood. Kappa believes that she's real and that her kids are real, but it doesn't matter because he states that nothing that's happening in their home that she is fully knowledgeable is right in nature; David is sleeping in the sky while his mechanical image is walking around on Earth. Jessica shares her bed with him; Kappa says none of it is right. ""Defying nature must have a cost."" They have to kill her and her children while David watches. Kappa has Epsilon start the killing. Once they're dead, the cult members rub their blood on the floor. Then they pour gas on David and light him on fire.

Cliff wakes up to the phone ringing. He gets up to answer it and learns what happened to David's family and his replica body.

Cliff wakes up on the station. He gets up and searches for David. He finds him, crying, in a room full of plants. David asks to be left alone. Cliff expresses his condolences, but David just yells at him to get out.

Lana reads a newspaper article about David's family being murdered and that the gang turned-themselves in to be arrested; ""They're some kind of hippie cult."" Cliff comes in and tells her that David told him to get out. He spoke to Ground Control and they told him to leave David alone, as he'll be in shock. The Board says they can have protection if they feel like they need it, but they're a long way from California. Lana keeps thinking about Jessica and the kids. She can't even imagine. Cliff says they even destroyed his replica by setting it on fire. While Cliff is down on Earth, David is alone in space. They have four years left of their six-year mission. Lana asks if they can make him another replica suit, but it's not possible. Even if they could, David doesn't have anything left on Earth.

On the station, David and Cliff work out and perform their routine maintenance tasks.

On Earth, Cliff reads in the paper that David's family's funeral is that day alongside an article in which Kappa claims they were protecting the natural order.

In the space station, David watches a grainy video feed of his family's funeral as a pastor reads Psalm 23. Later, he eats his unappetizing rations alone and sits around the station.

Cliff teaches Henry to make a spear. He then shows Henry how to spear fish in a stream. Once Cliff has gotten one, it's Henry's turn, but Cliff gets an alarm called back for a serious airlock issue.

On the station, Cliff finds David in the airlock. After David won't respond to Cliff's pounding and yelling, Cliff opens the door. A nearly-catatonic David claims he's okay and that he's just checking things.

Lana asks if he thinks David was preparing to throw himself out. Cliff isn't sure, but if David were to do something like that, Cliff would still be up there. The ship relies on a two-man crew. If something goes wrong, they would both be dead. They have to come up with some solution. David is lost and Cliff needs to reach him, but doesn't know how. Lana suggests letting David use his link, just for long enough that David can take a walk in the woods and feel the breeze on his face. Cliff worries that it'll be strange for her and Henry. She says Henry doesn't need to know. Cliff's not sure that David would even want that. She suggests that he offer.

Cliff starts routine checks on the station. David slowly helps him. As they work, Cliff offers David use of his replica to visit Earth for a while. David says he thinks he'd like that.

Lana asks how she should speak to David. Cliff says David used to be talkative, but he's not easy to read anymore. He suggests just letting him reconnect to earth by taking in the air.

Cliff goes to the link to allow David to use it. Cliff asks if David is ready. David lies down in Cliff's bed and Cliff puts in his card, allowing David to go to sleep and wake up on Earth. David wakes up in Cliff's replica. He touches his face and then gets up to walk around. Outside, Lana greets him. He stumbles as he goes down the stairs and Lana says Cliff said it might take some getting used to. She asks if he'd liked to see the forest. He says yes.

Lana and David walk through the trees. David touches the leaves as they walk past. Lana takes him to her favorite spot and they sit down together. David forgot what if feels like to be on Earth. He picks up a caterpillar and lets it crawl on his hand. He starts to cry as he puts it back down and Lana comforts him.

As they walk back to the house, David frames it with his fingers. He says it's quite the home.

Henry watches them through the window.

On the station, Cliff kills time until David gets back. David thanks him and tells him his home is beautiful. It's time for Cliff to go, so David says he'll see him on Friday. Cliff lies down and goes to Earth.

David takes a sketchpad and starts drawing.

Lana is surprised when Cliff appears. Cliff thinks it worked because David seems lighter now. He asks how it was. Lana says David cried, which surprises Cliff. When asked how she responded, she says she didn't do much because she didn't know what to say.

David and Cliff go through their tasks on the station. David asks to show Cliff something. Cliff is impressed with a pencil drawing of his earth house, in great detail, from memory. He says when something's vivid, he just sees it. Cliff says if he had that picture on Earth, he'd hang it on the wall. David offers to go back down to Earth and paint another one, but with oil paints, as a thank you gift. He's not sure Cliff would want to do that, but drawing helps and he'd love to be able to paint again. Cliff asks how long it would take. David says it would take a while. He backs up. He understands that it's not fair to ask. Cliff asks for time to think it over.

Cliff tells Lana it would be just an hour, once a week, while he's doing his physical. David can set his things up in the barn. He'll get them a list of things he'll need. He's clearly been thinking about it. He asks Lana what she thinks.

Cliff sends David back to Earth. Lana asks if David has everything he needs. She thinks she got the whole list. He says it looks like it and thanks her. He asks her about the book she's reading. She thinks it's fine, but it's a bit trashy. He offers to recommend some other books to her. As she leaves, David puts on a music album and starts painting.

On the station, Cliff does his physical. When David returns, he and Cliff shake hands and trade places.

Henry politely asks to be excused from the table. He goes outside.

As David continues his painting, Lana watches him work.

Cliff exercises on the station.

David asks Lana if she's done much painting and she says not since kindergarten. He offers her the brush. She's worried about making a mess, but he says if she does, he'll just paint over it. He guides her through it. She leaves when Henry calls for her.

David trades places with Cliff again and he comments that David's painting looks good. David draws Lana.

While painting, David stops and wipes his hands. David asks Lana if she has any linseed oil because he's run out. Lana checks, but can't find anything. He asks if there's a hardware store in town and if Cliff will mind that they borrowed his car.

David and Lana drive to the hardware store. Initially David is waiting in the car, but gets out. When Lana returns to the car with the linseed oil, he asks if she wants to come so he can check out the bookstore. They go to the bookstore together.

David finds a book and tells Lana he thinks she'll like it. While they buy it, the bookshop clerk asks if he's Cliff Stanfield. He says he is. She's impressed by his replica. She heard they moved in to the old Watson place and asks how they like it. It's a great place for a family. She was sorry to hear what happened to David and asks how he's doing. David says he's holding up. Lana says they need to get going and the clerk says it was nice to meet him. Back in the car, Lana comforts David.

Cliff waits for David to return. When he finally wakes up, David thanks him again and Cliff takes his place. David continues drawing Lana.

Lana is reading her new book. She pauses and runs her finger down the spine.

Lana reads while David paints nearby. He asks her to take a look. She's flattered that he added her to the painting, standing on the porch. David puts on a record and pulls Lana in for a dance. He pulls her in close and presses his face to her neck. Then he runs his hands down her body like he did with Jessica. After a moment, she breaks away and leaves.

Henry watches as David calls out to Lana.

David finds Lana in the kitchen and tells her it's okay. She thinks she's given him the wrong idea. David promises that Cliff won't know. Lana brushes him off, even as he insists that she wants it. She yells at him for manipulating her. She reminds him that this isn't his home, and he isn't her husband. He's a guest. He says that she wants it, but she says he doesn't know her. David leaves.

In the barn, someone has streaked paint across the canvas. David turns and sees Henry with paint on his hand.

Lana hears Henry run through the house and calls to him.

David works to fix the painting. Lana comes to the barn and tells him he should go.

David comes back and Cliff asks if everything's okay. David curtly says it's fine.

Lana tells Cliff that David hit Henry for ruining the painting. They argue over it because Henry thinks the person who hit him was his dad. Cliff says he's knocked Henry on the side of the head a hundred times. Henry can be a terror. He needs someone to keep him in line. Cliff says David wants to finish the painting. He wants to let David finish the painting. It'll be two more visits tops. Then he'll come up with some excuse.

Cliff exercises on the station.

David tries to talk to Lana, but she just tells him his things are set up in the barn and she's taking Henry to the pool. David goes out to the barn.

Cliff goes to do his physical, but the equipment doesn't work.

David works on fixing the painting.

As Cliff wanders around the station, he goes into David's space and finds drawings of his family on the walls. Then he looks through a pile of drawings and finds several of Lana, including some of her nude.

David has fixed the painting. His watch beeps.

David says he got an alert and asks Cliff what's up. Cliff holds up the drawings and asks David to explain. David says it's just a drawing, like a fantasy. Cliff pushes David against the wall and says Lana's his wife. David tries to defend himself, but Cliff punches him. David says he has nothing. Cliff has no idea what it's like to be him. Everything he had is gone, destroyed. Cliff has it all and he doesn't even care. Cliff says ""I care plenty."" David says Lana is lonely. She's all alone and unappreciated. Cliff tells him to shut up and pushes him back up against the wall. David says he doesn't know what he has, but Cliff says he does.

Henry asks Lana how much longer they have to sit in the car. Lana says until his father's home. She starts the car and drives away. They get home and Cliff sends Henry inside. In the barn, Cliff destroys the painting. He confronts Lana and demands that she tell him what's going on between her and David. She says nothing and denies posing for him. He still thinks something happened because David drew her naked; he draws from memory. Lana says he's seen nothing. Cliff continues asking, but Lana swears on her life and Henry's life that nothing happened. Cliff knows that David wanted it, and Lana says yes.

Cliff is outraged that she still let him come. She says that Cliff knew she didn't want him there, but Cliff says she never said that. She told him that David hit their son and Cliff didn't listen. Cliff says that David said he doesn't touch Lana. He wants to know how David knew that. Lana says she would never say that to anyone. She doesn't know how David knew that but admits to Cliff that she's lonely all the time, even when he's home. They came there for him. He brought them there for himself and now they all just walk from room to room. Cliff's just a shadow, but she's here and she's real. David didn't touch her, but she wished he did. For a moment, it felt like her husband was back and saw that she was real. She wants that and she wishes he still did too. Cliff hugs Lana and apologizes to her.

Cliff and David exercise. David offers his hand to shake Cliff's, but Cliff doesn't take it. David wants to apologize because he overstepped his mark, but he promises nothing happened with Lana. Cliff knows that and knows Lana wasn't interested. David knows Cliff doesn't want him using his link anymore, but he wants to apologize to Lana in person. At the very least, he wants to say goodbye. Cliff says that's not going to happen. Lana says his visits offend her. He offends her. The thought of him returning makes her want to vomit. He's the worst kind of con man and she doesn't want him anywhere near her. She's Cliff's for all time. David won't speak to her or see her ever again.

David shaves off his beard, which has grown since his family died.

Cliff is with his family.

At the station, David watches Cliff's sleeping form.

Cliff gets called back to the station for an emergency.

David tells Cliff that the coolant tubing took a hit a few minutes ago and now it's leaking.

David helps Cliff get ready to go fix the tubing. Then he closes the airlock door and Cliff exits the module.

When Cliff gets to the location, he finds no leak or damage. He asks if David's sure it was coolant four, but gets no response. He goes back to the airlock, but the outer door is shut and David doesn't answer as he calls for help. Finally, the door opens again and Cliff enters the station. David helps him get his suit off and Cliff asks where he was. David says he was in the bathroom. Cliff is astonished that he would take a bathroom break while he was outside and says that coolant four was fine. Cliff concludes that the system is sending out false reports and they need to report it because that's not acceptable. As Cliff takes back his personal items, he notices his tag is missing. David pulls it out of his pocket and hands it to Cliff. Cliff asks David what he did.

Cliff races to his bunk. He sends himself back to Earth.

Cliff wakes up to find his replica's hands covered in blood. He calls out for Lana as he walks through the house, where blood is streaked on the walls. He breaks down crying when he finds blood pooled on the floor.

David sits at a table in the station. Cliff comes in and David offers him a seat. They're both crying.
"
0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0," == Summary == === Teaser ===  During their off hours, [[Seven of Nine]] and [[Captain]] [[Kathryn Janeway|Janeway]] are on the [[holodeck]], playing a game of {{dis|Velocity|sport}}. The captain wins six out of ten rounds, frustrating the former [[Borg drone|drone]], who has far superior visual acuity and stamina. Seven believes that, due to her [[biology|biological]] enhancements, she should have been able to win every round. Janeway tells her that there's more to winning the game than stamina, including intuition. Seven, however, considers intuition a ""Human fallacy"". She asks the captain for a rematch as Janeway walks towards the exit. When the captain replies negatively, Seven claims that Janeway is tired and concerned that she will be defeated. The captain replies that she is tired but not concerned. When Seven orders the [[computer]] to begin another round, Janeway tells it to ignore Seven's command. The captain tells her that the game's over and leaves.  === Act One === :""''[[Captain's log]], [[stardate]] 51978.2. It's been five months since we received the encoded message from the Alpha Quadrant. We know that the transmission was from [[Starfleet Command]], but we still can't decrypt it. [[B'Elanna Torres|B'Elanna]] thinks it's a lost cause, that too much of the [[data stream]] has been destroyed, but I haven't given up. I keep hoping inspiration will strike&hellip; somehow.''""  At 0500, Janeway sits in the [[mess hall]], trying to decrypt the message they received from the [[Alpha Quadrant]] via the [[Hirogen communications network]]. [[Commander]] [[Chakotay]] enters and Janeway realizes she has been there all night. The commander reports that {{Lieutenant}} [[Tom Paris]] and [[Neelix]] contacted the {{USS|Voyager}} a short time ago and are preparing to leave a trading [[colony]]. According to Paris, he and Neelix managed to obtain such a large quantity of supplies that their [[shuttle]] will not be able to travel faster than half-[[impulse]]. He also included news that one of the [[alien]]s they met, [[Arturis]], was very helpful. Neelix wants to repay him by bringing him onboard ''Voyager'' and granting him passage to the next [[star system]]. Janeway gives him permission and continues to work on the decrypted message. Chakotay suggests that she enlist Seven's assistance and she agrees that Seven would probably have a few [[Borg]] algorithms that could help. However, since she and Seven have been butting heads more than usual recently, Janeway isn't sure it would do any good to ask. Chakotay comments that Seven has learned a lot from Captain Janeway since she was liberated from the Borg a year ago. He hypothesizes that Seven may simply feel that she has surpassed her mentor. Janeway seems uncertain whether that is the case and asks Chakotay to join her for a cup of [[coffee]].  Paris and Neelix return to ''Voyager'' from the trading colony and land their [[shuttlecraft]]. While Paris directs several [[officer]]s to unload the cargo, Chakotay, behind him, is puzzled by one of the items. Paris tells Chakotay that he does not know what it is and looks for Neelix.  In a corner, Neelix introduces Captain Janeway to their guest, Arturis. Neelix recalls that, while he was negotiating with a [[xenon-based lifeform]], the [[universal translator]] went offline and Arturis saved him from embarrassment by translating the alien's words. Once Neelix leaves to help Paris, Janeway welcomes Arturis aboard, eager to find him some [[quarters]]. While leaving the [[cargo bay]], Janeway confesses that she has never met anyone as adept at languages as Arturis, who reveals that he knows more than four thousand different [[language]]s. Janeway comments that she still struggles with basic [[Klingonese]]. Arturis remains modest and says that most [[species]] have natural abilities that others do not &ndash; some are born with superior strength. Others, like Janeway's crew, have great generosity of spirit. For another example, Arturis adds that where most people can only see chaos, his people see patterns. This gives Janeway an idea. She asks whether Arturis is equally adept at computational languages as he is at verbal communication. He replies that he finds neither harder than the other. Pleased by his response, Janeway asks Arturis if he would be willing to grant the ''Voyager'' crew another favor.  In [[astrometrics]], Janeway, Seven and Arturis review the data stream from Starfleet. Arturis agrees with the captain's theory that the transmission has been badly damaged. As Seven prepares the message so that Arturis can view it again, he learns that she was [[Borg]] and comments that she is more attractive than the average drone. Seven explains that she is no longer connected to the [[Borg Collective]]. Arturis notices the problem with the message and attempts to reconstruct the data. When Janeway asks Seven if she is familiar with Arturis' people, she replies that the Borg, who know the race as [[Species 116]], have not been able to [[assimilate]] them &ndash; yet. Arturis explains that his people don't feel anger towards the Borg Collective, they simply avoid it. Arturis notifies the captain that he has been able to restore most of the undamaged blocks of data. However, several degraded sections of the message are still unrecoverable. The transmission includes footage of [[Admiral]] {{dis|Hayes|Male Admiral}} and a [[Stellar cartography#United Federation of Planets, et al.|spatial grid]]. Janeway discovers that the grid is a map of a nearby sector, less than ten [[light year]]s away. Believing that Starfleet may be trying to direct ''Voyager'' to the area shown on the map, Janeway, Arturis and Seven exit astrometrics.   As ''Voyager'' continues at [[warp]] speed, the trio arrives on the [[bridge]]. At the [[helm]], Paris reports that the [[starship]] is approaching the designated coordinates. Janeway instructs him to pilot the ship at a lower velocity and orders [[Lieutenant Commander|Lt. Cmdr.]] [[Tuvok]] to scan the area. When he detects a ship, Janeway orders him to show it on the main [[viewscreen]]. Although Tuvok states that he may be mistaken, he reports that the vessel has a Starfleet [[warp signature]].  === Act Two === Tuvok attempts to hail the ship but there is no response. From her station, Seven informs Chakotay that her [[sensor]]s have detected no organic [[matter]] aboard the ship. The vessel is undamaged and all primary systems, including {{dis|life support|system}}, are online. [[Ensign]] [[Harry Kim]] seems puzzled by the fact that there are no crew onboard but Janeway has faith that an answer can be found in the transmission from Starfleet. When Arturis agrees to help her decode the rest of the message, Janeway orders Chakotay to lead an [[away team]] and secure the vessel. The commander asks Tuvok and Paris to join him. As they leave the bridge, Arturis reveals that he is surprised that Janeway doesn't seem more encouraged by the vessel's discovery. She explains that she has learned to be cautious as well as hopeful and adds that ''Voyager'' has previously been presented with other opportunities that didn't work out. However, this time, she is slightly more hopeful than cautious. Seven accompanies Janeway and Arturis as they leave the bridge.  Meanwhile, Chakotay, Paris and Tuvok [[transporter|transport]] aboard the other ship. Chakotay uses a [[tricorder]], while the other two officers carry [[phaser]]s. Tuvok and Paris agree that the vessel's bridge is impressive as the [[Vulcan]] examines a computer console. While Chakotay looks at a detailed schematic of the craft, he remarks that he has never seen another Starfleet ship designed similarly. From the console, Tuvok learns the ship's name is the {{USS|Dauntless|NX-01-A}}, [[registry number|registry]] [[NX]]-01A. He also discovers that it was launched on [[stardate]] 51472. Chakotay notes that the ship has traveled 60,000 light years in just three months. Meanwhile, Paris finds that the [[helm]] station was set for auto-navigation, leading to the conclusion that the ship probably never had a crew. When the ship experiences small vibrations, Paris reports that the [[warp core]] is fluctuating and adds that he is not familiar with the design of the engine. The ship shudders more violently as he and the other officers head to [[Engineering]].  There, they find the ''Dauntless''{{'}}s [[warp core]]. Although Paris determines that the ship does not use [[antimatter]], he cannot confirm what [[element]] it uses for propulsion. Reading from a console, he learns that the ship has a [[quantum slipstream drive]]. However, neither of the other officers has heard of that form of [[technology]] before. Just then, the ship suddenly powers up and its auto-pilot system comes online.  On ''Voyager''{{'}}s bridge, Kim contacts Janeway telling her the ''Dauntless'' is moving away at high [[impulse]] speed and the away team are not responding to [[hail]]s. She orders him to initiate a pursuit course.  Aboard the ''Dauntless'', Paris is unable to deactivate the slipstream drive. Chakotay instructs the ship's computer to disable the vessel's propulsion but the computer does not comply with his vocal commands. Working at a console, Paris advises Tuvok and Chakotay to brace themselves. Suddenly, the craft leaps into motion, creating a slipstream in space. On ''Voyager''{{'}}s bridge, Kim informs Janeway that the ''Dauntless'' has disappeared from sight.  Meanwhile, Paris discovers that energy from the propulsion drive is being routed through the main [[navigational deflector]], creating the slipstream. Using the helm controls, he attempts to stop the flow of energy. His efforts are successful and the craft slows down to impulse. Tuvok determines that ''Voyager'' is out of scanning range and that the ''Dauntless'' has traveled over fifteen light years in just a few minutes.  :""''Captain's log, supplemental. After two days at high warp, we've rendezvoused with the ''Dauntless''. Arturis has helped us reconstruct most of the Starfleet message. The pieces of this puzzle are finally coming together.''""   Standing in the [[briefing room]], the [[senior staff]] watch a visual recording of Admiral Hayes. The admiral explains that while slipstream technology is still experimental, he believes it is safe and encourages the crew to use the ''Dauntless'' to return home. After the message ends, Janeway asks [[The Doctor]] about any health risks. He replies that the away team suffered no ill effects, such as cell damage or physiological stress, and that long term effects are unlikely. {{Lieutenant}} [[B'Elanna Torres|Torres]] reports that although the ship's primary systems are similar to ''Voyager''{{'}}s, it has only one [[transporter]] and no [[replicator]]s, [[holodeck]]s or shuttlecraft. The crew seems ready and willing to use the vessel but Seven points out that returning to [[Earth]] aboard the ''Dauntless'' would mean abandoning ''Voyager''. Chakotay asks Paris if the crew could incorporate the slipstream technology into ''Voyager''. When Paris answers that the plan is theoretically plausible, the captain tells him to try making the necessary modifications, so that they can bring the ship with them if possible. She also orders Torres and Kim to accompany an engineering team aboard the ''Dauntless'' and learn how to shut down the vessel's propulsion in a moment's notice. The captain plans subsequent test flights and instructs the senior staff to make sure that all of ''Voyager''{{'}}s crew becomes accustomed to the ''Dauntless''. She dismisses the officers but indicates to Tuvok that she wants him to stay. When she confides in him that the events of the past few days seem a little too convenient, Tuvok agrees. Janeway says she felt something was wrong since the moment Arturis came onboard but she couldn't put her finger on what exactly. The captain decides to proceed as planned but tells Tuvok to conduct surveillance on Arturis and research his past.  === Act Three === Janeway and Seven make their individual [[log entry|log entries]], in which they express their hopes and fears about returning to Earth.  :""''Captain's log, supplemental. So far, the crew hasn't found any evidence to support my doubts about Arturis. Nevertheless, I've told them to keep looking, and to keep their optimism in check. But that's one order I don't expect them to follow to the letter. Despite my apprehension, I can't help but wonder what I'll be doing in three months' time. Still guiding ''Voyager'' through the [[Delta Quadrant]], searching for a way home, or looking up old friends in [[Indiana]]?''""  :""''Daily log, Seven of Nine, stardate 51981.6. I've analyzed the quantum slipstream technology of the ''Dauntless''. It is similar to the [[transwarp drive]] used by the Borg. As a result, my expertise will be crucial to the mission's success. ''Voyager''{{'}}s crew is counting on that success. But I find myself ambivalent, so I'm carrying out my assignment, nothing more. If we do return to [[Sol sector|Sector 001]], will I adapt to Human civilization? A single Borg among billions of individuals.''""  Seven, Kim and Torres work together in engineering aboard the ''Dauntless'' and are eventually successful in learning how to drop out of slipstream warp. Kim is excited that the discovery signifies the crew are almost home. Torres seems to share Kim's enthusiasm but Seven remains neutral.  Kim leaves to run a [[metallurgical analysis]] of a [[bulkhead]], while Seven and Torres discuss the prospect of returning to the Alpha Quadrant. Seven is puzzled as to why Torres is eager to return home when, as a former [[Maquis]], she is likely to face nothing but adversity. However, Torres tells the former drone that she would rather deal with the consequences of her past than spend the rest of her life in the [[Delta Quadrant]]. She then tells Seven that being an ex-Borg, she is likely to face even more adversity than Torres and jokes that they will be outcasts together. Seven is not amused and Torres tells her to work on her sense of humor, as it will help her to make friends on Earth.  Kim calls out to Seven from under the gantry where he is studying his [[tricorder]]. He tells Seven there is an anomalous surge of energy emanating from behind a panel but Seven replies that there are no power conduits running through that section. Kim tries to make conversation with Seven, assuring her that she will enjoy Earth, a biologically diverse planet. Seven still seems unimpressed, so he states that there are several other planets to choose from if she finds Earth unpleasant. When Seven notifies Kim that she is going to speak with the captain, Kim senses that she intends to leave the crew of ''Voyager''. He tells her that the crew's return to the Alpha Quadrant won't be the same without her, which elicits a small smile. Kim's attention returns to his work and he opens the panel where the energy readings were coming from. Smoke rises from the technology beneath the panel as it suddenly flashes. Standing back, Kim becomes puzzled by his tricorder readings. Then the portion of the [[bulkhead]] he is studying shimmers and very briefly reveals alien technology. Confused by his experience, Kim contacts Tuvok and reports that he has found something unusual on the ''Dauntless''. Aboard ''Voyager'', Tuvok replies that he is on his way.  In astrometrics, Janeway observes a display of Earth, focusing primarily on the [[North America]]n [[continent]]. Seven enters and finds the captain trying to reconstruct the last fragment of the data stream, which Arturis said was too badly damaged. Although Janeway feels that he gave up too easily, Seven dismisses the captain's belief as ""intuition"". Janeway tells Seven that she has designed a new encryption algorithm, which she begins to test on the message. While she works however, Seven tells the captain that she does not intend to return to the Alpha Quadrant with the ''Voyager'' crew. Janeway abruptly stops working on the message.  The captain turns to Seven and says she understands how the prospect of being among billions of Humans must be overwhelming for the former drone, but she is a member of the Human species, and Earth is her home. When Janeway reminds Seven of how much she has achieved in the last nine months and urges her to continue her development from Borg back to Human, Seven becomes defensive. Although Janeway attempted to influence Seven to become more like herself, the former drone claims that the captain has ultimately failed. Seven says that their frequent disagreements are an indication that she does not share Janeway's values. She believes that Janeway's drive to explore space is inefficient, that her need for family connections is a weakness and that her infatuation with Earth is irrational.  When Janeway tells Seven that the crew needs her expertise on their hazardous mission to the Alpha Quadrant, Seven replies that her participation is irrelevant to the crew's survival. The captain disagrees, believing that Seven owes a debt to the crew that should be repaid. However, Seven retorts that she has returned the crew's favor on many occasions and that for once, she refuses. When she tells Janeway that she doesn't know what she will do in the Delta Quadrant, the captain insists that the crew won't abandon her there. Then Janeway realizes Seven's real problem &ndash; her fear of returning to Earth.  The discussion is interrupted by an audio signal from a computer console. Janeway discovers that the new algorithm she developed has worked. Initially, the captain is confused when the image of Admiral Hayes appears since the crew had apparently decrypted that section of the message. Seven suggests it may be an addendum, but Janeway knows that she has recovered a completely different message. Clearing up distortion in the recording's audio, Janeway is able to hear as Hayes delivers a completely different message than before; he apologises stating that despite Starfleet's best attempts, they have been unable to find a way to bring ''Voyager ''back to the Alpha Quadrant. The rest of the data stream consists of all the information Starfleet could provide on the Delta Quadrant which Starfleet hopes the crew can use to possibly shave a few years off their journey, but other than that can provide nothing else.  As the captain hangs her head in disappointment, understanding that the ''Dauntless'' is not a Starfleet vessel, Seven comments that her intuition was correct. Anger quickly replaces Janeway's disillusionment when she realizes that Arturis has been lying to them since he came onboard. She hails Tuvok, who is on the ''Dauntless'' and notifies him that her suspicions concerning Arturis have been confirmed.  While she walks through a corridor with Seven, Janeway elaborates that Arturis tampered with the data stream and that the ''Dauntless'' is not a Starfleet ship. Tuvok concurs with the captain and informs her that he and Ensign Kim discovered concealed alien technology in main engineering aboard the ''Dauntless''. When Tuvok tells Janeway that Arturis is working with Torres on the bridge, the captain orders him to go there and wait for a [[security team]] to arrive. Janeway and Seven continue to walk through the corridor and arm themselves with phasers.  === Act Four === Meanwhile, Arturis surveys the bridge of the ''Dauntless''. As he walks over to the helm station, Torres notices and stops him from activating the slipstream drive. Arturis behaves as if he didn't mean to engage the drive and apologizes in Klingonese. When he notices that Torres is surprised, he explains that he didn't know the language until Janeway let him review ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[linguistic database]]. Tuvok enters the bridge and a few seconds later, Janeway, Seven and a security team beam aboard near his position, each carrying a phaser. Janeway orders Torres to evacuate the repair teams, then proceeds to accuse Arturis of fabricating the Starfleet message. Arturis denies the accusation and tries to blame Seven of tampering with the message. Janeway doesn't believe the alien and orders Tuvok to take him to ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[brig]]. A struggle ensues but Arturis manages to resist the security officers and pull a panel off the helm station. Although Janeway permits Tuvok to fire his phaser at the alien, the [[weapon]] seems to have little effect on him. Arturis flips a switch that replaces the image of Starfleet technology to its true alien form. He then erects a [[force field]] and tries to deflect ''Voyager''{{'}}s transporters.  On ''Voyager''{{'}}s bridge, Kim reports that he has managed to retrieve everyone but Janeway and Seven. When Paris calls out that the ''Dauntless'' is creating a slipstream, Chakotay orders Tom to pursue the ship. Meanwhile, Arturis is commanding the helm aboard the ''Dauntless''. The ship is trembling and its engines rumble as Janeway watches the main viewscreen. The vessel glows and distorts shortly before it accelerates to slipstream, vanishing from view of ''Voyager''.  Aboard ''Voyager'', Chakotay tells Paris to bring the warp core modifications on-line in order to pursue the alien craft. Paris responds that the adaptations to the core have not been properly tested yet but Chakotay believes that the starship's pursuit of the ''Dauntless'' will be a suitable test.  The appearance of the alien ship has stabilized to its earlier form as it races through a slipstream. On board, Seven wonders where Arturis means to take the ''Dauntless''. He answers simply, ""home"". Janeway asks whether the alien used [[hologram]]s to create the image of a Starfleet bridge, but Arturis replies that he maintained the illusion with [[particle synthesis]], a method beyond Starfleet's understanding. When the captain asks if the species that Arturis belongs to frequently preys on innocent ships, he answers that Janeway's use of the word ""innocent"" reflects her self-righteousness. Janeway tries a diplomatic approach to reasoning with Arturis, but the alien responds angrily and reveals that he blames Janeway for the assimilation of his species. He says that Janeway negotiated an agreement with the Borg: safe passage through their space in return for assistance for helping them defeat [[Species 8472]].  Arturis continues to explain that his people had outwitted the Borg for centuries. But recently, the Borg started to adapt better to their defenses and were about to break through. The [[Borg-Species 8472 War|Borg's war with Species 8472]] was their last hope of defeating the Collective. However, due to the brief [[alliance]] between ''Voyager'' and the Borg in [[2374]], the Collective defeated Species 8472. They subsequently deployed hundreds of [[Borg cube|Borg]] [[Borg cubes 011|cubes]] that destroyed the [[Species 116 sentry vessel|sentry ships]], outer colonies and eventually the [[homeworld]] of Arturis' people. One of the lucky few that managed to escape, Arturis left his homeworld alone on a vessel. He blames Janeway for his loss and believes that she, a stranger to the Delta Quadrant, had no right to decide whether the Borg or Species 8472 won their war.  Months after the annihilation of his species, Arturis found ''Voyager''. He secretly observed the starship, waiting for a chance to avenge the loss of his people. When Starfleet transmitted a data stream to ''Voyager'', Arturis knew that he could tamper with the message and lure the crew aboard the ''Dauntless''. He planned to then activate the vessel's slipstream drive and pilot the craft into Borg space, where the crew would be assimilated. Although he had hoped to trap the entire crew aboard the vessel, he is willing to settle for just Seven and Janeway. He tells them that in a matter of hours, the ''Dauntless'' will return to his homeworld inside Borg space. He believes his own assimilation is irrelevant and thinks that Seven should be grateful that he is helping her achieve her objective of returning to the Borg.  === Act Five === ]] In space, ''Voyager'' glows and distorts as it prepares to enter a slipstream. However, as the bridge of the starship trembles, Paris reports that the vessel is experiencing difficulty in achieving slipstream velocity. When the bridge shakes more frequently, Tuvok tells Chakotay that he is having trouble controlling the parameters of the [[quantum warp field]] and asks for more power to be routed to the deflector. Responding to the [[tactical officer]]'s request, Chakotay contacts engineering.  There, Lieutenant Torres replies that she is already working on the problem and tells an engineering officer to supply [[deflector control|Deflector Control]] with auxiliary power. The warp core pulses rapidly as B'Elanna orders another officer to make sure the quantum warp field is stable.  After the bridge shudders violently, Tuvok reports that the deflector is at maximum power and that he is focusing the quantum warp field. Ensign Kim adds that the hull temperature is at critical, shortly before the trembling ceases as ''Voyager'' enters a quantum slipstream. Harry informs Chakotay that [[structural integrity]] is weakened and that the [[hull]] will buckle in less than an hour. Paris aligns the ship's slipstream to directly behind the ''Dauntless'' and reports that ''Voyager'' is at maximum velocity.   In the [[brig]] of the alien ship, Janeway and Seven are unarmed and imprisoned behind a [[force field]], and quickly concoct a plan of escape. They realize that a typical Borg drone can easily pass through force fields. Seven explains that specific Borg [[nanoprobe]]s enact this ability by altering the drone's [[bioelectric field]], but detailed modification of her [[cranial implant]] is required to re-enable this function (disabled after the events of {{e|Scorpion}}). The captain disassembles her [[combadge]] and removes a [[microfilament]], the only device available accurate enough to tweak Seven's cranial implant. While Janeway makes the adjustments, she admits that she may be hard on Seven at times, but it was never out of anger or regret that she brought her aboard. Janeway says that as captain, she can't always be Seven's friend. Seven replies that she doesn't understand, but will understand perfectly when they are assimilated and their ""thoughts become one"", then quickly clarifies it as a joke. Seven confesses that she was indeed afraid of visiting Earth. She is no longer Borg but feels unsettled by the prospect of becoming [[Human]]. Seven is also unsure about remaining aboard ''Voyager'' and considers fending for herself in the Delta Quadrant, but Janeway assures her that she belongs there. With the modifications to her cranial implant complete, Seven escapes the cell and walks to a nearby wall panel to disable the force field.  On the bridge, Arturis discovers that Seven is attempting to shut down the force field, and attempts to counter using another console, but is unsuccessful. Seven facilitates Janeway's escape and both travel to the engine room, where the captain plans on shutting down the slipstream drive.  The ''Dauntless'' continues to fly through a quantum slipstream as Janeway and Seven arrive in engineering. When Seven tries to initiate the shutdown procedure, the captain realizes that Arturis is blocking their commands from the bridge. The room shakes as the vessel accelerates. Seven explains that the ''Dauntless'' has increased velocity and will reach Borg space in less than twelve minutes. Janeway tells her to send a power surge to the starboard [[thruster]]s and attempt to turn the ship in the wrong direction, as a distraction and to change course. Before she goes to the bridge to confront Arturis and as added motivation for survival, Janeway tells Seven that she has scheduled a game of Velocity with her the following day in [[Holodeck]] 1.  The ''Dauntless'' turns sharply, throwing Arturis to the floor. However, he manages to regain control of the ship and keep it from exiting the slipstream. When Captain Janeway arrives on the bridge, he tells her that she will become a drone in only four minutes. The ship rocks to the side again and Janeway explains that Seven has gained access to the ''Dauntless''{{'}}s navigational systems. The captain attempts to reason with Arturis, but the alien claims that the only thing he can understand or feel is revenge. Janeway insists that Arturis can carry on the legacy of his people, that their accomplishments, knowledge and dignity can survive in him. She urges him to end his pursuit of revenge. Arturis takes a moment to contemplate Janeway's words, then taps a control on the helm station.  In the engine room, Seven is working at a console when it suddenly crackles with energy. She recoils when the panel explodes in a shower of sparks, smoke pouring from the station.   On the bridge, Arturis informs the captain that he has destroyed the navigational controls so that no-one can stop the ship, not even he. Janeway becomes anxious and Arturis tells her that the ''Dauntless'' will arrive in Borg space in two minutes. Suddenly, however, Arturis and Janeway stumble as the vessel jolts.  ]] ''Voyager'' has reached the ''Dauntless'' and is firing [[photon torpedo]]es, attacking the enemy ship. On the bridge of the Starfleet craft, Tuvok reports that the other vessel is defenseless, as its [[shields]] are down. Chakotay orders Kim to get a [[Transporter faster-than-warp|transporter lock]] on Janeway and Seven.  Meanwhile, the helm station aboard the ''Dauntless'' explodes. Arturis realizes that ''Voyager'' is in the vicinity. As her [[atom]]s begin to scatter, Janeway asks Arturis to join her. The alien refuses and fires a hand-weapon at the captain as she beams off the ship.   Aboard ''Voyager'', Harry Kim notifies Chakotay that both Seven and Janeway are now in Transporter Room 2, returned safely to the Starfleet ship. The commander instructs Paris to change the starship's heading to travel in the direction they came. Tom complies and sets to work. In slipstream, ''Voyager'' branches off and moves away from the ''Dauntless'', which eventually drops out of slipstream to impulse, surrounded by Borg cubes.   Arturis listens as the Collective welcomes him with a standard Borg greeting &ndash; ""''We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.''"" In his [[command chair]] on the bridge, Arturis braces himself for the inevitable.  :""''Captain's log, supplemental. We remained in the quantum slipstream for an hour before it finally collapsed. Our diagnostics have concluded that we can't risk using this technology again, but we did manage to get three hundred light years closer to home.''""  In Holodeck 1, Janeway and Seven play Velocity, which the captain consistently wins. Seven wants to leave early to continue her work in astrometrics, but Janeway replies that she has ordered the crew to rest during the next few days. Seven reveals that she is attempting to design a new method of traveling at slipstream without damaging the ship. Janeway is surprised, since Seven has been so intent recently on staying in the Delta Quadrant. The former drone tells the captain that as they approached Borg space, she re-evaluated her future and found that becoming a drone again was unappealing. Janeway tells her it sounds like she's starting to embrace her Humanity. Seven denies this, but admits that nothing is impossible. The captain smiles and tells the computer, ""''One more game.''"" She and Seven take their starting places and, as the velocity disc races through the air, Seven fires her phaser.  "

== Synopsis ==
A frustrated bachelor makes a telepathic connection with a complete stranger, only to fall in love with her and learn she may not be the person he thinks she is.

== Plot ==
=== Act I ===
Phil Hayes is on a date with Julia. While she tries to make small talk, Phil quickly becomes uninterested and makes an awkward comment about her hair. Suddenly he hears another woman's voice in his head. Without actually talking, they start sending thoughts to each other via a mental communication. Phil darts off to the bathroom and wonders if he is going crazy, but the voice insists she is real. Neither likes hearing the others' thoughts -- especially since they don't know each other — and they angrily agree to stop talking to each other. Phil looks in the bathroom mirror and questions his sanity.

=== Act II ===
A few days later, Phil anxiously sits through an appointment with his therapist. It becomes clear that Phil has become very shallow after years of failed love.  He discusses the voice in his head as well as the failed date; the therapist believes that the voice is a coping mechanism to help Phil get out of a date he knew would fail. She suggests he might be suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder. Suddenly the voice speaks to him out of boredom. They start ""talking"" as the therapist continues talking to Phil, unaware he is not listening. The voice tells Phil her therapist is just like his, and they laugh over how they treat them. Prompted by the voice, Phil abruptly leaves the session.

The two try to figure out more about this connection they share. Phil goes to a coffee shop and stares at a cute barista, where he learns the voice cannot see what he sees. They also realize they can start ""talking"" to each other by simply just thinking of the other person, which they both find romantic. She playfully talks Phil into asking the barista out, but he leaves after seeing her talk to another guy. He takes himself out for pizza later, but uses the time to bond more with the voice. He learns her name is Annie Mitchell and that she lives in Diamond Falls, which is ""hundreds of miles"" from Phil's hometown Ashford City. The two are delighted with their new sense of intimacy. Over the next few weeks, they spend a lot of time ""talking"" and getting to know one another. Phil enjoys his time with Annie despite not being able to see or be with her; however, he appears to everyone around him as a strange guy laughing and talking to himself.

Annie politely asks Phil not to look her up online. While he respects this at first, he eventually caves after she awkwardly says no to them meeting in real life. He finds her Facebook and learns she is married. She admits to being in an unhappy marriage and that her recent connection with Phil helps her escape that. They have a meaningful conversation where Phil wonders his purpose in life and Annie cites their connection as an example of how special Phil is. She assures him he does have a purpose; they fall asleep longing to touch each other. The next morning, however, Annie abruptly tells Phil they have gotten too close and cannot talk anymore because ""it's too dangerous"". She stops speaking, leaving an upset Phil in awkward silence.  

=== Act III ===
Over the next few weeks, Phil becomes unhinged and walks through life miserable. He stops paying his bills, instead spending his time begging Annie to answer him so he at least knows she was real. When she doesn‘t respond, he moves on with his life and asks another girl out — which goes just as poorly as the first date. Annie suddenly ""talks"" to him; he jumps out of his seat when he hears her voice. She excitedly tells Phil she wants to leave her husband and be with him, which gets Phil to scream out in joy (despite looking crazy to everyone around him). Annie tells him to meet in Hillson Bay, a town between Diamond Falls and Ashford.

An ecstatic Phil cleans himself up and boards a train to Hillson Bay with flowers in his hands. They spend most of the ride bonding and anticipating their first meet; their happiness is cut short when Annie tells Phil someone on her train is following her. Phil tries to comfort her by saying he's with her, but she fearfully replies ""No. You‘re not."" She gets off at the Kingswood Station but is eventually taken by the man, causing her to scream and Phil to have a panic attack on the train. He is calmed down by the conductor, but waits in agony as the train gets to Kingswood. When he arrives, he follows clues she gave him but only finds her broken glasses in the street. Annie ""talks"" to Phil once more and tells him the man took her into the woods next to an owl. Phil follows the owl's hoot deep in the woods and finds a cabin. He knocks and asks the man home if he is hiding anything in there. The man becomes hostile and tells Phil to leave; Annie quickly confirms to Phil this is the same man who took her. He attacks the man and demands to know where Annie is; he pushes him to the ground and brutally beats him to death with a candlestick. The man's daughter walks in, followed by Annie — the two are horrified at the discovery. Phil, covered in blood, tries to embrace Annie. She swears not to know who he is and threatens him with a meat cleaver. The cops enter and arrest a confused Phil as Annie tells them that he just killed her husband!

Phil sits handcuffed in the back of a squad car and finally starts to believe he has been hearing voices. He sadistically realizes he drove halfway across the country to kill a random person....then suddenly he hears Annie's voice again. Admitting their mental connection to be real, Annie reveals she needed someone to free her from her unhappy marriage and has been manipulating Phil the whole time. He angrily calls her a monster, but she insists that all she did was install a purpose In him. The squad car drives off with a furious Phil squirming and yelling. Jordan Peele (The Narrator) views them from the crime scene as the episode ends.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"==Summary== ===Teaser===  The {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-D|-D}} is in pursuit of a [[Ferengi]] [[Tarr's Marauder|vessel]] suspected of stealing a [[Federation]]-owned [[T-9 energy converter]] from [[Gamma Tauri IV]]. The mission is also a long-awaited opportunity to encounter the Ferengi, who have never established visual contact with the Federation. The pursuit ends when the Ferengi ship gets close to a [[planet]] in the [[Delphi Ardu system]] and goes to sub-warp speed, possibly suffering a power surge and damage to their engines. After a while, it opens fire on the ''Enterprise'', causing her minimal damage. [[Captain]] [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] chooses not to return fire, arguing that the Ferengi are just reacting to the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s pursuit. Soon after, however, the ''Enterprise'' also suffers a power system failure, becoming immobilized with [[phaser]]s and [[shields]] off-line.  ===Act One===  The crew members believe their ship is trapped by the Ferengi. In the attempt to understand more of their adversaries, [[Data]] summarizes what is known about them: they are traders, and value [[profit]] above all, not unlike [[Yankee]] traders of [[18th century|18th]] and [[19th century]] [[North America]]. In [[engineering]], [[William T. Riker|Riker]] and [[Geordi La Forge|La Forge]] envisage a way to escape the trap, by jumping abruptly to maximum warp and taking advantage of the relatively slower reaction of the [[force field]]. To catch the Ferengi off guard, Picard hails them, asking for the restitution of the stolen equipment, but receives no answer. The ''Enterprise'' then attempts the warp jump, but the plan is not successful. Furthermore, the computer data banks are being accessed by some unknown external source. [[Counselor]] [[Deanna Troi|Troi]] points out that all the attention has been devoted to the Ferengi, neglecting the possible role of the planet.   A conference is held in the [[observation lounge]] among the senior officers, and, after discarding the hypothesis of fighting, they decide to try contacting the Ferengi again. After everyone leaves, Picard asks Riker to stay in the conference lounge for a moment. Picard notes that his [[first officer]] had not offered up an assessment. Riker believes that the senior staff had covered all available alternatives, unless Picard has another option he would like analyzed. Picard tells Riker that there is one left that needs no conversation and one they must avoid. Returning to the bridge, Picard hails the Ferengi, reluctantly asking to present their terms.  ===Act Two=== After a moment, the Ferengi [[DaiMon]] [[Tarr]] replies. Much to the astonishment of the ''Enterprise'' bridge crew, he says that he is ready to discuss surrender, but not unconditional surrender: he will return the energy converter and offer the lives of the second officers. It is now clear that both ships are trapped, and that the Ferengi are not the actual source of the energy field.   The ''Enterprise'' [[senior officer]]s convene again in the observation lounge. There, Data explains what is known about the mysterious planet, but not before becoming stuck with a [[Chinese finger puzzle]] left in the room by a couple of children, {{dis|Matthew|Enterprise-D}} and [[Pola]]. Thanks to the help of Picard, Data gets his fingers released and explains that the planet might be one of the most distant outposts of the [[Tkon Empire]], an ancient and powerful space {{dis|federation|government}} that existed over [[Half a million years ago|six hundred thousand years in the past]] and was now extinct due to their star going [[supernova]]. During the meeting, a [[probe]] launched from the ''Enterprise'' transmits its information, revealing that indeed both ships are trapped in a force field emanating from the planet's surface. Picard thinks that they should investigate with an [[away team]] sent to the surface and perhaps team up with the Ferengi. As Picard, Riker, Data, and La Forge leave the lounge, La Forge tosses the finger trap to Data, who catches it.  ===Act Three===  Picard again contacts the Ferengi, who have also discovered the true nature of the trap. After some confrontation with DaiMon Tarr over his deception, Picard suggests exchanging information in order to solve the common problem, which is endangering both ships. They each decide to send a joint [[away team]] of Starfleet officers and Ferengi down to the surface. Despite the apparent risks, including a loss of communication and no way to beam back on board the ''Enterprise'', Riker, La Forge, Data, [[Worf]], and [[Natasha Yar|Yar]] beam to the planet.  On the surface, the ''Enterprise'' members are initially separated and try to rejoin. The planet surface is full of [[crystalline tree]] shapes and the sky is beset by [[thunder]] and [[lightning]]. Worf, Riker, Data, and La Forge are attacked by the Ferengi away team armed with [[energy whip]]s, rendering them unconscious.  ===Act Four===  On the ''Enterprise'', the situation is getting critical, as {{dis|life support|system}} is failing. All [[energy]] is diverted to the family decks to extend their survival. It is getting colder and very dark. Picard and [[Beverly Crusher]] discuss whether she should give a sedative to her son, [[Wesley Crusher|Wesley]], or if he should keep awake waiting for death. Picard thinks Wesley has the right to greet death while awake, which Crusher considers to be a simple male perspective.   The Ferengi on the planet have the ''Enterprise'' away team's weapons, and examine Riker's [[combadge]], wondering whether it is [[gold]], while the crew gradually recover their senses, and they begin to argue. With an acute sense of hearing, the Ferengi are disturbed by the planetary thunderclaps. Taking advantage, Worf attacks, and the resulting fight is resolved when Yar intervenes with a [[phaser]]. The Ferengi show their surprise for the way Humans work together with their females and keep them clothed.   Suddenly, a mysterious figure materializes and is very loud, sending the acutely hearing Ferengi trio into agony.  ===Act Five===  The newly-arrived entity declares himself as [[Portal 63]], a guardian of the [[Tkon Empire]], and asks the away teams whether they want to enter the Empire. The aged guardian is then told by Riker and Data that the Tkon Empire does not exist any longer, and that several ages have passed. Portal 63 has been asleep for a very long time: hundreds of thousands of [[Earth]] years. The Ferengi try to strike a friendship with the Portal, asking for control of their ship, and promising to destroy the ''Enterprise'' and its crew. They describe the Humans as savages and [[barbarian]]s, and misrepresent Humanity by noting their non-interference with other civilizations as proof of being against legal trade. Also, their allowance of females to wear clothing as proof of their ""insanity"". The ''Enterprise'' team, however, accepts the Portal's trial, ready to prove their innocence.  Riker is challenged first. Riker is surprised that the Portal knows his name (Portal 63 can read Riker's mind). The Portal guardian attacks him with his sharp, bladed spear and is impressed by the composure with which Riker faces his fate after the blade lands perilously close to his right [[ear]]. Riker replies that ""''Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy.''"" The Portal is pleased by Riker's thoughts, unlike those of the deceptive Ferengi. The Portal says to Riker that he wants to know more about [[Sun Tzu]] and [[Earth History]], as it is similar to that of the [[Tkon]]. Then at Riker's request, he immediately releases the ''Enterprise'', restoring its power just in time to let the crew recover from what looks like their slumber, but is their point of death.    The Portal explains to Riker that he would usually destroy both ships since they were fighting, but then he saw that they were curiously trying to cooperate. The Portal asks Riker if he wants him to destroy the Ferengi, but Riker asks him to release them, since they are similar to ancient Humans: they have much to learn, but they can grow. Portal 63 asks ""''What if they never learn, Riker?''"" Riker says his values, and that of the Federation, require them to face the possibility of the Ferengi learning how to destroy them. When Riker asks what the Portal will do now that his Empire is gone, Portal 63 says he will sleep until needed again and then disappears in a flash of lightning.  On board the ''Enterprise'', the energy converter has been regained. Picard congratulates the away team for the success of the mission. Riker, with a devilish grin, then asks him permission to beam aboard the Ferengi ship Data's box of the Chinese finger traps as a ""''thank you for all they tried to do''"". After Picard commands ""''Make it so''"", the two ships leave orbit but not before La Forge has his fingers caught in a finger trap, at which Data enters the course on the helm for him."
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"  ==Plot== During a noisy attack led by a space pirate, [[Bender]], trying to find some peace and quiet in the torpedo tube, is launched into interstellar space beyond the reach of [[Fry]] and [[Leela]]. As they were going top speed when they fired Bender, Bender was therefore going faster than the [[Planet Express Ship|ship's]] top speed, and thus is impossible to recover. After an asteroid crashes into him, a civilization of tiny humanoids, the [[Shrimpkin]]s, grows on Bender, and they begin worshiping him as a deity. At first, Bender enjoys his new-found status and has his followers brew what for them are vast quantities of ""Lordweiser"" beer. The tiny denizens living on him begin praying for rain, sun, and wealth: Bender attempts to heed their prayers, failing comically and harming the Shrimpkins in the process. Eventually, the Shrimpkins who migrated to his backside feel their prayers are unheeded and become atheists. The micro-civilization is ultimately and simultaneously destroyed when the front and back-side factions fire atomic weapons constructed out of Bender's nuclear pile.   Bender soon floats toward a cosmic entity who can signal in binary. It behaves somewhat like a sophisticated cosmic computer resembling a galaxy with colored stars, who is ""user friendly...my good chum"". The [[God Entity]] is nearly omniscient: when Bender mentions his experiences with the Shrimpkins, the God Entity responds, in an encouraging tone, ""Yes, I saw... you were doing well until everyone died."" The God Entity advises that the use of deitylike powers requires a ""light touch"" so that those one intends to aid will neither lose hope nor become dependent on supernatural intervention.  During Bender's encounter with the God Entity, Fry and Leela search for a way to contact Bender. His odor couldn't be detected by the [[Smell-O-Scope]] and everyone tries to tell Fry to get over Bender, even bringing in [[Helper]]. Fry refuses to give up, thinking that he could try something desperate and crazy. After getting no help with Father Changstein Al Gamal at the First Amalgamated Church, he learns from the [[Robot Gypsy]] of the [[Monks of T'shuva]], a sect of secretive monks who use a combination radio telescope/amplifying transmitter to search for God in space, and with which the monks hope to contact God so that they may ""utter unto him a short prayer"". With Leela reluctantly tagging along, Fry makes his way through the Himalayas and finds the monastery. However, the monks refuse to delay their search for God to allow Fry to search for Bender. When Fry demands that he use the telescope, the monks react and put up martial arts stances. Leela stands up in Fry's defense, only for the monks to admit that their practise of martial arts is purely for meditation and they are pacifists. Leela then directs them into the laundry room. Fry spends the next three days searching for Bender, while the imprisoned monks eat their own shoes for sustenance. Fry gives up the search for Bender and hits the telescope controls, which happen to aim the telescope at the God Entity, who hears Fry say, ""I wish I had Bender back"". The entity then throws Bender all the way back to Earth, with a parachute and a peremptory farewell, just as Fry and Leela are leaving the monastery. After a sizzling embrace, Bender is convinced from his encounter that ""God"" does little to help people and insists on travelling back to the monastery to free the trapped monks. The God entity chuckles and repeats the advice he gave to Bender: ""When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.""    "
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"==Summary== ===Teaser=== ]] The {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701}} is in [[synchronous orbit]] over the capital city of {{dis|Gideon|planet}}, a candidate for [[Federation]] membership. This is itself unusual, as Gideon has repeatedly refused to establish diplomatic relations with the UFP before this. The [[physio-cultural report]]s the [[Gideon]]s have submitted to the Federation describe their [[planet]] as a virtual [[paradise]], with a [[bacteria|germ]]-free [[atmosphere]]. Yet for the duration of the delicate negotiations, [[Starfleet]] has agreed to the Gideons' unusual stipulation that no [[Sensor|surveillance]] scans be carried out upon their planet. [[Hodin]], the [[Gideon Council]]'s ''de facto'' [[ambassador]] to the Federation, accordingly provides the coordinates for the [[landing party]]'s [[transporter|beam-down]] &ndash; 875-020-079 &ndash; a spot he says is within the Council Chamber. Furthermore, the ''Enterprise'' landing party must comprise of only one particular individual: [[Captain]] [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]]. After being beamed down by [[Commander]] [[Spock]], Kirk arrives in what seems to be a [[USS Enterprise (replica)|completely depopulated ''Enterprise'']]. He presumes the beam-down was unsuccessful, and upon arriving on the empty [[bridge]] satisfies himself from looking at the [[viewscreen]] that he and the ship are ""still orbiting Gideon.""  ===Act One===  In a [[corridor]], Kirk continues to search every part of the ship, and can find no-one. He has sustained a bruise on his arm, but has lost any recollection of the incident or, indeed, the minutes in which it occurred.  While speaking to Spock via a video screen, the High Council's Ambassador [[Hodin]] denies responsibility for the loss of the captain, suggesting that the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s equipment must be faulty. Hodin repeats the coordinates for Kirk's transport that were given to the ''Enterprise'', which [[Pavel Chekov|Chekov]] confirms on a [[PADD]] that he was sent to. He frustrates ship's [[surgeon]] [[Leonard McCoy|McCoy]] and even [[First Officer]] Spock with his steadfast refusal to drop his planet's sensor-jamming [[shields]]. He claims they are necessary to protect the Gideons against any ""contaminating contact"" with violent otherworldly nature. Hodin does assent to a ""thorough search"" but pretends that Spock has agreed that the High Council should be the party to institute it.  While continuing his search, Kirk encounters a young woman wandering the empty corridors of the ship in an ecstasy of new-found personal space. Telling Kirk that her name is [[Odona]], she says that on her world ""''thousands pressed in against me. I could hardly breathe.''"" When she evinces fear Kirk consoles her, offering his hand. She notes that Kirk too seems to be troubled. The captain says he is; ""''I seem to be the only one of my crew left on board the ''Enterprise''. 430&hellip; and I apparently am the only one left.''""  [[Lieutenant]] [[Nyota Uhura|Uhura]] tells Spock that [[Starfleet]] wants him to go through diplomatic channels &ndash; the Federation &ndash; but that the department she has been referred to, the [[Federation Bureau of Planetary Treaties|Bureau of Planetary Treaties]], has, of course, no treaty with the Gideon and wishes Starfleet to handle the crisis. Spock muses that diplomats and bureaucrats may function differently, but they seem to achieve the same results.  Seeing the [[chronometer]] on the [[astrogator]], Kirk says that there are indeed some nine minutes that are unaccounted for since his transport. Odona is plainly a Gideon, but apparently is not in the habit of calling her world by that name. Putting the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s forward environs onto the main viewer, Kirk finds that they seem no longer to be in orbit, but rather in some unfamiliar [[Stellar cartography#United Federation of Planets, et al.|quadrant]].  ===Act Two=== Meanwhile, back on the real USS ''Enterprise'', the ambassador informs Spock that Kirk is not on Gideon after conducting a thorough search of the planet by the natives. However, Spock insists on transporting to the planet. The ambassador grants permission with the provision that a Gideon co-worker beam aboard the ''Enterprise''. Spock agrees, and [[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]] beams [[Krodak]], a Gideon representative aboard, but when Spock begins to press for his beam-down to the planet, the Gideon ambassador prevaricates again, and claims that he has acted outside his authority to grant Spock the permission to come to the planet. Spock is clearly insistent and exasperated by both the bureaucratic logjam in the Federation, and by the diplomatic stonewalling of the ambassador. He tells Uhura to demand an answer from Starfleet about the issue of beaming to the planet's surface.  At the same time, Kirk and Odona are together on the bridge of the empty ''Enterprise'', and unable to raise any form of communication at all. At the [[engineering station]], the captain drops the ship out of [[warp]], explaining this to Odona, who remarks that it feels exactly the same as when they were at warp. This raises Kirk's attention because there ""''is no change in how the ship feels.''"" He grows suspicious and looks at the viewscreen, which is displaying a field of stars moving slowly. Odona asks Kirk if he is having a problem with the way the stars look.  After Odona and Kirk toy with the idea of remaining alone aboard the ''Enterprise'', Kirk decides he has to discover and contact whoever is manipulating them. He asks Odona about her homeworld, and she says she does not remember; she only knows that she is, at the moment, happy. She explains that her home planet is packed to the brim with people. There is not one area on the surface where an individual can find solitude, in fact, there are some who would kill for it. Odona and Kirk embrace, but as they do so, the faces of other hooded people appear on the viewscreen unseen by them.  ===Act Three=== While Kirk and Odona walk about the ship and discuss Kirk's bruise, they hear a strange thumping noise. Though Odona believes it is the engines or a storm, Kirk says he knows every sound the ''Enterprise'' makes and that is not one of them. He opens a viewport, which shows an ordinary star field after a momentary ghostly appearance of the dense planetary population ''en masse'' &ndash; all of whom wear bodysuits covering all but their faces and hands &ndash; with Kirk surmising the thumping sound was the heartbeats of all the people he saw outside the window.  As Kirk begins to request answers from Odona, she begins to feel faint with the manifest prognostics of illness as the ambassador &ndash; her father &ndash; and his aides watch on a video screen in the council chamber, unknown to them. Hodin, accompanied by two bodysuited guards, then boards what Kirk now knows to be a fake ''Enterprise''. The captain and the ambassador partake in a brief exchange regarding Odona's health before Hodin takes Kirk prisoner and lays Odona in a bed in the captain's quarters.  ===Act Four=== Spock contacts Starfleet Command and argues with [[Admiral]] {{dis|Fitzgerald|Admiral}}, who refuses to allow Spock to beam down to the planet's surface without being able to determine that Kirk's life is in immediate danger.  On the planet, Hodin comforts Odona in Kirk's quarters, expecting her to die. However, he asks her what pain is like, foreign to both of them, and is proud of her strength in fighting the infection. Going outside to Kirk, he reveals he knows what she has &ndash; [[Vegan choriomeningitis]] &ndash; and that they sought Kirk out because they knew he had once almost died of it. Kirk attempts to subdue the guards unsuccessfully.  On the ''Enterprise'', Spock finally resolves to violate Starfleet orders and search for Kirk. He demonstrates the slight difference between the coordinates given them for beaming down Kirk to those beaming up the Gideon councilman, Krodak. He orders McCoy and the others to remain aboard the ''Enterprise'', leaving Scott in command.  Hodin explains to Kirk in the council chambers how Gideon was once a paradise, and its atmosphere has always been germ-free. The people's lifespans increased, and death became almost unknown to the Gideons. The birthrate continued to rise until Gideon became encased in a ""living mass,"" with no space to live in comfort. Hodin says {{dis|sterilization|medicine}} is impossible as their organs renew, and contraception is unthinkable because of their ""love of life."" Eventually, they decided to introduce mortal illness to Gideon, choosing Kirk as its source, and Odona as an inspirational model of self-sacrificial heroism. Hodin tries to convince Kirk to stay and provide the necessary [[virus]], but Kirk argues against it. They are notified of the approaching death of Odona and they go to her.  Meanwhile, Spock initiates a search for Kirk on the duplicate ''Enterprise'' and surmises that this is some experiment and Kirk is in danger. Reaching the captain's quarters, Spock quickly subdues the guards outside: one with a [[Vulcan neck pinch]], and the other knocked out after Spock grabs and hurls him down the corridor. On Kirk's orders, Spock asks Scotty to beam up him, Kirk, and Odona to the ''Enterprise'' immediately. But before they dematerialize, however, Spock warns Hodin not to interfere &ndash; ""''I already have one serious problem to resolve with upper echelons.''""  In [[sickbay]], McCoy then cures Odona and Kirk shows her around the real ''Enterprise'', now filled with people. She tries in vain to persuade Kirk to go live with her on Gideon, wishing her homeworld could now fit one more person on it. Kirk alerts Transporter Control that they have a person to beam down, as Kirk and Odona prepare to part ways.  Kirk returns to command the Enterprise and Odona returning to Gideon to save her people. The ''Enterprise'' travels on through space, en route to its next destination.   "

We are approaching [[Bilana III]] where a new method of [[propulsion]] known as the [[soliton wave]] is being developed. The ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]'' has been asked to participate in one of the first tests of this new technology.''""    In [[engineering]], [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Geordi La Forge]] is visibly excited about the history-making events about to transpire. He likens it to being present to see [[Chuck Yeager]] break the [[sound barrier]] or [[Zefram Cochrane]] engage the first [[warp drive]]. Lieutenant Commander [[Data]] and [[Lieutenant]] [[Worf]] don't share his enthusiasm. La Forge leaves them to talk with [[Crewman]] [[Donaldson]], a fellow [[engineer]] who may be more receptive.   Worf receives a [[subspace communication]] from the transport ship ''{{dis|Milan|starship}}''. It is Worf's mother, [[Helena Rozhenko]], who has brought with her Worf's son, [[Alexander Rozhenko|Alexander]], to visit. Worf makes arrangements for them to come aboard.  In the [[transporter room]], Worf greets his mother and son stiffly and asks ""''How long can you stay?''"", to which Alexander replies, ""''I'm not going back''.""  === Act One === Worf and his mother enter [[Ten Forward]] and sit down together at a table. Helena explains to Worf that she and [[Sergey Rozhenko|Worf's father]] are getting older and cannot take proper care of Alexander anymore and that he needs to be with his father. Worf protests that it is ""''not possible''"" and that they must find another option. Helena says that Alexander ""''needs ''his'' father''"" and that Alexander has been having difficulties with his behavior, even lying on occasion. She insists that he needs his father for guidance. Worf seems to agree with her.   Afterward, Worf and Alexander are walking in a [[corridor]] to visit the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s [[primary school]] [[teacher]], Miss {{dis|Kyle|teacher}}. Worf is stiffly asking questions of Alexander, who is giving one-word answers and Worf can only respond with ""''good.''"" When they arrive and are introduced, Miss Kyle asks Alexander to spell his last name for her. He isn't paying attention and the teacher moves on to another question, Alexander's date of birth. Worf doesn't know the answer and Alexander is clearly disappointed and answers, ""''The forty-third day of [[Maktag]], Stardate [[2366|43205]].''"" When Kyle asks Worf how long Alexander will be on board, he replies that it hasn't been decided. Alexander looks crushed.  [[Captain]] [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] is waiting in his [[captain's ready room|ready room]] tapping an [[isolinear chip]] and looking somewhat annoyed. Worf enters and Picard mildly upbraids him for being late then begins speaking about newly transferred [[security officer]]s coming on duty when they are interrupted by a call from Miss Kyle asking about scheduling placement tests for Alexander. Worf cuts her off and says he will speak to her at another time. Picard continues, only to be interrupted again by [[Doctor]] [[Beverly Crusher|Crusher]] calling Worf from [[sickbay]] to ask about scheduling a physical examination of Alexander. Worf asks her if they can discuss it later and apologizes to Picard for the interruptions. Picard tells Worf to take care of his son and that the security matters can wait. He seems mildly amused as Worf leaves.  [[Doctor]] [[Ja'Dar]] is briefing the [[senior staff]] in the [[observation lounge]] about the upcoming experiment. He says that there are twenty-three [[warp coil|field coils]] on the planet working in concert to generate the soliton wave. The [[soliton wave rider|test ship]] will be towed to a position approximately two million [[kilometer]]s from the planet. The plan is for the wave to envelop the ship and push it into warp. Picard comments, ""''Warp without warp drive,''"" and [[Commander]] [[William T. Riker|Riker]] [[joke]]s that this could put La Forge out of a job, to which La Forge says he hopes so. Data asks how closely the ''Enterprise'' will need to follow the test vehicle and Ja'Dar responds that the soliton emits a great deal of [[subspace radio]] interference so they must remain within twenty kilometers in order to receive telemetry. Picard asks how the experiment will be terminated and is told that the wave is being directed toward the [[planet]] [[Lemma II]], about three [[light year]]s away where their sister facility will generate a [[scattering field]] to dissipate the wave and bring the ship out of warp. The briefing ends and the staff leaves, while La Forge stays behind to speak some more with Ja'Dar.  On the bridge, [[Counselor]] [[Deanna Troi]] approaches Worf and informs him that she has spoken with ''Mrs.'' Kyle about Alexander being enrolled in the ship's primary school. She asks if Worf is planning to attend the father and son field trip scheduled for later in the afternoon. Worf replies that he has a personnel review scheduled for 1300 hours. Troi replies that it would be a good opportunity for Worf to get to know the other students and parents. Worf decides to reschedule the review so they can attend. Troi informs Worf that she will let them know that he and Alexander will attend, much to his chagrin.  On the [[field trip]], Miss Kyle is showing her class and the parents a pair of animals from [[Corvan II]] in a [[cage]] while Alexander is looking at some small animal models on a table. While keeping an eye on Alexander, Miss Kyle explains that the animals are called [[Corvan gilvo|gilvos]] and that their eating habits are similar to that of [[Earth]]'s [[draco lizard]], which went [[Extinction|extinct]] more than three hundred years ago. She goes on to say there are only fourteen gilvos left on Corvan II, so the ''Enterprise'' is transplanting this pair to the protected planet [[Brentalia]] where they will be able to thrive. After her lecture, Miss Kyle gently confronts Alexander about taking a model lizard from the table, trying to make it out to be a misunderstanding. Worf is angry at even the hint of an [[accusation]] and asks his son if he took the model. He looks directly at Worf and denies it. Miss Kyle insists that she saw Alexander put the model into his jacket. Worf reaches into Alexander's pocket and removes the lizard model; Alexander has lied to Worf's face.  === Act Two === :""''Lieutenant Worf, [[personal log]], Stardate 45376.8. Alexander has acted shamefully and as his father, I must now deal with him. But I find that I would rather fight ten [[Balduk]] warriors than face one small child.''""   In his [[quarters]], Worf is pacing and lecturing Alexander who is seated and staring at the floor. He is telling his son about [[honor]] and how ""''a [[Klingon]]'s word is his bond; without it he is nothing.''"" Alexander doesn't know why he stole or lied, and this infuriates Worf, who quickly calms down and takes Alexander into the next room and sits down with him on a couch. He points out a stature of two figures locked in hand-to-hand combat. He asks Alexander if he knows who they are. Alexander knows that one of them is [[Kahless]], and Worf tells him that the other one is Kahless' brother, [[Morath]]. They are fighting because Morath told a lie and brought shame and dishonor to their family. They fought for twelve days and nights. Worf explains to Alexander that when he lies, he is dishonoring his own family in the same way, and that he is dishonoring Worf. Alexander promises never to lie again.   In the corridor, Troi asks Worf about the field trip. As they enter the [[turbolift]] en route to the [[bridge]], Worf recounts the incident with the model and the lie. Troi offers to help if there are any further problems, but Worf is confident that Alexander will not repeat the behavior.   On the bridge, the ''Enterprise'' is linked telemetrically to the test ship and Dr. Ja'Dar begins the launch sequence for the soliton wave. The wave rockets from the surface of the planet and envelops the test ship which successfully enters warp. The ''Enterprise'' follows and moves to within twenty kilometers. La Forge reports that the ship's speed is warp 2.35, slightly faster than they expected. Picard asks if the wave is affecting the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s warp drive, but Data replies that it is not. La Forge reports that the power efficiency of the wave is 98 percent. Data remarks that is 450% more efficient than their own warp engines. Suddenly, the wave's power signature fluctuates and efficiency drops to 73%. Then a subspace distortion is detected and hits the ''Enterprise''. La Forge is unable to compensate and Picard is forced to order [[Ensign]] [[Felton]] to put all stop on the engines just as the test ship explodes. The explosion ripples through the ''Enterprise'', knocking most of the bridge crew to the deck.  === Act Three ===  [[Sensor]]s and warp drive are off line and deflectors are at 15%. Dr. Ja'Dar sends a message from the surface of Bilana III asking if everyone is all right. He speculates that there was a transient power imbalance and La Forge confirms this as consistent with the telemetry readings from the ship before it exploded. Though the experiment wasn't entirely successful, La Forge congratulates Ja'Dar for achieving warp without warp drive and hopes to witness the next test in person.  Worf meets with Miss Kyle to discuss Alexander. She is concerned with his demeanor in class. Worf dismisses it as typical [[Klingon]] child behavior and suggests that Kyle use a ""''firm hand.''"" She reports that Alexander is still stealing and lying and that perhaps they should meet with Counselor Troi. Worf interrupts her, stands, and inquires of the ship's [[computer]] the whereabouts of his son. The computer reports that he is on [[Holodeck]] 4. Worf turns as he leaves and tells Miss Kyle that he will ""''handle this.''""  When Worf arrives at Holodeck 4, he discovers that Alexander is running his [[Klingon calisthenics program|calisthenics]] program &ndash; at the novice level. Worf enters the holodeck and finds Alexander fighting a [[skeleton]]-headed [[holographic]] adversary. Alexander wins the battle and Worf freezes the program. Alexander has taken Worf's ''[[bat'leth]]'' and used the holodeck without permission. Worf confronts Alexander about his disobedience to Miss Kyle. He denies doing it and Worf orders him back to their [[quarters]], lamenting his own failure in his fatherly duties. Alexander doesn't leave and argues with his father. Worf decides to send him to a Klingon school and Alexander shouts that he ""''won't go.''"" With that, Worf demands that he return to their quarters and remain there.  Back on the bridge, Riker is informed by La Forge that it will be another hour until engines are back online. Sensors come back up and Data determines that the soliton wave is still on course for the Lemma II colony, and that the wave has increased velocity to warp 4.1. Riker repeats these findings to Dr. Ja'Dar and Data adds that the energy level of the wave has increased twelve times and will increase by a factor of two hundred by the time it reaches Lemma II. Ja'Dar announces that at such a power level, not only will the colony be destroyed, but most of the planet as well.  === Act Four === Worf and Troi are meeting to discuss his decision to send Alexander away to a Klingon school. Troi asks Worf many questions that Worf seems to have difficulty answering. She also mentions Alexander's mother, [[K'Ehleyr]], who was killed by [[Duras, son of Ja'rod|an enemy]] of Worf's while [[Reunion (episode)|they were visiting him]]. It was at this time that Worf sent Alexander to live with the [[Rozhenko family|Rozhenkos]] on [[Earth]]. Troi opines that for Alexander, this was like losing both parents at the same time.   Worf listens, then tells Troi about the last time he spoke to K'Ehleyr. They argued about how K'Ehleyr kept her [[pregnancy]] and Alexander's birth a secret from Worf. He recalls that he was angry at her at the time for not revealing this to him sooner. Troi helps Worf deal with his anger over the episode and suggests that he and Alexander should work together on healing, as they both have a lot to do together.  When Worf returns to his quarters, Alexander is packing a suitcase. He believes that Worf is ashamed of him and is sending him away for that reason. Worf tries to explain the reason for sending him away, but Alexander doesn't understand. Worf is called to the observation lounge by Commander Riker, but before he leaves, he instructs Alexander to remain in their quarters. After Worf exits, Alexander angrily knocks his suitcase off a table and leaves his father's quarters.  Picard enters the observation lounge where La Forge and Data are waiting. La Forge begins speaking as soon as the captain is seated when Worf comes in, interrupting him. La Forge continues to explain that the wave's energy level has increased by a factor of ninety-six and will hit the planet within a couple of hours. Picard asks how they can stop it and La Forge replies that there are two options. The first is to use the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s warp engines to create an [[inverse resonance wave]], but since the soliton wave is constantly changing its frequency and amplitude, it would be extremely difficult to match it exactly. The second option is a little more dangerous but has a better chance of success: they could create a backfire by making a large enough explosion consisting of five [[photon torpedo]]es and setting it off just in front of the wave, which would disrupt it and cause it to dissipate. The wave is now traveling at warp 6.37 according to Data, and while the ''Enterprise'' can catch up to it, for the plan to work, the ship must get in front of it to set off the explosion. Due to the increasing size and power of the wave, it is no longer possible to circumvent it before it reaches Lemma II; they have to go ''through'' it. Worf warns that the shields are only at 33%, as they have not yet been fully restored after the explosion of the test ship, and thus the ''Enterprise'' would be in for a rough ride. Picard says it's the better choice and orders a course to be set to intercept the soliton wave.  The wave is now at warp 7.2. Picard orders Ensign Felton to increase speed and hold relative position twenty-three kilometers in front of the wave. She increases speed to warp 7.21. As they approach the wave, Riker orders [[red alert]] and [[torpedo bay]]s to be loaded with [[warhead]]s set to Level 16. The ''Enterprise'' increases speed to warp 7.3 and everyone braces for impact.  Alexander has disobeyed his father and snuck into the biolab. He switches on the light in the gilvos' cage when the ship is jolted by the wave, knocking him to the floor.    The ''Enterprise'' has encountered the soliton wave and has passed through it, but it has been a rough ride. They take position in front of it and Worf reports that there are fluctuations in several [[warp transfer conduit]]s and that [[deflector]] strength is down to 12%. Riker reports gaps in the [[aft]] [[shields]] and recommends that they evacuate [[Galaxy class decks|Section]]s 24 through [[47]], [[Deck]]s 35 through 38 to avoid exposing the crew in these areas to [[ionizing radiation|ion radiation]]. Worf suddenly reports that there is a [[fire]] in Biolab 4 and that [[fire-suppression apparatus]] was not working. Data reports that there are lifeforms in the biolab and that one is [[humanoid]]. The computer identifies the occupant of the biolab as Alexander Rozhenko to Worf's horror.  === Act Five === Picard tries to contact Alexander, but there is no response. Internal sensors show that he is alive but may be injured. Felton announces that warp power is dropping, and the ship is losing speed. Riker contacts La Forge in [[engineering]] for an explanation. La Forge reports that they lost four warp plasma conduits and can't maintain current speed much longer. Data states that they are four minutes and thirty seconds in front of the wave as Worf asks permission to leave the bridge to rescue Alexander. Picard grants it and sends Riker along to help. Data says that Biolab 4 is one of the areas that will be flooded with ion radiation when the torpedoes explode. Picard states that he must protect the colony at all costs and gives Worf and Riker ""''three minutes, not one second more.''""  Riker and Worf arrive at the biolab but can't open the doors because the primary control is shorted out. Worf rips off an access panel and is able to open the doors by rearranging isolinear chips. Flames burst into the corridor and the two enter the smoke-filled room. They call out for Alexander but there is no response. On the bridge, Data announces that the soliton wave has closed to ten kilometers. Torpedoes are at standby as Worf finds Alexander unconscious under a fallen beam. He is still alive, but Riker and Worf cannot move the beam that has fallen on his leg. As Riker goes to find something to help them lift the beam, Alexander regains consciousness and tells Worf that his leg hurts and that he's scared. Worf summons strength from this and struggles to lift the beam himself. He does so and throws it aside just as Riker is returning with a lever. They move away more debris and Worf takes Alexander into his arms. Alexander pleads with Riker to save the gilvos (which are trapped in their cage) and although there is little time, Riker does so as the wave closes to one kilometer. Picard has run out of time and orders the torpedoes launched.    Worf and Riker exit the burning biolab carrying Alexander and the gilvos as the torpedoes explode, successfully disrupting the soliton wave. Riker reports to Picard that they made it out in time and that the boy will be fine.  Later, Worf and Alexander are in [[sickbay]] with Dr. Crusher who finds that Alexander has suffered some minor smoke inhalation and has a [[hairline fracture]] of the [[tibia]]. She wants to keep him overnight but announces that he will be fine. After she leaves, Alexander is worried that he is in trouble, to which Worf responds, ""''yes.''"" Alexander apologizes and promises to be good at the Klingon school. Worf explains how difficult and demanding the Klingon school is, but that if Alexander would like an even greater challenge, he can stay on the ''Enterprise'' with Worf, and they can face the difficulties together. Alexander replies, ""''I accept your challenge, father. I will stay.''"" Worf replies, ""''I believe your mother would be pleased.''"" "

Two teenagers–Peter Wood, an academically overachieving loner from 1985, and Charity Payne, a Puritan from 1700 Colonial Massachusetts, come in telepathic contact with each other when they have high fever from the same bacterial infection. After Peter convinces Charity she is not bedeviled, they find they enjoy each other's conversation and remain in frequent contact as they go about their day. Peter is heartened to have made at least one friend, while Charity is intrigued by the future events and technologies he tells her about.

At Peter's coaxing, Charity tells her neighbors about some of her ""future visions"", including the American Revolution. The notion that the Thirteen Colonies will eventually revolt against their government is controversial, and a posse led by Squire Jonas Hacker visits Charity's home to follow up on suspicions she is a witch. When Hacker tries to examine Charity for a witches' mark, she fears he intends to sexually molest her and flees.

Peter tells Charity to take refuge in a region less beset by panic over witchcraft, but she refuses to leave her home, so he searches library records of witch trials to see if she will be tried if she comes out of hiding. He instead stumbles on a biographical entry on Hacker, who was posthumously convicted of a double homicide. At her trial, Charity claims that her visions come not from witchcraft, but from a God-given second sight, and uses her knowledge of the murders to blackmail Hacker into supporting her claims. After her acquittal, Charity breaks off her relationship with Peter so that she will not risk getting into trouble again.

A year later, Peter receives one last telepathic call from Charity. She has left him a message at a local landmark known as Bear Rock. Peter finds Charity's message: chiseled into Bear Rock are the initials ""CP + PW"" inside a heart shape.

[[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] brings a Volkswagen van from the 1970s to the [[Planet Express Building]], but then he finds out that fossil fuels haven't been used in centuries. [[Bender Bending Rodríguez|Bender]] gets coaxed into using the giant can opener to open a can of [[Whale oil]], which has replaced gasoline. After complaining that the can opener nearly cut his head off one time, he is sucked up by the magnet, cut in a spiral and is completely immobilized. While Bender is in the hospital, he meets [[Beck's Head]], who is being attached to a mannequin he found in a dumpster. Beck gives a speech to Bender and gives him a pair of [[robot]] arms to wear around his neck and to play his cut-up torso as a washboard. Beck invites Bender to play in his concert tour. Fry proposes that the [[Planet Express Crew]] follow Bender in the hippie van, but only a few of them come along while [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] and [[Hermes Conrad|Hermes]] stay behind.

Fry and the rest of the crew do their laundry and [[Zoidberg|Zoidberg's]] shell runs in the wash, tye-dyeing all the clothes. When [[Amy]] tries to buy something at one of the concerts, she discovers that all of the money was destroyed in the wash, including the change. While on the road, Zoidberg keeps getting sick and coughing up pebbles that are surprisingly pretty and colorful which the others use as a money-making tool. After a forty minute washboard solo that put Beck to sleep, the concert ends. The concert hall is next to a broken robot smelting facility that makes broken robots into paperweights. Bender declares that he will be an icon and a role model for broken robots and that he will play and raise money for them in [[Bend-Aid]].

A day before Bend-Aid, Bender is at the hotel when Fry and the crew walk in and realize that life is better without television. They turn it on and see the Bend-Aid preview. To everyone's amazement Bender gets up and walks during his speech. The next day during the concert, Bender fakes paralysis, while Fry and the crew proceed to sell Zoidberg's ""Love beads"". Before the concert, Bender is presented with a very large check. During the concert, Bender shows off and dances. Angry, all the broken robots try to re-break Bender. Bender takes Fry's Van and drives it around San Fransisco in a Bullitt-style chase. During the chase, Bender drives the Van off a Hoverbridge and it lands on a spot of land. However, Bender is shot into the air. When Bender surfaces he is immediately hit by Beck's bus and tries to fake being paralyzed again but Beck takes the check back. Bender takes a magnet, sticks it on his head and he walks out into the bay to the van, singing, ""Fry cracked corn and I don't care, Leela cracked corn and I don't care, Bender cracked corn and he is great, take that you stupid corn!""

== Overview ==
The [[boys from the Dwarf]] encounter ''Enlightenment'', a legendary [[holoship]] made entirely of light and crewed by highly trained, and extremely arrogant, [[hologram]]s. [[Arnold Rimmer]] prepares to leave the Dwarfers to join the holoship where he can have everything he ever wanted - an effective physical presence, have constant sex, become an officer, and finally find love. However, it will come at a price...

== Summary ==
It's another normal day around ''[[Red Dwarf (ship)|Red Dwarf]]'', with [[Dave Lister]] getting emotional over a romantic film and Rimmer deriding the plot where a man gives up his dreams for a woman he's never going to see again anyway.

The discussion is halted when ''[[Starbug]]'' finds a ship that reads no mass or density, a holoship called ''[[Enlightenment]]'', and after scanning the 'bug it abducts Rimmer. [[Cat]] wants to get out of there before they bring him back. Soon after, a reconnaissance officer, [[Binks]], transmits aboard and begins to talk into a walkie-talkie about how inferior the 'bug is. He mocks the Dwarfers incessantly, causing a bit of back-and-forth between Binks and Lister, until Lister gets angry, eats a cigarette and threatens to get out a [[holowhip]], causing a hasty retreat by Binks.

Meanwhile, aboard the holopship Rimmer learns that the ship is crewed by the best officers in the [[Space Corps]] and is like a dream-come-true for Rimmer. As an entirely [[Hologram|hologrammatic]] vessel, everything aboard can be touched and tasted by Rimmer. The crew are arrogant geniuses. The women are beautiful and eager to have recreational sex, with everyone aboard having 'evolved' past things like love. He befriends one of female crew, named [[Nirvanah Crane]], who takes him to the bridge. When Rimmer asks to join the crew, the captain [[Hercule Platini]] informs him that there is only one way aboard: ""Dead man's boots""; he'll have to defeat one of the current crew in a challenge of wits, who would then be deactivated so he could take their place.

Leaving the meeting, Nirvanah asks Rimmer if he wants to have sex and he is happy to oblige. Later, the two have some pillow talk and try to brush off the experience as just casual (as everyone aboard the ship is expected to do) but there are clearly some feelings between the two. Rimmer is then transmitted back to ''Red Dwarf'', and Nirvanah is then told by the ship's computer [[Stocky]] that it has been chosen her to be Rimmer's challenger.

Since everyone aboard ''Enlightenment'' is a genius, Rimmer takes drastic measures to cheat his way aboard. He asks Kryten to give him a [[Mind Patch]], a risky and [[Space Corps Directives|illegal]] procedure that could either make Rimmer a genius or a dribbling wreck. Luckily for Rimmer, it makes him a genius, with the two greatest minds on file aboard ''Red Dwarf'' - [[Buchan]] and [[McQueen]] - and a now smug and confident Rimmer returns to ''Enlightenment'' to face the challenge. His chances of victory look so strong that the other Dwarfers begin looking for a replacement hologram, including [[Sam Murray]] and [[Harrison]] (and in a deleted scene, a hologram copy of Lister himself). In the midst of it, Rimmer's Mind Patch wears off and he runs back to ''Red Dwarf'' to have another one done, but Kryten says that it would be impossible. Rimmer returns to ''Enlightenment'' to withdraw from the challenge.

In the elevator, Rimmer confesses to Nirvanah about the Mind Patch and tells her that everything he wants is aboard the ship and a posting here would have been his chance to be someone important instead of just the hologram of a vending-machine repairman aboard a mining ship. Nirvanah promises him he'll achieve his dream before leaving. Rimmer later finds out that his opponent withdrew from the challenge and he leaves ''Red Dwarf'' behind that evening, telling his shipmates he regards them as ''""people I met""''.

Rimmer is shown to his quarters... or rather, what used to be Nirvanah's quarters and he is then told she was his opponent. Rimmer realises that Nirvanah withdrew because she fell in love with him, and he is also in love with her so, despite his earlier declaration that he would never choose a woman over his career, promptly resigns his commission so she can be restored. Captain Platini agrees to transfer Rimmer back to ''Red Dwarf'', but tells Rimmer that the resignation doesn't solve anything as he and Nirvanah will still be apart. Rimmer gives him an eloquent response:

''""Oh and sir, you're wrong. We won't be apart, we just ... won't be together.""''

Rimmer's face changes into one of disgust, unable to quite believe he said such a corny line.

===Episode Summary===
A bum, Nate Bledsoe, snatches a pair of nifty shoes from the target of a mob hit dumped in an alley, and receives a dose of personality. The shoes infuse him with the personality of the victim, and so he decides to pick up where he left off. He stops by the home of the victim's girlfriend, who does not know the face, but recognizes the manner and kiss. He then goes to a bar to deliver a message to Dagget, the boss who had him killed. Dagget is at first unsettled, but gets the drop on Nate and Nate is gunned down. Before he dies, the spirit vows to return until he finishes Dagget off. The body (with shoes) is dumped in the same place the original victim was dumped, and another bum finds the corpse and steals the shoes. As the episode ends, a look of determination slowly appears on his face.

==Summary==
=== Teaser ===
:""''[[Captain's log]], [[Stardate]] 46682.4. The ''Enterprise'' is docked at the [[Remmler Array]] where it will undergo a routine procedure to eliminate accumulated [[baryon]] particles. In preparation for the sweep, we are evacuating the ship.''""

The {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-D|-D}} is at the [[Remmler Array]] where they are scheduled for a [[baryon sweep]], a maintenance cycle that removes large amounts of [[radiation]] that builds up in the [[hull]]s of [[starship]]s that travel for extended periods at [[warp]]. The sweep is lethal to any organic matter, so there is a flurry of activity as the entire ship is being evacuated prior to the sweep, and various last-minute problems (such as slow progress on Decks 7 and 8 and a lack of [[stasis unit]]s for [[Dr.]] [[Beverly Crusher|Crusher]]'s living tissue samples) are being quickly addressed. [[Captain]] [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] is less than enthusiastic over the visit, as he has to meet with [[Commander]] [[Calvin Hutchinson|Calvin ""Hutch"" Hutchinson]], a [[Starfleet]] officer known for his gift of gab. Coincidentally, [[Data]] is studying the concept of ""[[small talk]]"", and during their [[turbolift]] ride to the [[bridge]], Data tries to break the silence this way; Picard recommends that Data study Hutchinson so as to learn from an expert on the subject. 

Arriving on the bridge, Picard is met by both [[Geordi La Forge|La Forge]] and [[Worf]], speaking simultaneously. Worf reports that Picard must give his authorization to disable command functions during the sweep. Then La Forge informs Picard that he needs to install additional [[field diverter]]s to protect the primary systems on board, such as the [[computer core]] and the bridge. He needs the equipment because the amount of radiation in the hull is so high (due to five years of the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s high amount of warp use&ndash;double the average) that the baryon sweep may be more intense than normal. Picard agrees and instructs the ship's [[computer]] to shut down the primary systems in 30 minutes, allowing enough time for the diverters to be installed first. Worf then asks permission to be excused from Hutchinson's reception. When La Forge witnesses Picard agree to Worf's request, he attempts to do the same only to be denied because Picard can't excuse all of the senior staff, and Worf asked first and thus beat him to it. Picard then goes to his [[Captain's ready room|ready room]] to confirm the time of the sweep to [[Orton]], the station administrator, and takes one last look around the bridge. He then sees a crew walking onto the bridge to install some equipment. Assuming that was the crew that La Forge ordered, he thinks nothing of it and [[transporter|transport]]s to Hutchinson's reception at the [[Arkaria Base]].

=== Act One ===

True to form, Hutchinson greets each member of the crew and talks about [[Arkarian horn fowl]] mating habits, [[weather]] conditions, and [[horseback riding]] with little interaction from them. Data, following Picard's advice, is studying Hutchinson from afar: mimicking his hand movements and facial expressions. Briefly practicing on Crusher and [[William T. Riker|Riker]], he appears to be over-doing it, but Riker is quite amused. Picard hears about the horseback riding from Hutchinson and sees a way to escape from the meeting &ndash; the damp weather and isolation on the trails sounds perfect &ndash; and returns to the ''Enterprise'' to get his [[saddle]]. 

After retrieving his saddle, Picard walks to the [[transporter room]] with minutes before the sweep is to occur, but stops when he notices an open [[Optical data network|ODN]] junction with a severed ODN line. He encounters [[Devor]], who says he is performing last minute maintenance to the systems before the baryon sweep begins. Picard agrees to let Devor get back to his work and starts to walk away. Devor attempts to attack Picard from behind with a [[laser welder]], but Picard knocks him to the floor with his saddle and then disables him with a [[Vulcan nerve pinch]]. Picard then runs to the transporter room with 30 seconds to spare before the main computer shuts down the primary systems. Picard then sees several other people on the ship, but successfully hides from them in order to escape. Meanwhile, the baryon sweep has begun, starting at the [[warp nacelle]]s. He enters the transporter room and activates the [[transporter console]] for beam down, but he is too late and it immediately shuts down once he stands on the [[transporter pad]]. He is now trapped on the ''Enterprise''.

=== Act Two ===
Data is continuing his small talk on Orton, still with little success while Hutchinson talks to Riker. After a little bit of maneuvering, he introduces Hutchinson to Data, who has been practicing Hutchinson's technique and is now ready to engage Hutchinson himself in conversation. They hit it off immediately.

Picard drags Devor to [[sickbay]], opening the deactivated doors with an [[emergency hand actuator]], and asks him what he is doing on his ship, threatening him with a [[phaser]], and then the laser welder when Devor tells him that his phaser would not work from the intense [[plasma field]] the baryon sweep generates. Devor refuses to help him; after all, Picard won't kill him because he is a [[Starfleet]] officer. Picard instead knocks him out with a [[hypospray]]. Picard takes Devor's [[communicator]] to listen in on the intruders' communications. Picard walks through the ''Enterprise'' where he is captured by [[Kiros]] while he is trying to open an access hatch in a turbolift and is taken to [[main engineering]].

At Arkaria Base, Riker and [[Deanna Troi]] watch with fascination as Hutchinson and Data continue to talk: Hutchinson is a pro, but Data is a fast learner with inhuman patience. Just then, La Forge notices through his [[VISOR]] that there are unusual energy readings underneath a reception table and asks a member of the staff if he can take a look at it. The staff member tells him there's nothing to worry about, telling him it is likely a malfunctioning heating element. During this, Riker is wondering why the staff is trying to move La Forge away from the table. Orton then pulls out a [[disruptor]] and shoots La Forge, injuring him. An accomplice uses another disruptor to shoot Hutchinson. The Arkarians point their disruptors at Riker, Data and Troi before they can react and demand they all stay where they are. The base has been overtaken in a surprise attack.

=== Act Three ===
On the ''Enterprise'', Picard meets [[Kelsey]] and her crew, who are attempting to steal [[trilithium resin]] from the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s [[warp core]]. Picard tells her that he is [[Mot]], the ship's [[barber]] and that he simply got lost on the ship trying to collect his saddle. Picard is held under guard by [[Satler]], but eyes the field diverter with interest. 

Hutchinson was killed by the surprise attack in Arkaria Base, and La Forge is seriously injured. The rest are being held hostage but are trying to assess the situation with help from Troi's [[empathic]] abilities. The assailants have made no demands or claims, which indicates a strategic rather than psychological motive, and their anxiety indicates they're off schedule (probably because La Forge blew their cover). They're improvising, so if they plan well, they could seize the initiative. Data recommends modifying La Forge's VISOR to produce a [[hypersonic pulse]], which would knock out everyone in the room near-instantly except himself. Riker agrees but cautions to proceed covertly.

Kelsey and company still don't know that Picard has knocked out Devor and taken his laser welder. He uses this to make a move. Keeping the tool behind his back, he maneuvers it into an inlet underneath an engineering console and fires into it. This produces an overheat and activates the emergency coolant systems. Picard then uses the distraction to make an escape, knocking Satler to the floor from behind and then flees into the [[Jefferies tube]]s as the [[isolation door]] begins to close. Before he leaves, though, he fires on and shorts out Kelsey's field diverter: rendering engineering unsafe from the sweep. Satler follows him. Through the tubes, Picard is attempting to escape but finds the baryon sweep behind the door in front of him, closing in.

=== Act Four ===
Satler follows down the same corridor but only finds a closed door and Picard's jacket. By the time he realizes it's covering a hole in the floor that Picard had cut to escape, the baryon sweep passes the closed door. Satler is heard to scream as the baryon sweep consumes him; Picard pauses briefly at this, a look of regret on his face that the man's death was so painful. Picard himself prepares to make a stand, taking a [[crossbow]] from Worf's quarters. The communicator then relays Kelsey's plans. With engineering now no longer safe, they improvise a device to move the trilithium resin to [[Ten Forward]], the last place on the ship to be scanned by the baryon sweep. Picard jumps on the communicator and warns her not to move such an unstable substance, but she refuses, saying that if he hadn't disabled her field diverter, she wouldn't have to improvise. She also knows Picard is a Starfleet officer since he'd left his [[combadge]] behind in the tube. Picard responds by making it difficult to travel to Ten Forward: cutting the rungs in the Jefferies tubes and forcing Kelsey into a longer, more random, alternative route. She and Picard continue to verbally fence through the communicator, trying to intimidate each other.

On the station, Crusher uses a request for [[water]] to relay to Troi that the hypersonic pulse is almost ready, but a bright light that will appear from the VISOR when she finishes the configuration; she needs a distraction. Riker creates a diversion by starting a fistfight with Orton. Riker is knocked out, but it works. Crusher finishes the modification without further incident.

[[Pomet]] is searching for Picard in a corridor when he's struck in the leg by a crossbow bolt. He quickly passes out. The substance that had been applied to the tip turns out to be a [[Sedative|tranquilizer]] which will keep him unconscious for a while. But as Picard attempts to extract the bolt, Kiros appears, laser welder drawn at him.

=== Act Five ===
Word of ""Mot's"" capture is relayed to Kelsey as Kiros leads Picard away. Meanwhile, Kelsey and Neil are making their way through the Jefferies tubes. But when Neil passes the trilithium to Kelsey and explains how to unload it without it exploding, she promptly points her welder at him. When she finally emerges in Deck 10 and rejoins Kiros, Kelsey claims Neil got caught by the baryon sweep. Kiros notes Picard shot Pomet. Picard says that he is still alive but he will not be for much longer; they cannot go back for him as the baryon sweep is entering his location and will kill him.

Back on the planet, a signal indicating an incoming ship is approaching. Data and the others realize it's probably the terrorists' escape craft. Riker relays instructions to Data, the only one who will remain conscious after the pulse activates: stop that ship by any means. Crusher activates the hypersonic pulse, and it works as planned. Data soon proceeds unhindered to the control panel.

]]
As Kelsey, Kiros, and Picard approach Ten Forward, Picard decides to reveal his true identity, hoping to be taken as a [[hostage]], but Kelsey reveals that the trilithium is her sole objective. She's not a terrorist as Picard had suspected but a merciless thief who will steal and sell to anyone willing to pay; her only motive is [[profit]]. She tells Picard that she would prefer it be thought of as [[Trade|commerce]]. As they enter Ten Forward, though, Picard has another trap ready. He steps over several strips along the floor, but Kiros steps on one. It promptly bursts into an intense flash, stunning her. Kelsey is knocked back as well, and she drops the trilithium. She and Picard fight even as the baryon sweep finally enters Ten Forward. Kelsey eventually fights her way free of Picard and grabs the trilithium container, but Picard makes a grab for it also. Finally, Kelsey knocks Picard away and holds him at gunpoint, freeing her to be transported to [[Kelsey's scout ship|her ship]]. But with the sweep approaching, Picard's main concern is shutting it off. After several attempts to contact the station and have the sweep terminated, it finally shuts off with mere meters to spare. Data then contacts Picard and asks about the ship that had transported someone off the ''Enterprise'', to which Picard replies that they ""''won't get very far.''"" He reveals that he removed the stabilizer during the scuffle, and watches through the forward [[viewport|windows]] as Kelsey attempts to escape, only to have the resin destabilize and destroy her ship. The explosion rocks the ''Enterprise'' slightly.

Picard is in sickbay where Crusher is treating him for the injuries he incurred with the fight in Ten Forward with Kelsey. Picard is more concerned with getting back his saddle, which he left on Deck 7 after he was attempting to transport off the ''Enterprise'' before the baryon sweep began. Riker and Troi enter, stating that they've had three [[security team]]s looking for it, but couldn't find it, but fortunately Worf arrives with the saddle, which had been placed in a maintenance locker, and Picard says it came in handy, but he regrets not being able to use it on an actual horse. ""''Of course''"", Worf replies.

===Teaser===
[[Odo]] enters [[Quark's]] to inform [[Morn]] that his cargo of his [[Livanian beet]]s is starting to spoil in the [[cargo bay]] and needs to be moved immediately. When Morn doesn't respond, Odo reaches out to touch Morn's shoulder, only to find ""Morn"" is a [[hologram]]. [[Quark]] informs him that Morn has been away from the station for the past two weeks. Odo is confused, and Quark explains that Morn is such a regular fixture in his bar, that business inevitably falls off when he's not there &ndash; the last time he was away, business dropped five percent. As if to prove his point, as they are talking, Chief [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]] and Dr. [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]] enter the bar and greet ""Morn"" as they pass by, not noticing it's a hologram. Odo asks why the hologram doesn't talk, and Quark complains about the high cost of an interactive hologram generator; besides which, he prefers the company of the hologram to the real Morn, who ""never shuts up.""

Just then, [[Lt. Commander]] [[Jadzia Dax|Dax]] and [[Captain]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] enter and freeze in their tracks when they see ""Morn"" at the bar. Finding out it is only a hologram, Sisko tells Quark to shut it off. Sisko and Dax inform everyone that Morn died when his ship hit an [[ion storm]].

===Act One===
A funeral is held at Quark's according to [[Lurian]] traditions, including gifts of [[food]] and drink for the deceased so they will have something to sustain them in the [[afterlife]]. The funeral is attended by almost everyone on the station, and there are many genuine outpourings of grief. Quark, of course, attempts to capitalize on this, selling off overstocked [[Yridian ale]] by labeling it ""Morn's favorite"", and delivering a eulogy that ends by encouraging everyone to ""keep Morn's seat warm"" for eternity by spending their time in the bar. Odo is skeptical, guessing that, when all is said and done, the Ferengi didn't know anything about Morn, and is unaffected by his death. In private, Quark confides that he is deeply grieved: Morn failed to pay his last month's [[tab]] before inconsiderately dying.

Captain Sisko unseals Morn's [[Last will and testament|will]] and discovers that he left everything to Quark. In accordance with station procedure, Odo inspects the contents of the bequest, and delightedly tells Quark that Morn's bank accounts are empty, and his only ""assets"" are his most recent cargo &ndash; the now-spoiled beets &ndash; and the contents of his quarters &ndash; which turn out to consist only of a large mud bath (Morn's ""bed"") and a [[painting]] of a [[matador]]. Quark is baffled &ndash; Morn was one of his best customers, and must have had money somewhere.

Odo leaves Quark to mope in Morn's quarters, and after he leaves a nude woman appears out of the mud. The woman identifies herself as Morn's ex-wife [[Larell]], who has come to claim her share of Morn's estate. Quark is amazed when Larell confides that Morn won one thousand bricks of [[Latinum|gold-pressed latinum]] in the [[Lissepian Lottery]]. He's glad she came by.

===Act Two===
Quark starts searching for the latinum by emptying the tub of mud. Larell realizes he doesn't know where it is, and neither does she, but says it must be on the station somewhere. She starts to regret that Morn couldn't enjoy the latinum while stroking Quark's lobes, but he knows what she's doing &ndash; getting to his good graces so she can share in the latinum. Even though the latinum is Quark's, Larell threatens to tie Quark up in court for years if he doesn't cut her in. Besides, it's a lot of money and she promises to take a vacation with him. He's satisfied for the moment.

Over a game of [[tongo]], Quark has told Dax about the whole thing, and that he's cut Larell in for 10%, but Dax is suspicious, saying he needs to watch his back. Quark understands, but is willing to keep her hanging for now.

Later, Quark finds two alien brothers (race unknown), [[Krit]] and [[Nahsk]], have invaded his quarters. They claim they were business associates of Morn who had money owed to them. They then threaten Quark if he doesn't pay them, and break the matador painting over Quark's head when he tries to haggle them for a lower percentage. After they leave, however, Quark discovers there was an access chip hidden inside the painting that gave access to a [[storage locker]] in the [[Assay office]]. Quark is immediately excited and shouts out to Morn, thanking him wherever he is.

===Act Three===
[[Bajoran]] security brings a small container to Odo's security office, but it contains only a single brick of latinum. Quark isn't worried, as he notices Morn wrote a [[bank]] account number on it, for the [[Bank of Bolias]]. He excuses himself to arrange delivery of Morn's savings. 

On the way, he encounters Larell again, who steals the brick from Quark; however Quark remembers the account number and knows the bank will only deliver it to him. Still on the way, he encounters the brothers, who deliver a thinly-veiled threat before letting him go. Just as Quark is about to contact the bank in his [[quarters]], however, a [[disruptor]] is held to his head by a Human named [[Hain]]. 

===Act Four===
Hain carefully has Quark leave the terminal to escort him to a holding cell. When Quark asks, he identifies himself as working with [[Lurian Security]] and said Morn was the crown [[prince]] and that his riches belonged to the [[Royal Family of Luria]]. When Hain learned about Larell, though, he pauses to think. Hain then says she'd been trying to [[Extortion|blackmail]] the family for years. Instead of arresting Quark, Hain would ensure Quark got a sizable reward for helping capture Larell. He leaves Quark to continue calling the bank and telling him to leave the rest to him.

Meanwhile, back in the bar, Morn's absence is keenly felt. O'Brien is fixing an [[optronic relay]] while sitting in his chair, ""''keeping Morn's chair warm.''"" Bashir comes by as well, and learns Quark is indisposed. After a quick exchange, O'Brien has to leave, so Bashir takes over sitting in the chair for awhile. 

Later, Quark finds Larell in his quarters to discuss when the latinum will arrive when someone tries to pick the lock. Larell hides while Krit and Nahsk bypass the lock and threaten Quark. Quark's doorbell goes off, so Krit and Nahsk hide when Quark answers the door. Hain enters and Quark attempts to warn him of Quark's ""guests"" but he doesn't catch on while everyone in hiding comes out. It is revealed that Hain, Larell, Krit and Nahsk were all lying to Quark, and they (along with Morn) had been the ones behind the infamous [[Lissepian Mother's Day Heist]] [[2365|nine years previously]]. It turns out that Morn had betrayed them all and left with all one thousand bricks of gold-pressed latinum they had stolen, and they knew he was waiting for the [[statute of limitations]] to expire &ndash; which it did just two weeks previously. Then, the group realizes they don't need Quark any more.

===Act Five===
At first they decide to kill Quark, but he reminds them that he's the only one who can take delivery of the latinum. Nahsk has the ""bright"" idea of severing Quark's thumb (the only piece they need), but Hain steps in and vetoes the idea &ndash; since they can't very well walk into the cargo bay with a severed thumb without attracting suspicion. Since they were going to split it five ways anyway, they agree to let Quark take Morn's place.

Refusing to leave Quark alone, they all go to Quark's Bar for a drink. Odo arrives and asks why the bar is closed at that hour. Quark indicates his new ""partners,"" and introduces them as friends of Morn, with whom Quark has been ""commiserating"" in private. Quickly catching on, Odo asks how much longer they will be commiserating, and Quark says, until 1600 hours the next day &ndash; the time the shipment of latinum will arrive. 

After accepting the shipment, Quark goes to count the bricks only to find Hain, Larell, Krit and Nahsk have all drawn weapons on each other. Krit says Hain is outgunned, as his brother may be ""slow,"" but he'll get Hain in the end. Nahsk takes offense at being called slow, and turns on his brother. A firefight breaks out, so Quark jumps into the cargo container. Odo and his deputies arrive and apprehend the four robbers &ndash; Larell, being the only one unhurt, is taken to a holding cell, while the rest are taken to the infirmary. When Odo assures Quark that the four will be put in jail for a long time, Quark is ecstatic to be the sole owner of the bricks. But when he knocks two together, they crumble in his hands. Quark, aghast, says that someone has extracted all the latinum from the bricks, leaving only ""worthless gold."" ""''And it's all yours,''"" Odo chuckles gleefully while leaving an upset Quark moaning loudly over the worthless gold.

That evening, Quark is fuming behind the bar and attempts to rip Morn's stool from the floor. Odo arrives and says someone's here to see him &ndash; and in walks a very alive Morn, who takes his usual stool. Quark demands an explanation. Morn starts to open his mouth, but Quark cuts him off, saying he doesn't want to hear it, he's already figured it out: Morn knew that his former associates would come after him as soon as the statute of limitations expired, so he faked his death and pretended to leave his property to Quark, knowing the Ferengi would do whatever it took to get the latinum, and succeed in holding off his four partners until they turned on each other. Morn nods guiltily, confirming Quark's story.

Quark angrily says he could have been killed, and demands to know what really happened to the latinum. Instead of replying, Morn picks up a small glass and regurgitates a small quantity of liquid latinum &ndash; about 100 bricks' worth &ndash; into it. Amazed, Quark realizes that Morn swallowed the latinum and has been carrying it around in his second stomach all these years (which also explains why his hair fell out). Morn pushes the glass to Quark, as fair reward for his help. Quark is more than satisfied, and, intrigued by this scheming, under-handed side of Morn he didn't suspect before, starts to discuss possible joint ventures for the future, such as selling Morn's gold dust, since some primitive cultures still consider it valuable.

0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0," ==Synopsis== The series is reimagined in three distinct animation styles (Black & White Cartoons, 8-bit Video Games, and Japanese Anime).  ==Plot==  ===Part 1: ""Colorama""=== The episode begins in a segment animated in an old black and white cartoon style (particularly those of Disney and Fleischer). This begins with [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] informing the Planet Express of a rare [[Diamondium]] Comet in the vicinity of [[Earth]]. [[Fry]] is trying to find a perfect diamond for a ring he wishes to give to Leela, but he doesn't think one big enough exists. When the crew is sent to collect dust from the comet's tail, Fry finds a part of the comet shaped like a cut diamond but unfortunately diamondium is indestructible. Taking one of Professor Farnsworth's doomsday devices and setting it on the comet, he hopes it will break loose the piece he seeks.  The comet passes in front of the sun causing a rainbow, but the Doomsday Device going off causes half of the comet to break off and drift near the rainbow, causing the creation of an entirely new color (which cannot be seen due to the animation being black and white) and a very small portion of the comet lands on Leela's hand. As Fry kneels down to offer the ring to Leela, she wishes that they could stay in that moment forever and the entire area promptly becomes frozen in solid diamond. The section of the diamond containing Fry and Leela is then shown to be used as the diamond for a ring that an alien uses to propose with.  ===Part 2: ""Future Challenge 3000""=== ''Second Segment: '' The second part of the episode is rendered in the style of an 8-Bit video game. Professor Farnsworth calls the [[Planet Express Crew]] around the table and informs them of a major breakthrough he will soon be able to reach using a lens made from the Diamondium Comet. He holds up the lens but Bender promptly destroys it (causing a ghost to rise from it like traditional game death) however he simply takes out another.  Placing the lens in a microscope he observes a fossilized log very closely and eventually determines the makeup of all life and [[Smallest Matter in the Universe|the answer to the universe]]: all life is made up of pixels. At first Professor Farnsworth is elated that there are no more mysteries to solve, but as time goes on he realizes with no mysteries to solve his job no longer has merit and begins to conclude his life isn't worth living. Close to giving up, Fry offers a question to the Professor: Why do physics work the way they do and not some other way? Realizing this will allow him to research once more he begins to plan for this experiment.  ===Part 3: ""Action Delivery Force""=== The third part of the episode is in an anime style format and begins with an action-oriented scene of the Planet Express crew preparing themselves. A pink race of aliens that communicates only through dancing become enraged when the Diamondium Comet is destroyed by Earth's forces and when the Planet Express tries to communicate they mean no harm to the aliens, their message isn't understood because the aliens only understand dancing.  Fry and Bender try to communicate through a DDR dancing sequence, but unintentionally send a hostile message to the aliens. Then Zoidberg steps up claiming to be able to help. As usual the crew tries to shrug him off but he rises on a pillar and sheds his shell, making his body limber enough to do the complex moves necessary to communicate with the aliens. With peace returned the aliens leave and the adventure is deemed over but the crew is certain that ""We'll be here again at this exact time next week!"" and the episode ends with each of them suddenly donning jet-packs and flying into the sky.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"  ===Episode Summary=== Cynical over the direction of the 20th century, Paul Driscoll (Dana Andrews) solicits the help of his colleague Harvey (Robert F. Simon) and uses a time machine with the noble intention to go back in time and alter past events (in such a way as to minimize the loss of human life) involving the world wars.   Paul first travels to Hiroshima in August 1945 and attempts to warn a Hiroshima police captain (played by James Yagi) about the atomic bomb and tries to convince him to evacuate the city. Paul’s warnings however are dismissed and he is unable to change history. Paul then travels to a Berlin hotel room to assassinate Adolf Hitler (in August 1939 immediately before the outbreak of World War II in September 1939), but his plans are interrupted when a hotel housekeeper knocks on his door and later calls two SS guards to his room causing him to leave 1939 before assassinating Hitler.   On his third journey to the past, Paul tries to change the course of Lusitania to avoid being torpedoed (by a World War I German U-boat), but is unable to do so when the ship’s captain (played by Tudor Owen) questions his believability. Paul accepts the hypothesis that the past cannot be changed.   He then uses the time machine to journey to the town of Homeville, Indiana in 1881 (with the intention of escaping and living out a quiet, uncomplicated life). He then realizes that President James A. Garfield will get shot the next day. However, he allows the assassination to happen. While in 1881, Paul stays at a boarding house in town and meets Abigail Sloan (Patricia Breslin), a fellow resident and teacher at Homeville’s schoolhouse. At one of the boarding house’s dinners, Paul gets into an argument with another boarder over war and imperialism. After reading in a history book that Homeville's schoolhouse will burn down because of a kerosene lantern ejected from a runaway wagon, Paul spots the wagon and attempts to prevent this event from occurring. Instead, he causes the fire he intended to prevent. Afterwards, Paul tells Abigail that “the past is sacred” and returns to his own time, having learned not to tamper with the past. "
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"== Summary == === Teaser === [[Major]] [[Kira Nerys|Kira]] is helping [[Odo]] reorganize his living quarters. Odo ponders on how much, as a solid, he enjoyed sleeping in a bed. Kira suggests that if he enjoyed it so much he should keep the bed and continue using it. Odo points out, however, that he reverts to a gelatinous state when he falls asleep and slides off the bed, so keeping it would be pointless. Kira then stumbles upon a [[PADD]] entitled ''[[Finding and Winning your Perfect Mate]]'' by [[Dr.]] [[Jennings Rain]]. Odo snatches the PADD away and lowers his head, trying to explain its purpose. Kira suggests that he continue reading the PADD, given that he is a solid 18 hours a day. Dax contacts Odo over the comm, asking he and Kira come to [[Operations center|Ops]].  A [[Gamma Quadrant]] listening post has just picked up an encoded [[Cardassian]] transmission. Unable to decode the transmission, Odo suggests allowing [[Elim Garak]] to attempt to decrypt the transmission. At the station's [[Replimat]] some time after, Garak explains to [[Tora Ziyal]] and [[Dr.]] {{dis|Julian Bashir|Changeling|Bashir}} that the transmission was nothing more than a five-year-old [[planetary survey]] report. Garak brushes off the transmission as unimportant. Bashir responds that he is surprised that Garak isn't at all enthusiastic about a Cardassian transmission coming from the Gamma Quadrant, considering it could have been from the survivors of the [[Battle of the Omarion Nebula|joint Cardassian-Romulan attack fleet]] that was lost there.  Garak states that he has long given up on the idea of finding any survivors, to which Ziyal states ""''I never saw you as the giving-up type.''"" Then Garak sneaks on board the [[Federation]] [[Danube class|runabout]] {{USS|Rubicon}}; as he approaches the controls one of the chairs swivels around to reveal Bashir pointing a [[phaser]] at the tailor. ""''Going somewhere?''"" the doctor asks pointedly.  === Act One === ""''I really must remember to stop underestimating you,''"" says Garak, who then reveals that the transmission was really a distress call from [[Enabran Tain]], the former head of the [[Obsidian Order]]. The Cardassian tailor admits that he and Tain were ""very close,"" and despite their tumultuous history, feels obliged to find him. Garak offers to bring Bashir along with him on this rescue mission. Bashir appears to agree at first, but then aims the phaser back at Garak and orders him to come with him to [[Captain]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]]'s office.  Standing in front of Sisko's desk in his office, Garak reveals that the transmission code sequence was designed by Tain and himself. No one else could decrypt it. Garak portrays his rescue attempt as a ""mission of mercy,"" suggesting to Sisko that there might be other survivors of [[Dominion]] attacks imprisoned with Tain &ndash; including Federation citizens. Sisko is still naturally suspicious, but agrees to let Garak go… but only if {{Commander}} [[Worf]] goes along with him.   In his quarters on the {{USS|Defiant|2370}}, [[Jadzia Dax|Dax]] is furious that Worf did not inform her of his involvement in Garak's mission. Worf brushes it off, saying it would not be the Klingon way to ""explain why [he] chooses to face danger, not even to his ''[[par'Mach'kai]]''."" Dax's anger changes to nonchalance as she takes Worf's [[Klingon opera]]s, intending to enjoy them while he is away. Worf seems perturbed by the thought, worried that Dax might misplace them. They then kiss passionately and Dax coyly invites him to hurry back.  Over at [[Quark's]], Tora Ziyal tries to express her feelings for Garak but the tailor simply brushes it off, embarrassed. Nonetheless, he promises that no matter what happens, he ""will come back."" They share a moment before it is interrupted by a furious [[Dukat]], who rushes in and threatens to throw Garak over the railing if he ever touches Ziyal again. Despite Garak's snide remarks, Quark intervenes and threatens to call security while Ziyal pleads with her father, who finally relents. Garak, seemingly unaffected by the whole incident, chips in a final retort and says, ""''You do have a lovely daughter; she must take after [[Tora Naprem|her mother]].''"" Dukat explains to Ziyal that he is here for repairs and to spend time with her. Looking in Garak's general direction, he continues, ""''I can see we have a lot to talk about.''""  Sisko accompanies Worf to the [[airlock]], reiterating that this is a reconnaissance mission and to avoid Dominion ships at all costs. Worf doesn't seem too happy about working with Garak, remarking to Sisko that at the first sign of betrayal, he will kill him. Sisko assumes Worf is joking, to which he states ""''We will see.''""  === Act Two === While on their way through the Gamma Quadrant, Garak tries his best to convince Worf to support his application to [[Starfleet Academy]]. Worf finally gives in, only to realize the Cardassian fooled him the whole time. Garak points out that lying, as any skill, must be practiced constantly.  Dukat confronts Major Kira, accusing her of betraying him by letting Ziyal fraternize with a personal enemy of his. He swears never to forget it; Kira only replies that ""''if that's a threat, I'm not impressed.''""   Worf stops the runabout, having decided that the source of the signal is too deep in Dominion space and that the risk of stumbling over [[Jem'Hadar]] forces is too high. Garak manages to convince Worf that by going through an interstellar [[nebula]], they can come closer to the source without appearing on the Jem'Hadar's sensors. However, shortly after they enter the nebula, a large Dominion fleet appears. ""''Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all,''"" Garak ruefully notes.  === Act Three === Worf tries to get away from the armada by employing evasive maneuvers, but the runabout is trapped in a [[tractor beam]]. Garak tells Worf to [[Polarized hull plating|repolarize the hull]], but they are then boarded by a group of Jem'Hadar soldiers.  Garak approaches the boarding party and says, ""''Are we glad to see you! Could one of you point us in the direction of the wormhole?''"" and is knocked down by a Jem'Hadar's [[plasma rifle]].  Dax and Kira talk about [[Kirayoshi O'Brien]]'s progress in recognizing people only [[The Begotten (episode)|a month]] after his birth when a distress signal from Worf arrives. They can only understand part of it, but the words ""Jem'Hadar,"" ""buildup,"" and ""imminent,"" together with the fact that two of Starfleet's [[listening post]]s in the Gamma Quadrant are suddenly destroyed, makes everyone realize that the long-feared Dominion invasion is about to begin. Sisko orders Dax to notify Starfleet, put the station on [[yellow alert]] and ""make sure everyone knows this is not a drill."" He then sends Kira and the USS ''Defiant'' to the Gamma Quadrant to find Worf.  Garak and Worf are beamed inside [[Internment Camp 371]], a Dominion [[penal colony|prison facility]] located on an [[asteroid]] [[orbit]]ing a [[gas giant]]. [[Ikat'ika]], the Jem'Hadar first in charge of the camp identifies them as enemies of the Dominion and points out that there is no other release from his facility than [[death]].  === Act Four === Another listening post is destroyed and a ship exits the wormhole. It turns out to be the ''Defiant''. Sisko hails Kira and asks her what she found. ""''Trouble'',"" she simply answers.  Gul Dukat meets his daughter in front of the [[Bajoran shrine]]. He tells Ziyal that a Dominion fleet will arrive soon and that he wants her to leave for [[Cardassia Prime|Cardassia]]. She is visibly unhappy about that decision.   Worf and Garak are confined to Barracks 6, where they meet [[General]] [[Martok]], a high-ranking Klingon officer who had been [[Apocalypse Rising (episode)|replaced]] by a [[Changeling]] {{dis|Martok|Changeling|impostor}} [[2371|two years]] earlier. The General, who has lost his left eye, is being used as an opponent in brutal hand-to-hand combat training for the Jem'Hadar. Ikat'ika ends the match but tells Worf, for him, it's just beginning. It turns out Martok has been waiting for them, as has Enabran Tain, who is in bad health and only has days to live due to heart problems. He greets them roughly, which does not seem to surprise a bitter Garak, who says he would have at least hoped for something like ""thank you, Elim."" Tain replies that all Garak did was to doom them both.  Dukat arrives to a briefing with DS9's senior staff in the [[wardroom]] where Sisko makes it clear that the Dominion have picked the perfect time to invade the Alpha Quadrant: the [[Klingon-Cardassian War|war with the Klingons]] and the frequent skirmishes with the [[Maquis]] has left the Cardassian military in shambles, the [[Battle of the Omarion Nebula|failed Obsidian Order/Tal Shiar invasion of the Founders homeworld in the Omarion Nebula]] has left the [[Romulan Star Empire|Romulan Empire]] not much better off and between the [[Federation-Klingon War (2372-73)|hostilities with the Klingons]] and the recent [[Battle of Sector 001|Borg invasion of Federation space]], Starfleet is spread very thin as well. The only chance to fight back the Jem'Hadar invasion fleet, Sisko believes, is to seal the wormhole without damaging it or harming the [[Prophet]]s, by using a series of phase-conjugate [[graviton beam]]s (a method invented by [[Trill]] [[scientist]] [[Lenara Kahn]]). Kira objects to the sealing of the Celestial Temple, but she agrees when Sisko reminds her that if the Dominion invasion fleet arrives [[Bajor]] will almost certainly be their first target.   Martok informs the newly arrived prisoners that Tain modified the [[life support system]] of their prison cell to send the [[subspace message]] to Cardassia, when a female [[Romulan 24th 371 prisoner 001|Romulan prisoner]] arrives and tells Martok that ""he"" has been released from isolation. Worf asks who she is talking about, to which Martok replies: ""''A friend.''"" A few seconds later, a Jem'Hadar pushes another prisoner, a Human, who is wearing the previous uniform style, into the room, who, to Garak's and Worf's great astonishment, turns out to be Dr. [[Julian Bashir]].  === Act Five === Bashir performs a [[blood screening]] on himself to prove to his fellow inmates that he is not a [[Changeling]], although everyone knows that the screenings aren't totally trustworthy anymore. Bashir lets them know that it is all they can go on for right now. After that, he describes how he went to sleep after attending a [[burn]] treatment [[Meezan IV Conference|conference]] over a month ago on [[Meezan IV]] and woke up in the internment camp the next morning. Martok describes how the same happened to him after he was abducted from [[Qo'noS]] while hunting [[saber bear]] on [[Kang's Summit]], and expresses disdain towards the Changeling who replaced him, calling it a ""grave dishonor"" to have had so many Klingons die because of his double. Worf assures the general that none of the dishonor is his, as Bashir worries about what the Changeling who replaced him on the station is up to. Worf says they must find a way to warn Captain Sisko before the Changeling can carry out whatever mission he has.  This very Changeling arrives at Ops in a [[turbolift]] at the same time, bringing [[sandwich]]es for Dax and O'Brien, who are working on the modifications on the graviton emitter controls. He tells them to let him know if they need anything.  Dukat is waiting in front of an airlock when Ziyal arrives and tells him that she will not leave DS9. Her father gets furious, telling her that things on Cardassia will change soon and that Garak is probably dead already. Ziyal still refuses to go, so Dukat rushes off, telling her to ""stay here and be damned.""  Martok informs Garak that if there is anything left he wants to say to Tain, he'd better do it soon. Garak and Bashir make their way to their prison cell, where Tain has already gone blind. He asks Garak if they're alone, and Garak lies about Bashir's presence, telling Tain that there's no-one else there. Tain then asks Garak [[Shri-tal|about his enemies]], to which his former protégé assures him that they have all been taken care of. Tain then advises him to stay alive and avenge his death. Garak says he will do so if he asks him this favor not as a mentor or a superior officer, but as a father. Tain replies that he is not his son, but Garak interrupts him: ""''Father, you're dying. For once in your life, speak the truth.''"" Tain finally admits the truth, talking of his regret that he didn't kill Garak before he was born as he always regarded him as a weakness. Garak begs for Tain to allow him to be his son even if only for a few moments. Tain recalls a day in the country when a five-year old Garak kept falling off a riding hound but never gave up and kept getting back on, recalling that despite everything he was very proud of him that day (""the only day,"" according to Garak). Tain finally dies, and Garak tells Bashir and Worf that his business in the camp has finished. The three then start planning their escape.  Meanwhile, all the Gamma Quadrant listening posts have been destroyed meaning the Dominion invasion is imminent. With no time left and, despite knowing they're trapping Worf and Garak in the Gamma Quadrant, the DS9 crew tries to seal the wormhole. ""''May the Prophets forgive us,''"" Kira quietly says. However the station's [[graviton emitter|graviton emitter array]] has been sabotaged and fails to destabilize the wormhole's graviton matrix. The wormhole opens moments later and a massive Dominion fleet enters the [[Alpha Quadrant]]…  :[[By Inferno's Light (episode)|TO BE CONTINUED&hellip;]] "

His wife, friends, co-workers, and mother all deny knowing him. He is placed in an insane asylum, where his doctor, Koslenko, tells him that David Gurney doesn't exist, and is only a delusional construct. Gurney deems this impossible since he has extensive memories of his life and the people he knows, and becomes convinced that someone wants to blot him out. He jumps through the window of the asylum, steals a van, and goes searching for evidence of his identity. He finds a photograph of him holding his wife, and says that the photo and its date disprove his wife's claim that she never saw him before. However, when the police arrive with the psychiatrist, the picture has somehow changed and portrays Gurney alone, inexplicably grasping thin air. He throws himself to the ground and wakes up in his bed. The whole adventure was a bad dream. His wife gets up from the bed and talks to him from the bathroom, where she removes cream from her face. When she emerges, Gurney is horrified to discover that, even though she acts and talks the same way, his wife does not look at all like the wife he knows. "
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"==Summary== === Teaser === [[Counselor]] [[Deanna Troi|Troi]] enters her [[quarters]] after what appears to be an exhausting day. She begins to read three [[letter]]s from [[Lwaxana Troi|her mother]], ignoring a research inquiry originating in [[Canada]] from the ''[[Manitoba Journal of Interplanetary Psychology]]'' and plans on having a ""''real''"" [[chocolate sundae]] from her [[replicator]] (which unfortunately cannot create it without very clear description) when she is called by [[Captain]] [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] to attend a reception in [[Ten Forward]] for delegates negotiating for the rights to the [[Barzan wormhole]], which is about to appear visibly. After attempting to beg off, she reluctantly heads to Ten Forward, muttering sarcastically to herself about not wanting to miss seeing a wormhole.  Once arriving, Picard introduces her to Premier [[Bhavani]] of [[Barzan II]] and two of the [[negotiator]]s: [[Mendoza]] of the [[Federation]] and [[Leyor]] of the [[Caldonian]]s. Then the third negotiator, [[Devinoni Ral]], a [[Human]] representing the [[Chrysalian]]s, introduces himself. Troi seems immediately drawn to Ral, who has an [[Rojay|attractive female companion]] on his arm. Those gathered then turn their attention out the forward [[viewport|windows]], where the Barzan wormhole &ndash; the only stable wormhole known to exist &ndash; makes itself visible, as it does every 233 minutes. Troi then turns to Ral, who is looking at her with interest, as Bhavani tells the competitors that the wormhole is theirs &ndash; for the right price.  === Act One === :""''[[Captain's log]], [[Stardate]] 43385.6. We are orbiting Barzan II, which is entertaining bids for control of what appears to be a stable wormhole, which could provide a permanent shortcut to the distant [[Gamma Quadrant]].''""  Since the [[Barzan]]s don't have the means to administer the wormhole's use, they are offering that right to interested spacefaring races and groups. Just as the negotiations start in the [[conference lounge]], [[Commander]] [[William T. Riker|Riker]] informs them that a [[Ferengi]] delegation wants to be included. Bhavani admits that she was not expecting the Ferengi, but does not wish to incur any ill will. Picard has [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]] beam the Ferengi party directly to the conference room. Their leader, [[DaiMon]] [[Goss]], begins by protesting at not being invited, then demands [[chair]]s for himself and his two consuls, Dr. [[Arridor]] and {{dis|Kol|Ferengi}}. Picard (keeping his temper with difficulty), informs the DaiMon that all the parties have agreed to limit their delegations to one representative, that the two Ferengi counsels are welcome to accommodations aboard the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-D|-D}}, and Picard will vacate his own chair for Goss. Goss says they can handle the pleasantries later; taking a large bag from Kol, he opens it on the table to display a pile of [[gold]], confidently predicting that he can outbid anyone else at the table.   Back in her office, Troi is researching Ral. She discovers that he was born on [[Earth]] in [[2325]] in [[Brussels]] in the [[European Alliance]] but moved to [[Hurkos III]] when he was 19. Her door chime sounds, and Ral enters. He begins a flirtatious conversation with Troi, during which he informs her that his traveling companion is now ""traveling."" He then begins rather forwardly stroking Troi's hair, removing the [[hair clip]] she had in it. She protests slightly, but Ral silences her and then invites her to dinner at 8:00.   === Act Two ===  In Picard's [[captain's ready room|ready room]], Picard, Riker, [[Data]], and Mendoza are reviewing the data from the Barzans' unmanned [[probe]] sent into the wormhole, which indicates that the other end exits near the [[Denkiri Arm]], in the [[Gamma Quadrant]]. Picard gives a low [[Whistling|whistle]]: a distance that would take nearly a hundred years at [[Warp drive|warp 9]] to traverse, covered in a matter of seconds through the wormhole. Riker has some reservations; a ""stable"" wormhole is an unknown beast in the [[galaxy]], and Picard agrees that, for all the eagerness of the other parties, the Federation should hesitate before bidding its resources to acquire ""''the proverbial [[lemon]],''"" a term which Data attempts to gain some clarification. Picard tells him they will discuss it later.  Mendoza notes that, for all of Goss' bluster, the Ferengi don't have the resources needed to whet the Barzans' interest. Riker agrees, guessing that Ral, the most relaxed competitor at the table, is the one to worry about. Mendoza agrees, shrewdly guessing that Riker is a [[poker]] enthusiast.  La Forge and Data volunteer to man a [[Type 15 shuttlepod|shuttlepod]] to gather more meaningful information. Picard agrees, and says they may do so the next day, after taking more readings on the Barzan side of the wormhole.   In the Ferengis' quarters, Dr. Arridor is helping Goss set up a ""[[poison]] [[handshake]]"" that will make whoever he grasps have a severe [[allergy|allergic reaction]], albeit non-fatal, in order to remove the competition in the negotiations. They cackle at their ingenuity.   At 8:00, Ral arrives at Troi's quarters. She invites him in for a [[drink]], but he steals a [[kiss]] before she can order. She turns away, unsure of why she's so drawn to him and what she may do. She then orders [[champagne]] from the [[replicator]]; Ral appends the order ""for two."" Troi then admits that she's been constantly thinking of Ral, and steps forward and kisses him deeply. Troi breaks the kiss, stating that they'll be late for dinner. Ral then lifts her into his arms and states, ""very late.""  Mendoza is staggering down the hallway, obviously a victim of Goss' handshake. He stumbles into [[sickbay]], and collapses. Dr. [[Beverly Crusher|Crusher]] and [[Martinez]] rush forward to help him.  In Picard's ready room, the Ferengi are arguing with the captain and Riker about their plans to explore the wormhole. Picard offers to share their data, but Goss is skeptical, so Riker angrily suggests they send their own probe and Goss says he will, which apparently is what he planned to do. After the Ferengi storm out, Picard tells Riker to instruct Data and La Forge to stay out of the Ferengi's way on their shared probe mission. As Riker leaves, the doctor calls and asks for the captain to come to sickbay.  Dr. Crusher tells Picard that Mendoza is having a [[histamine|histaminic]] reaction and won't be able to return to the negotiations for several days. Picard and Riker leave, where Picard tells Riker that he'll have to take over for Mendoza. Riker protests, but Picard points out that he, Picard, is the host and cannot step in without causing an awkward transition. However, Mendoza had already noted Riker's poker skills, and all he's doing is stepping into the game as the stakes are raised. Picard notes that that is when the game gets interesting before stepping into a [[turbolift]] to leave Riker with that thought.  === Act Three ===  Data and La Forge ready themselves in a [[shuttlepod]] to enter the wormhole at the same time that Arridor and Kol are doing the same in their [[Arridor's shuttle|pod]]. The opening of the wormhole appears, and Picard orders them to proceed. The Ferengi follow the shuttle in. Communications are quickly lost between the shuttle and the ''Enterprise'' as it rapidly travels across [[Milky Way Galaxy|the galaxy]].  In the conference lounge, Ral is trying to undermine Riker's confidence as a negotiator, but Riker counters him well. Ral then continues his case for his clients, stating that the Chrysalians may not be as powerful as ""''the mighty Federation''"", but they have the resources and technology to make the Barzans' prosperous, and they have also had peace with all species for ten generations &ndash; something the Federation cannot claim.  Later in Troi's quarters, Ral and Troi are having an intimate discussion about their developing relationship. Ral asks about Riker and Troi, and she admits that although they are friends now, they were once much closer. Troi then presses Ral about himself. Ral admits to her that he is also part [[Betazoid]]; he is one-quarter, Troi is one-half. Ral was the only child out of five with [[empathic ability|empathic abilities]]. He says this is why he left Earth, because it was difficult having empathic powers while others didn't. He then received training so he could handle them.   At the other opening of the wormhole, the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s shuttle and the Ferengi pod arrive. La Forge tries to be cordial with the Ferengi, but Arridor rudely dismisses him. Data then notices that they are not where the Barzan probe's data indicated; they are 200 [[Light year|light years]] away from where the probe emerged, well within the [[Delta Quadrant]], and 70,000 light years from Barzan II.   La Forge wonders if the probe's readings were false, and Data speculates that this far end of the wormhole is unstable, moving about while the other end is anchored in the [[Alpha Quadrant]], and that the probe didn't discover this as it must have arrived at a different location, the Gamma Quadrant. La Forge detects heightened [[Quantum level|subatomic]] activity with his [[VISOR]] in the now-invisible wormhole opening, and Data detects increased [[gravity|gravitational]] changes. La Forge notes that there is something strange happening with this wormhole.  === Act Four ===  While preparing for a [[gymnastics]] session, Crusher and Troi spend a few minutes giddily discussing Deanna's budding relationship with Ral. Troi says that she feels ""''out of control''"", as she is both concerned and happy, and there is nothing rational about it. She also says that she is worried that she will lose herself as she can't get enough of Ral. Crusher assures her that their relationship is similar to her own with another man she fell in love with for one day before she met [[Jack R. Crusher|Jack]]. Troi wonders if she should try and relax, which both women disagree.  In Ten Forward, Goss is making (unsuccessful) passes at a female crewmember at the bar. Ral is talking with Leyor about his people's motivations for administering the wormhole, since the Caladonians are more renowned for their [[scholar]]ly pursuits. Leyor admits that he's uneasy about taking on the responsibility of administering the wormhole. At the next session of the negotiations, Leyor suddenly withdraws his people's stake.  Riker immediately asks to negotiate with the Caldonians for their resources to be added onto the Federation's offer. But Leyor reveals that the Caldonians have already negotiated such an arrangement with Ral's clients. Riker voices his suspicions, but Ral coolly says it was just a matter of timing. He then adds the Caldonians' assets to the Chrysalians'.   Back in the Delta Quadrant, La Forge and Data are trying to convince Arridor that the wormhole is unstable, and that they should all return immediately, but the imprudent Ferengi dismisses them again, despite La Forge's reminder of them being 70,000 light years from their ships. With no other choice, La Forge and Data enter the wormhole before it is visible, returning to the Alpha Quadrant. After they leave, Arridor chuckles to Kol that they quickly panicked, and the wormhole becomes visible again, right where he predicted. But before they can enter, the wormhole's opening immediately zips away, proving that it really is unstable, leaving Arridor and Kol with their [[mouth]]s agape, [[False Profits (episode)|stranded in the Delta Quadrant]].  That evening, Troi and Ral are having [[dinner]] in her quarters. Troi says everyone's talking about Ral's ''coup'' and that Riker didn't know how it happened. Ral says that Riker is ""''the most dangerous man in the room.''"" Troi then accuses him of using his empathic powers to unfairly read his competitors' [[emotion]]s to gain negotiating advantage. Ral disagrees with her assessment, saying he uses that plus reading body language, just like any other good negotiator. Troi then says that he hides his empathic powers not because they make others uncomfortable, but because they are his secret tool to outmaneuver his opponents. Ral replies that she does the same, which Troi says as she to help others, not manipulate them, and she doesn't hide that she's an empath. Frustrated, Ral asks her if she announces to every alien culture she encounters that she's an empath and if she would use it to her side's advantage when engaged in battle, to which Troi says she would, but only for protection to the crew &ndash; a different reason. But Ral says that's her edge because it's a matter of life and death when she takes the advantage. Ral, on the other hand deals in property and exchanges and no body gets hurt from it. He then asks her which of them has a problem with ethics and then leaves.  ===Act Five===  Later that evening in Ten Forward, Ral sits with Riker and compliments him on his negotiation skills. But Ral says it is in the last round of negotiations that the stakes become highest, and only those willing to take the biggest risks will succeed. Ral, for instance, confides that he is willing to commit his clients to owning the wormhole before the Federation and Ferengi explorations return with more data &ndash; can Riker say the same? Riker is silent.  Ral then further needles Riker, hinting at his intimacies with Troi, saying he'll take her away from Riker and the ''Enterprise'', because Riker was not attentive enough. At that, Riker smiles, chiding Ral for making his first ""''bad play''"".  Riker says that if being with Ral makes Troi happy, then he's all for it. He then needles back, saying that Ral isn't such a bad fellow, but he is, at heart, a [[mercenary]], with nothing to value or look forward to except his next deal. Riker can attest, from experience, that Deanna is just the sort of woman who could bring some meaning to Ral's sorry life &ndash; if Ral is the sort of man with the wit to realize it, but ""''I doubt that you are.''"" Riker drinks to the ""last mile"" of the negotiations and leaves Ten Forward.  The next day, Ral and Riker are back at the negotiating table, but DaiMon Goss has left the ''Enterprise''. He's gone back to his ship, and complains that the Federation has not acted fairly, that they already have an agreement with the Barzan. Picard denies this, but Goss fires a [[missile]] at the wormhole to destroy it. Worf destroys it with a quick [[phaser]] shot. The ''Enterprise'' goes to [[red alert]], drawing Riker out of the negotiations. Ral then takes this opportunity to point out that the Federation-Ferengi power play wouldn't be an issue if his clients were the wormhole's administrators.   Goss continues to threaten to destroy the wormhole, but Troi says he's lying, almost unequivocally. Ral and Bhavani then enter the bridge, where Ral offers to quell Goss' anger. He says he's come to an agreement with the Barzan on behalf of the Chrysalians, and that he's willing to allow Ferengi free access to the wormhole if he stands down, in exchange for trade concessions to the Chrysalians to be negotiated later. Goss accepts, and Bhavani apologizes to Riker for negotiating behind his back, but she realized that the Chrysalians' long tradition of peace makes them a much more desirable partner than the Federation.  Troi, though, speaks up, revealing Ral's empathic powers and how he manipulates his opponents, and guessing (correctly), that the minor upset was a piece of theater arranged between Ral and Goss to tip Bhavani towards Ral's side. Among other things, she sensed a complete absence of tension from either Ral or Goss during the confrontation. Goss begins to protest, and Picard orders the communication off.   [[Wesley Crusher]] then announces that the shuttle is returning from the wormhole. La Forge [[hail]]s them, saying he's reporting in, though just barely. Picard asks where the Ferengi pod is, and La Forge informs them that the Ferengi are stuck in the Delta Quadrant. Data explains that the other end of the wormhole periodically shifts, and that eventually the Alpha Quadrant end will shift too &ndash; the wormhole is not stable at all, and is indeed worthless. Bhavani sags &ndash; whatever short-term gains her people will receive from the Chrysalians, the wormhole will not usher in the new age of prosperity she was fervently hoping for.  [[Worf]] announces that DaiMon Goss is hailing, demanding to know where his men are. Picard instructs Worf to tell Goss that if he heads for the Delta Quadrant, he'll be able to meet up with them in about eighty years or so.  Riker cannot resist ""congratulating"" Ral on his ""victory"" in the negotiations. Ral does his best to smile, saying he wouldn't take the risks if he wasn't prepared to lose, and will stand by his clients' new commitments to the Barzans.   Ral makes a final visit to Troi, saying that he's being recalled by the [[Chrysalian]]s to address their questions about now owning a worthless wormhole. Troi offers a half-hearted apology, and he shrugs, saying his services have been valuable to them in the past, enough that he can be reasonably sure nothing really unpleasant will be done to him.  He admits to her that he read Bhavani's desire to contract with the Federation and had to act on that. She then tells him that she was obligated to let everyone know the nature of his skills once he did that. Ral admits that he now sees the error of his ways, and he asks Troi to run away with him, to be his conscience. She turns him down, saying she already has a job as a counselor. He leaves without another word. "

A frozen Wall Street investor from the 1980s, known as ""That Guy"", takes over control of Planet Express and tries to sell it to Mom.

==Plot==
[[Planet Express]] holds its stockholders' meeting, and the state of the business is not good. Uninterested in the meeting, [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] and [[John A. Zoidberg|Dr. Zoidberg]] wander off in search of food. Fry finds his way into a cryogenic defrostee support group meeting, where he meets a sleazy [[#Cultural References|Gordon Gekko]]-esque 1980s businessman referred to only as ""[[Steve Castle|That Guy]]"", who froze himself to await a cure for his terminal bone-itis.

Fry and That Guy return to the Planet Express stockholders' meeting, where a revolt against [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] is in progress. Fry nominates That Guy to be the new CEO; That Guy gets one vote more than Farnsworth and takes over Planet Express. That Guy names Fry his new Vice Chairman and sets out to remake Planet Express by giving it an expensive image overhaul.

That Guy's business strategy proves to be the acquisition of flying chairs, expensive suits, and an enigmatic television commercial, which is a reference to the 1984 Macintosh commercial. Fry is impressed, the rest of the crew is appalled, and Zoidberg is hungry; he sells his stock to That Guy for a sandwich. After draining the company's funds and its employees' morale, That Guy announces that he is selling Planet Express to [[Carol Miller|Mom]].

The takeover, ostensibly a shareholder's meeting, begins at the orbiting Intergalactic Stock Exchange, and all the Planet Express employees vote against it. That Guy's vote tips the scales to 51% in favor; his sandwich-bought pile of shares, it is revealed, had been requisitioned to Zoidberg by [[Hermes Conrad|Hermes]] in lieu of toilet paper when the shares were worthless. The shares are now worth a huge sum, and the crew contemplate the loss of their company and the gaining of incredible wealth, save for Zoidberg, who is left to contemplate the worth of his sandwich. Before the final approval of the merger takes place, That Guy's uncured bone-itis enters its final stage, causing his body to contort and bones snap, twist and curl. That Guy bemoans that he had been so busy ""being an 80s guy"", he had forgotten to get it treated.

Fry gains control of That Guy's shares, and moves to vote against the merger. The Planet Express staff initially tries to convince him to sell the company, because the sale of their stock will make them all rich. However, the very speech that Fry gives to announce his new plans for the company drives the stock's price through the floor. Since the staff will be poor no matter what he does, he votes against the merger.

He is immediately taken into custody and questioned by the American base commander General Harper and his provost marshal, Major Wilson. The two men ask Decker if he was trying to make a film or was part of an air show. Decker identifies himself and his squadron and informs the American officers that the day is March 5, 1917. He is then informed that the day is not actually March 5, 1917, but March 5, 1959, and Decker realizes that he traveled 42 years into the future.  Decker tells the officers that he and his comrade Alexander Mackaye were fighting seven German aircraft and that Mackaye died. He refuses to believe that Mackaye is alive and has become an Air Vice Marshal in the Royal Air Force, as the American officers inform him. Mackaye had been a hero during World War II, saving thousands of lives from German bombing. The Americans also ask Decker if he knew that Mackaye was actually coming to inspect the base that day. Major Wilson tries to help Decker remember what happened.   Decker does eventually recall, confessing that throughout his service, he had acted as a coward, only pretending to do his duty and managing to go off on his own during patrols. Only now that he and Mackaye were confronted by a large number of German aircraft, Decker had chosen to escape rather than support Mackaye. He refuses to believe that Mackaye somehow escaped with his life.  An off-hand suggestion made by Wilson (that perhaps someone else helped him) makes Decker realize that he has been given a second chance. He tells the American officer that there was no one within 50 miles who could have come to help Mackaye, so if Mackaye survived, it had to be because he went back himself. Decker pleads with Wilson to release him from custody, but when he is refused, he escapes after assaulting Wilson and a guard. Decker manages to locate and start his plane, but is approached by a mechanic whilst climbing aboard but manages to punch him to the ground. Decker is about to take off when Wilson catches up and puts a gun to his head.   Decker begs to be allowed to go, as saving Mackaye would also mean saving thousands of lives that Mackaye had saved during World War II. Decker also tells Wilson to shoot if he wants to, but this was an opportunity for him to redeem himself from his previous cowardice. Wilson thus allows him to escape, and Decker flies his plane into the white clouds.  Major Wilson is rebuked for letting Decker go, but when Air Vice Marshal Mackaye arrives, they immediately discuss what must have happened. Mackaye says that Decker had saved his life by helping him fight the German planes that day. Although initially he feared Decker had deserted him, Mackaye says Decker returned from out of nowhere to shoot down three German planes, before he was shot down himself. General Harper now shows Mackaye the badge and personal effects of Decker which had been confiscated, upon which Mackaye informed them that these had never been returned by the Germans. When Mackaye demands to know what is going on, Major Wilson suggests that he sit down, calling him ""Old Leadbottom"" which was Decker's nickname for his old friend. ""What did you call me?"" Mackaye asks incredulously (no one outside his squadron knew that nickname), as we see the clouds outside the General's window.  "

==Summary==
===Introduction===
January 8, [[2259]]

Aboard the [[EAS Agamemnon|EAS ''Agamemnon'']], Captain [[John Sheridan]] is finishing up a mission repelling hijackers when he receives a communication from General [[William Hague]] of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Hague informs him that a rogue [[Minbari]] warship, the ''[[Tragati]]'', has been sighted numerous times over the past few days, each time in closer proximity to [[Babylon 5]]. Though the Minbari have dispatched a warship to hunt for it, Hague wants Sheridan at Babylon 5 in case the ''Tragati'' arrives with hostile intentions. Hague explains, however, that he does not simply want Sheridan to command the ''Agamemnon'' in conjunction with B5 &ndash; the [[President of the Earth Alliance|President]] has other instructions in mind.

On Babylon 5, Lt. Comm. [[Susan Ivanova]] records a log entry, detailing how she has been left in charge of the station ever since Commander [[Jeffrey Sinclair|Sinclair]] was recalled to [[Earth]] five days previously. Security Chief [[Michael Garibaldi]] remains in critical condition in [[Medlab]], and Ambassador [[Delenn]] remains inside a chrysalis. General Hague contacts her on [[Gold Channel]] to deliver some surprising news: Commander Sinclair will not be returning, as he has been permanently reassigned.

===Act I===
General Hague explains that Sinclair has been reassigned as the new Earth ambassador to [[Minbar]], having been personally requested by the Minbari. He informs Ivanova that Captain Sheridan will be the new station commander. Ivanova is surprised, though having served under Sheridan before she is familiar with him.

A Minbari named [[Hedronn]] (a member of the [[Grey Council]]) arrives at Delenn's quarters, and sees for himself what she has undertaken. He explains to [[Lennier]] (still praying vigilantly nearby) that the ''[[Tragati]]'' has been sighted in the sector. He orders Lennier to go to the humans and tell them what he has been told should the ''Tragati'' turn up.

Captain Sheridan arrives unexpectedly ahead of schedule, and [[David Corwin|Corwin]] immediately informs Ivanova. Ivanova rushes down to greet him at customs and turns over command of the station to him. She then begins giving a tour of the station and explaining about some of the more serious (or just outright strange) events going on, such as Garibaldi and Delenn's respective conditions, and how Ambassador [[G'Kar]] has vanished. Sheridan is enthusiastic about his new assignment.

A Minbari warrior arrives on the station and pulls up a map of the station. When he sees [[Green Sector]], he immediately sets out for it.

Ivanova shows Sheridan his quarters. She takes the opportunity to ask why he of all people was assigned to replace Sinclair. Sheridan explains that he was [[Luis Santiago|the late President]]'s first choice to replace Sinclair should anything happen. While commanding the ''Agamemnon'', he had the opportunity to work with numerous members of the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]], in addition to the [[Narn]] and the [[Centauri]]. Ivanova asks about the Minbari, aware that Sheridan is still disfavored among them (still calling him by the epithet ""Star Killer""). Sheridan hopes they will be more or less over it after twelve years. Ivanova also explains how stressed out she has been the past week with everything going on and how happy she is that he is there. Before she leaves, he mentions to her he plans on giving his ""good luck speech"" in [[C'n'C]], the same speech he always gives when taking a new assignment.

Hedronn notices the Minbari warrior and recognizes him as [[Kalain]]. He confronts Kalain, and the warrior threatens Hedronn: he is aware that Sheridan ""Star Killer"" has been assigned to the station, which he calls an obscenity. He warns Hedronn to leave the station immediately if he values his life.

===Act II===
As part of what has become a regular routine, Ivanova goes to [[Medlab]] to check on Garibaldi. Dr. [[Stephen Franklin|Franklin]] has no update: Garibaldi remains stable but comatose.

Sheridan arrives in C'n'C and begins to deliver his good luck speech. He expresses his confidence in the crew during the speech. He is interrupted by a link from Security, informing the captain that a Minbari is demanding to speak to him about a matter concerning the safety of the station.

Kalain saunters into Green Sector, but is stopped by a security guard who asks to see his [[identicard]]. Kalain knocks the guard out and continues on his way.

Hedronn meets with Sheridan and Ivanova in Sheridan's office. He explains how he has seen Kalain, who was second-in-command aboard a Minbari cruiser during the [[Earth-Minbari War]] and who has not been seen since the end of the war. Sheridan correctly assumes that the cruiser in question was the ''Tragati''. They explain to Ivanova that the captain of the ''Tragati'', [[Sineval]], committed suicide rather than comply with the surrender order. Kalain assumed command and the ship went rogue, believing they had been betrayed by the Grey Council, and have existed the last twelve years in self imposed exile. When Sheridan asks how Hedronn was able to recognize Kalain (correctly assuming that Hedronn is a member of the Grey Council, despite not identifying himself as such), Hedronn mentions that he does not recognize Sheridan's authority. Sheridan defends his appointment, saying that the President felt the Minbari had previously had too much influence over an Earth station. Hedronn makes it clear that his people have not forgotten about the ''Black Star'' and stalks off. Ivanova asks him about how he destroyed the ''Black Star''. Sheridan explains how during the War, the Minbari had a kind of stealth technology that prevented conventional weapons lock. So he came up with the idea of mining an asteroid belt with fusion bombs, which succeeded in taking out the ''Black Star'' and three other heavy cruisers.

Just then, it occurs to Sheridan that if Kalain feels his world has betrayed him, he might be aboard to go after the representative of that world: Delenn.

===Act III===
Kalain, inside Delenn's quarters, orders Lennier to move aside. Lennier stands his ground, even when Kalain draws a PPG on him. Sheridan and a security team arrives moments later, and Kalain peacefully surrenders to them. Sheridan introduces himself to Lennier, who explains that Delenn is currently ""indisposed.""

Sheridan personally decides to interrogate Kalain about his presence on the station. He finds it odd that Kalain did not kill Lennier and Delenn when he easily had the chance. Kalain does not offer any answers, though he accuses Sheridan of being the real problem.

After the interrogation, Lennier approaches Sheridan and asks to talk to him about a number of sensitive issues &ndash; including why the Minbari surrendered at the [[Battle of the Line]]. In Sheridan's office, Lennier divulges the truth to Sheridan and Ivanova. The Grey Council had come to oversee the final victory. Delenn ordered a [[Starfury]] captured so its pilot could be interrogated. The fighter that was captured turned out to belong to Sinclair. He was brought aboard, beaten, and during the course of his interrogation, they discovered something terrible: Sinclair had a Minbari soul. They brought aboard other humans and confirmed that other humans also had Minbari souls. This led them to believe that Minbari souls are being reborn in human bodies, and so the War was ended to prevent further destruction of Minbari souls. However, understanding the sensitive nature of this discovery, the Grey Council kept this information hidden from their own people. Lennier explains that he has been instructed to tell them this secret because ""changes are coming.""

At that moment, the ''Tragati'' comes through the [[jump gate]] &ndash; and its weapons ports are open.

===Act IV===
Lt. [[Warren Keffer]] is enjoying a holo-letter from home when he is alerted to the presence of the Minbari cruiser.

Sheridan and Ivanova head to C'n'C and sound a Red Alert, scrambling [[Starfury]] wings. They manage to hail the ''Tragati''. [[Deeron]] of the ''Tragati'' demands Kalain be released to them. She launches a fighter wing of her own. Sheridan warns that an attack on the station will be considered an act of war, but she simply replies that the only thing left is ""honor and death."" Sheridan worries what this could mean and links to Security. They confirm that Kalain is dead, having committed suicide in his cell: obviously the ''Tragati'' is trying to provoke them to attack. Sheridan orders the station's fighters to engage the incoming fighters. However, when he realizes that the Minbari are not implementing their stealth technology, he orders the Starfuries to hold position. He then has Ivanova send a narrow band transmission through the jump gate.

The Minbari fighters pass right by the Starfuries without firing a shot. They loop back and return to the ''Tragati''. As they do, a second Minbari war cruiser enters local space. Sheridan explains that he was aware of the Minbari government sending a ship out to search for the ''Tragati''. He correctly assumed that the ship was waiting in hyperspace until it heard of an attack, so that was why he sent a transmission through the gate. The ''Tragati'' is ordered to surrender, but refuses. Before it can escape, the second ship destroys its engines. The ''Tragati'' then self-destructs with all hands. The captain of the war cruiser, [[Vastor]], contacts Sheridan, and assures him that his involvement will not be forgotten.

Later in his quarters, Sheridan is visited by Ivanova. He confesses doubts about being assigned to the station. He mentions that he has spoken to the President, who is also aware of the Minbari's ""soul transfer"" explanation. Sheridan does not believe the story, but clearly understands that the Minbari believe it (which explains why they wanted Sinclair). Ivanova reassures him, telling him he should not second guess himself.

Lennier returns to his vigil, talking aloud to the cocoon. He expresses his regret that he could not tell Sheridan the whole truth: that a great enemy is returning and that the ""two halves of our spirit must unite or be destroyed."" After he leaves, the chrysalis begins to crack.

===Act V===
Ivanova, Franklin, and Keffer enjoy a few drinks late that evening. Sheridan is supposed to meet them, but first he has one last thing to do: he delivers his ""good luck speech,"" though given the time C'n'C is empty.

==Synopsis==
Longing to fit in at work, awkward [[Stacey Chapman|Stacey]] begins to use a popular lotion that causes an alarming reaction, while an unnerving transformation takes shape.

==Plot==
===Stacey===
Awkward and socially reclusive, [[Stacey Chapman|Stacey Elizabeth Chapman]] does not fit in with her co-workers at the bank where she works. She finds herself ill-at-ease with their vain gossip and beauty-obsessed culture, spending her time outside of work with her husband [[Keith Chapman|Keith]], working on taxidermy, or watching late night television programs and infomercials.

During the holidays, Stacey receives an unexpected invitation to the Secret Santa party being held at the home of her co-worker [[Gina Kapov]]. Returning home, she excitedly reports to the news to her husband, who is confused because it has always seemed to him as though she hates her co-workers. He says it's rude of them to have only just now invited her to a party after her having worked there for so long, but she tells him that's just the way women are. She gets to work on her Secret Santa gift: a life-like taxidermy duck.

At the party, Stacey is confused when the Secret Santa aspect of the party turns out to be not-so-secret. Rather than handing out a customized gift for her intended recipient, Gina instead presents all of the other women there with a bottle of [[Alo Glo]], an expensive and popular beauty lotion that is heavily promoted on television commercials and retails for a hugely expensive price. Stacey is then embarrassed when Gina seems more creeped out than anything by her taxidermy duck gift and her story of how she personally hunted and then stuffed the duck.

The other women all go back to discussing the lotion, seemingly putting the duck out of their minds. They begin applying it, rubbing it deep into their faces. Wanting to fit in, Stacey does so as well, but her face quickly breaks out into a terrible red rash. Stacey is sent home with an ice-pack for her face. She apologizes to Gina for ruining everything, but Gina tells her that she didn't, that it's fine. She says that it's cold outside and she should go home.

===The pitchman===
Back at home, Stacey laments to Keith that it figures she has to be allergic to the best lotion in the world. Keith counters that if it were really the best, it wouldn't do that to her face. He tells her that she just has sensitive skin. She replies that she has a bad face, but he tells her that it's enough of that. Late that night, she sits watching television and ends up seeing an ad for Alo Glo. The [[Alo Glo Man|attractive pitchman]] states that you can transform yourself from ugly duckling to a stunning swan for just $199.99. As the ad continues, it seems as if he is speaking directly to Stacey, stating that she can make sure that ""those ladies at the bank never laugh at you again."" She wonders what is happening and then he outright speaks to her, asking ""Come on Stacey, isn't this what you've always wanted?"" The [[Alo Glo Beautiful Assistant|woman]] with him then describes side effects such as ""internal emptiness"" and ""lack of individualization,"" then tells Stacey ""but it's all worth it.""

""I'm not talking to the TV,"" comments Stacey, but the man tells her that she's talking to him. He tells her that he can give her a brand-new her. She objects that the lotion stings and is making her itchy. He, however, tells her that skin itches when it is healing, so the more her skin itches, the more healing that it is doing. He tells her that she will soon have everything she has always dreamed of and to step to the other side. She picks up the phone and places an order for an entire case of the lotion.

===The Lotion Woman===
That morning, Stacey calls in sick to work. The red rash on her face is getting worse, but she nevertheless continues to use the lotion. Kevin tells her that it looks really bad, but she says that it mostly just itches. He tells her that she should stop using it, but parroting something that the man on the TV said, she tells him that it's a process and that it heals when it itches. He says that the lotion companies just make money from telling that something is wrong with you, but she says that something is wrong with her. He says that if something is wrong with her, something must be wrong with him too. She tells him that he's a man and that men can be fat and ugly and more and nobody cares. She tells him that she's changing and to be supportive of her. Meanwhile, elsewhere, the lotion squelches from the bottle, seemingly of its own accord.

Stacey starts scratching her skin in her sleep. Kevin insists that she start wearing oven mitts. Later, she ends up speaking to the Alo Glo Man on the television again. He tells her to go all the way and to trust him. She asks him if it will hurt and he asks if it hurts when people exclude her. He tells her that the new life she wants is already growing under her skin and to use more Alo Glo.

Stacey gives in and continues using the lotion. Her skin starts to flake and peel. She goes to Kevin, telling him that she knows what he's going to say. Sure enough, he tells her that it's going worse and that they need to go see the doctor. She tells him that it's in her skin and it's growing, that this is how it works. She says it will fix her, but he tells her that she doesn't need to be fixed, that she is lovely inside and out. She moves to leave and he asks she is going, telling her she'd better not be using more of the lotion. She goes down to the basement and encounters a [[Lotion Woman|strange woman]] made entirely of the lotion who seems to mirror her movements. The two of them caress, kiss and make out.

===The transformation===
Stacey returns upstairs, where Keith, seeing her covered in the lotion, asks just what has gotten into her. She tells him that he shouldn't judge people, that it's negative and mean. He tells her that she's kind, funny and beautiful and that she's perfect as she is. She shouts at him that he doesn't understand what's happening to her and that ""she"" is already there. She says he's not going to change and doesn't want her to change. She stabs him in the face, then beans in the back of the head with an ax. She returns downstairs and makes out with the Lotion Woman again. The woman then goes to the bathtub and oozes inside it. Stacey undresses, then submerges herself completely in the lotion. She emerges from the tub and the lotion itself as if leaving a cocoon. Her skins is completely clear and she is gorgeous. She goes back upstairs to Keith, telling him to look, but he is dead. She taxidermies his body, then poses him as if he is watching television.

Stacey cuts her hair short, dyes it, and puts makeup on her face. She dons a glamorous dress and sunglasses, then heads into work. Everyone there is stunned by her transformation, the security guard barely recognizing her at first. The other women agree that it's like a mirage in a desert. They tell her she looks gorgeous. When they ask her what's different, she says only that she cut her hair. Seemingly fully transformed, she joins them in their vapid gossip, even sharing an anecdote of her own. She laughs and laughs, but as the conversation continues, the laughter seems more forced and she looks troubled and confused.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0," == Summary == === Teaser === :""''We, the people of Earth, greet you in a spirit of peace and humility. As we venture out of our solar system, we hope to earn the trust and friendship of other worlds.''""  A small craft of some kind flies by at impulse speeds, as ""[[Friendship 1]]"" can be read on its [[hull]].  In a small control room on an [[alien]] [[planet]], two people are desperately working to identify the craft. It begins transmitting a musical composition, ''[[The Four Seasons]]''. They try to locate its position, as they realize it has just begun entering their [[atmosphere]].  === Act One === In [[astrometrics]], [[Captain]] [[Kathryn Janeway|Janeway]] is talking to [[Starfleet]] [[Vice Admiral]] [[Hendricks]] about the various species of the Delta Quadrant, particulary the [[Voth]]. He instructs her to retrieve the ''Friendship 1'' probe, which Starfleet believes to be in the Delta Quadrant. She convenes a meeting in the briefing room with her senior officers. They discuss the probe's programming, and intent.  :""''Captain's Log, [[Stardate]] 54775.4. We've been searching for five days without any sign of the probe. But we're not about to disappoint Starfleet on our first official assignment in seven years.''""  On the [[bridge]], [[Harry Kim]] reports that there are no signs of ''Friendship 1'' in the current search grid. Kim requests to move the search to [[grid 310]] as he has compensated for several solar winds and local anomalies that would have adjusted the probe's trajectory in the quadrant. They locate a titanium signal in the northern subcontinent of a planet in that grid, just 2 [[light year]]s away. In astrometrics, they are unable to localize the probe as there is a large amount of [[antimatter radiation]]. Captain Janeway sends an [[away team]] to retrieve the probe. She assigns [[Chakotay]], [[Tom Paris]], Harry Kim, [[Joe Carey]], and [[Neelix]]. They must all get [[inoculation]]s in [[sickbay]] first. [[B'Elanna Torres]] wants to go on the trip as well, but Paris talks her out of it because she is six months pregnant and she and the [[Miral Paris|baby]] would be breathing a [[toxic]] [[atmosphere]]. Torres only agrees after Paris agrees to carry the next baby.  On the ''{{dis|Delta Flyer|2377}}'', the away team is headed through the upper atmosphere of the planet, where they encounter severe turbulence. When they come through the cloud deck, they notice the planet was inhabited at one point, but it looked as though it was in the midst of a [[nuclear winter]]. As the ship sets down, a man in a suit scans the ship from rocks in the distance.  === Act Two === On the planet, the [[away team]] are in [[Environmental suit|EVA suits]]. Chakotay and Kim discover antimatter missile silos, while inside a cave Paris, Neelix, and Carey find remnants of the probe. Neelix hears something, but Carey can't read any [[life sign]]s on his [[tricorder]]. Just then, Paris, Neelix and Carey are ambushed and captured by the [[Otrin's species|planet's natives]]. Chakotay and Kim return to the ''Flyer'', where Kim is attacked by one of the natives who was searching the ship. After he stuns the intruder, the ''Flyer'' comes under attack from antimatter weapons. Chakotay has no choice but to fly the ship back to ''Voyager'', leaving their three crewmates behind. Paris, Neelix and Carey are taken prisoner and injured by the natives until their leader tells them to stop. The leader then asks who they are, what they have, and why they are here. Paris tells them that they are from ''Voyager'' and that they came to retrieve the probe. The leader responds they should have come sooner, that it would have spared his people the suffering it caused.  Janeway is receiving an update from Chakotay when [[Tuvok]] contacts her from the [[bridge]]. Tuvok says that they are receiving a [[subspace]] transmission from the surface. A man named [[Verin]] tells a confused Janeway that she will pay for what [[Earth]] did to the planet's people. Verin wants Janeway to take him and his people off the planet to a new home or he will kill the away team. He gives Janeway three hours to begin the evacuation.  === Act Three === Janeway tells Tuvok to scan for M-class planets, as just an option. Janeway and Chakotay head to sickbay where they talk to the native they stunned on the ''Delta Flyer''. The man, [[Otrin]], a [[scientist]], says that he was attempting to get information from the ''Flyer''{{'}}s computers that could undo the damage Earth caused. Janeway asks the scientist to explain how they are responsible for his world's destruction. The scientist says that a containment failure in their antimatter power grid destroyed their planet. But until the Friendship One probe arrived, the natives had never conceived of antimatter. His feeling was that Earth's intent was to have their planet adapt to using antimatter technology in the hopes that their civilization would destroy itself. Otrin thinks ''Voyager'' is there to conquer their planet. Janeway assures him that ''Voyager'' is not here to conquer his world.  Back on the planet, Carey is feared to have a concussion and Paris asks to treat him. A pregnant woman refuses to allow Paris to use his equipment. During the ensuing conversation, Paris deduces that she is pregnant and tells her how his wife is expecting a [[Miral Paris|baby girl]]. Paris also finds that the woman has had two boys and a girl, but they were all stillborn. Paris says that the best doctor in the quadrant is on ''Voyager'', but she stops talking to him.   In astrometrics, Janeway learns the nearest M-class planet is 132 light years away. This would take seventeen trips and nearly three years to complete the relocation of the nearly 5,500 people on the planet. Janeway won't stop her trip back to Earth for that long. Tuvok states that the only other option may be to rescue the hostages by force. Janeway doesn't want to reinforce the thought that [[Human]]s are violent unless it's absolutely necessary. Meanwhile, [[Seven of Nine]] helps to treat the native scientist by extracting [[nanoprobe]]s from her bloodstream.  Back on the planet, a girl talks to Neelix and Paris. They want to give the girl a toy they found on the planet. Verin hears the toy and snatches it away, thinking it is a weapon. He tells the child to stay away because they're dangerous. Neelix attempts to negotiate with Verin, asking if he can talk to Janeway on his behalf. He shares that his home, the moon [[Rinax]], was destroyed by the [[metreon cascade]] and his family was killed. Verin replies, ""''I'm sorry about what happened to your family. But don't compare your life to mine'',"" and sends Neelix back to holding.  Janeway attempts to further negotiate with Verin. He discusses an alternative to relocating the entire planet's population. She suggests working together with [[Otrin]] to have a shorter-term solution as flying to the other planet would take too long. Verin still doesn't believe Janeway, as she hasn't given him any reason to trust her. She offers to send a supply of food and medicine in exchange for a hostage. Verin agrees and allows Carey to set up the [[transporter enhancer|transport enhancers]] to transport him off the planet, but before the [[transporter]] locks on, Verin tells Carey that he's sorry and shoots him with a [[disruptor]], killing him.  === Act Four === Captain Janeway holds her ground on the bridge, telling Verin that killing one of her crewmen will not make them any more receptive to their demands. When Verin threatens to kill the others, Captain Janeway agrees to transport their people, but says she requires time because the transporters weren't designed to handle large groups. Verin gives her one hour and ends the transmission. Janeway calls Chakotay to her [[Captain's ready room|ready room]] to begin a plan, immediately.  Back in sickbay, the first phase of Otrin's [[nanoprobe]] treatment is working. Seven tells Otrin that the group on the planet needs a more open-minded leadership.  The pregnant woman on the planet begins having early contractions. Paris offers to help, and she gives birth to a boy. He isn't breathing. Paris revives him using a [[cortical stimulator]]. Meanwhile, the ''Delta Flyer'' returns to rescue the crew. Verin thinks Tuvok has been captured, but his captor is actually The Doctor. The Doctor hands Tuvok his [[phaser]], and then he stuns everyone with weapons in the room, surprising Neelix and Paris (The Doctor had been dressed as a native, but being a hologram protected him from the effects of the radiation and allowed him to play the part.) Tuvok and The Doctor rescue Neelix and Paris. Before they beam up, Paris convinces the mother to take her son to ''Voyager'' because he won't survive for very long in the atmosphere.  ===Act Five===  The baby is safe in sickbay. Janeway decides to transport him back to the planet along with a set of food and medical supplies. Neelix and Paris plead with Janeway to help the people on the planet to make up for what their ancestors on Earth did. In [[engineering]], Otrin performs a successful experiment to remove the antimatter radiation. Janeway offers a plan to use [[photon torpedo]]es to eliminate the radiation in the atmosphere. ''Voyager'' will be put at extreme risk because it will require low-altitude detonations of the torpedoes and the reaction would expand exponentially. Janeway orders shield modifications to help the ship survive. The procedure begins, and massive atmospheric explosions rock the surface.    Back underground, Verin is becoming increasingly paranoid that the explosions from the photon torpedoes in the atmosphere will destroy the remaining survivors, rather than clear the pollution, and brings the antimatter warheads on-line to fight back. Otrin attempts to persuade Verin to let ''Voyager'' help, but Verin pushes him aside and continues to set the antimatter weapons. That is, until the once-pregnant woman draws an energy rifle on him. Shocked, Verin asks, ""What are you doing?"" The woman replies, ""I won't let you ruin our only chance for survival."" He asks if she would kill him just to stop him. The reasoning of the woman is clear: ""To save my child, yes."" Verin orders her weapon taken away, but one by one, the survivors start to reject Verin's leadership. Trying to recover the power that is quickly slipping through his fingers, he claims ""I've kept you alive! ''ALL OF YOU!''"" Otrin counters that survival isn't enough to live anymore. Verin tries in vain to regain his leadership, but fails, and the entire group stands behind Otrin in defiance. However, the best news to the group arrives when a child comes in telling everyone to hurry outside. With Verin under guard, the group goes outside the cave to find the sky clearing.  :""''Captain's log, supplemental. We've retrieved ''Friendship 1'' and resumed our course for the [[Alpha Quadrant]], but the success of our mission had a very high price.''""   Chakotay enters Carey's quarters and finds Captain Janeway looking at a [[ship in a bottle]] model of ''Voyager''. Carey only had one [[nacelle]] to go before finishing it. Chakotay and Janeway then have a debate about the moral implications of the launchers of ''Friendship 1''. The benefits of exploration don't justify the loss of lives &ndash; whether it's millions or just one.  "
0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0," ==Summary== ===Teaser=== While [[Commander]] [[Chakotay]] and an [[away team]], including [[Joe Carey|Carey]] and [[Neelix]], are on a scouting expedition on an [[Unnamed Delta Quadrant planets#Leola root planet|alien]] [[planet]], {{Lieutenant}} [[Tom Paris]], onboard the {{USS|Voyager}}, notices something from his [[helm console|station]] that may be a [[cloak]]ed ship. [[Tuvok]] reveals it is in fact a ship using some kind of masking circuitry unfamiliar to him. He suggests using a [[polaron]] burst; when [[Captain]] [[Kathryn Janeway|Janeway]] gives him the go-ahead, the burst reveals the outline of a [[Kazon raider|Kazon]] [[Kazon warship 001|warship]], the specifications of which conform to the [[Kazon-Nistrim]] sect. Janeway immediately orders the away team back to the ship.   On the surface, Chakotay assembles the away team, but there is no sign of [[Seska]]. He has the rest of the team [[beam]] back aboard ''Voyager'' while he looks for her with a [[Starfleet tricorder|tricorder]] in hand in some nearby caves. He finds her picking [[mushroom]]s so she can teach Neelix how to make Chakotay's favorite [[soup]]. As they move to leave the cave, they are surprised by a pair of Kazon soldiers. Chakotay is injured in the firefight, and Seska helps him out of the cave to the transport site.  ===Act One=== :""''[[Captain's log, USS Voyager, 2371|Captain's log]], [[Stardate]] 48658.2. We've successfully left [[orbit]] without further interference from the Kazon. Commander Chakotay is injured but is recovering from his wounds.''""  Seska visits Chakotay's [[quarters]] bringing him [[mushroom soup]]. They savor it together as she describes how Neelix wanted to make the soup with leola root. She goes on to explain how thanks to an altercation she describes as a 'Maquis operation' with {{dis|Jackson|Crewman}} stealing the [[mushroom]]s and some other food from the [[kitchen]] allowed for the [[mushroom soup]] to be made for Chakotay, while Neelix was dealing with a convenient case of homesickness that arose with several other [[Maquis]] officers. Chakotay, visibly upset at her raiding the kitchen and stealing food, revokes all the culprits' [[replicator]] [[ration]]s for two [[day]]s including his own. He also threatens to throw Seska and her co-conspirators in the [[brig]], next time. As Seska leaves, Janeway calls the senior staff to the [[bridge]].  ''Voyager'' receives a [[distress call]] from a ship identical to the one seen at the previous [[planet]], and while the call appears to be genuine based on [[sensor]] readings, Neelix advises caution; the ship hails from the [[Kazon-Nistrim]], one of the most violent sects in the [[Kazon Collective]]. With no indications of other Kazon ships in the vicinity, Janeway plots a course to intercept the ship.   When an away team beams aboard the Kazon ship, they find several bodies on the bridge, all dead from what appears to be a kind of subatomic manipulation that has melded them with pieces of metal. They detect [[nucleonic radiation]] emanating from an area of the bridge, contained automatically via [[force field]]s. One survivor is among the Kazon crew, so he is beamed aboard ''Voyager'' to be treated in [[sickbay]], but the away team finds something strange in the vicinity of the radiation: [[neosorium]], a composite unique to [[Federation]] technology.   Back aboard, The Doctor finds the Kazon's cells have been fundamentally altered and he doesn't know if he can save him. As they head to the bridge, Chakotay and Tuvok tell Janeway of the possible Federation technology aboard the Kazon ship. Tuvok notes three possibilities: either it is not Federation but something similar, or another Starfleet ship has been pulled into the Delta Quadrant, or (most likely) someone from the crew handed the technology over. Janeway immediately halts the turbolift, finding the idea that someone on ''Voyager'' might have given technology to the Kazon very disturbing. Tuvok suggests that Seska might have been responsible since she was found near the Kazon on the planet, but Chakotay points out he found her hiding from them. Janeway tells them that retrieving the console is now top priority and resumes the turbolift.  ===Act Two=== The staff meets in [[engineering]], where [[B'Elanna Torres]] brainstorms possible ways to retrieve the console. Although Seska thinks she can use a '[[subspace]] bubble' to walk through the force field and protect her from the radiation, Torres thinks it is too risky and instead opts for Carey's suggestion to push the force field and the radiation so it no longer intersects with the console. The plan will take until the next day, so they begin to get to work; however, when Torres assigns jobs to the engineering crew, Chakotay claims that he does not want Seska on the engineering team but on the bridge instead.   Seska is upset at Chakotay's decision to pull her away from the engineering team, but Chakotay assures her in a [[corridor]] that he is only trying to protect her; visiting sickbay, she asks [[The Doctor]] to inform her immediately if their Kazon guest wakes up, as he is the only one who can prove her innocence. While she is there, [[Kes]] notes that Seska never got around to giving a [[blood]] sample. Seska tells Kes that her blood cannot be used for [[blood transfusion|transfusion]] due to a childhood disease and she was warned never to donate. The Doctor notes that is all the more reason it should be on file, however Seska simply promises to give a sample later before leaving.   Later, Seska tries to retrieve the console herself by transporting over to the damaged Kazon ship without authorization and using her subspace bubble. On the bridge, Chakotay orders her back, but she refuses and Tuvok points out she may have gone over to destroy evidence that could implicate her. As Chakotay argues back that it is a misguided attempt by Seska to prove herself, the Bajoran is suddenly heard screaming. She is beamed to sickbay, where she is found to be burned but it is easily treatable.  ===Act Three=== Janeway calls Carey into her [[captain's ready room|ready room]], where Tuvok and Chakotay are waiting. They interrogate him about any personal [[communications]] he might have had with the Kazon since ''Voyager'' was stranded in the [[Delta Quadrant]] pointing out he was separated from the away team on the planet for over an hour and may be bitter over Lieutenant Torres being promoted to chief engineer over him. Carey vehemently denies all of the accusations, and although he does mention Seska's name, he stops short of implicating her directly. Janeway has Carey confined to quarters for the rest of the investigation. After he's gone, the three discuss if Carey may actually have betrayed the crew to the Kazon; while he indeed has a motive and had the opportunity to do so, he also has a distinguished Starfleet career while Seska spent two years as an enemy of the Federation. Chakotay however still refuses to accept this, pointing out that he was a Maquis too.   When another Kazon ship arrives, the [[First Maje]] [[Culluh]] of the Kazon-Nistrim introduces himself. Like all Kazon, he is aggressive, but he is intent on protecting Kazon property. Janeway refuses to leave the ship alone until she has the console, using her superior technology as the stick. Culluh agrees to settle for visiting the still-unconscious survivor of the accident.  Culluh and his bodyguard arrive in sickbay, where The Doctor explains about the accident and the nucleonic radiation from the console. The Kazon want to be left alone with the man, so Janeway talks to The Doctor in private, not eager to release their patient into Kazon hands. Janeway prepares to inform the Kazon of her intentions when Culluh's bodyguard takes out a small needle and, before Tuvok can intervene, instantly kills the patient with an injection of [[neurotoxin]]. Disgusted, Janeway orders Culluh and the bodyguard off her ship.  Once the Kazon are gone, [[Kes]] and The Doctor have important news for Janeway: according to Seska's [[blood screening]], she is not [[Bajoran]] but [[Cardassian]].  ===Act Four=== Chakotay is informed of The Doctor's analysis and is incredulous and wants to be the one to question her. Janeway decides to hold off until the console is retrieved. As an away team is preparing to beam over to the vessel to take back the console, the other Kazon ship threatens war if anything is removed. Janeway threatens a harsh tactical response if they interfere, and the Kazon back down.  An away team including Torres manages to successfully beam the console, decontaminate it, and begin analysis in Engineering. Torres identifies the console as a [[food replicator]], however it lacked sufficient shielding to prevent nucleonic radiation from leaking and causing a cascade. It is also identified that the components in the console contain [[bio-neural circuitry]], proving that those components could only have originated from ''Voyager''.  Chakotay confronts Seska in sickbay with the evidence of the food replicator components and the diagnosis that she is believed to actually be [[Cardassian]]. Seska indicates that the reason for this is that she had suffered from [[Orkett's disease]] as a child and received a [[bone marrow]] transplant from a Cardassian woman named [[Kattell]] to survive. Chakotay informs her that an extensive search of security logs is currently underway to identify the traitor.  Once Chakotay leaves sickbay, Tuvok informs him outside the room that Carey has also been told about the pending search and that the trap is now ready to catch the culprit.  ===Act Five=== Chakotay and Tuvok play [[gin rummy|gin]] at a console in [[engineering]] while monitoring the activity of the manifest logs. Upon detecting changes, they find that Seska's security codes are being clumsily planted into the logs, seemingly implicating Carey who would be trying to frame her.  Chakotay enters sickbay to tell Seska what they've found and that they now know for certain who gave the technology to the Kazon… her. Seska denies everything, claiming that she doesn't know what evidence they think they found but Chakotay replies that actually they found the evidence she put out there for them to find: her own security code. He explains their trap and how they were hoping she'd fall for it. She knew no one would believe she could be that careless by typing in her own security code, so that is exactly what she did, hoping that everyone would believe that someone else was trying to frame her. They also managed to trace the fact the information was entered from a console in sickbay. The Doctor also refutes her claim to be the victim of [[Orkett's disease]], having already discounted it before she even mentioned it to them; there is no doubt she is Cardassian.   At that moment, the lights in sickbay go on and Captain Janeway and Tuvok enter. Upon realizing that she has been exposed, Seska finally admits everything. She claims to have done it for Chakotay and for this crew that is alone in [[Delta Quadrant|this part]] of the [[Milky Way Galaxy|galaxy]], at the mercy of any number of hostile aliens because of the incomprehensible decision of a [[Federation]] Captain who destroyed their only chance of getting home. She mocks Federation values and angrily points out that if this were a Cardassian ship, they would be home now, and should forge alliances with powerful allies such as the Kazon Nistrim in exchange for some minor technology. She says that building a base of power in this quadrant at any cost is all that matters, finally pointing out to the captain what a fool she is and what a fool Chakotay is for following her. She escapes ''Voyager'' using a voice-activated transporter program, known as [[Command XJL]], to quickly transfer over to one of the nearby Kazon ships. Attempts to get her back fail, and Janeway quickly realizes that they are going to soon be outnumbered by Kazon ships from all over if they remain. She decides to retreat, knowing that they haven't seen [[Maneuvers (episode)|the last]] of Seska.   Later in the [[mess hall]], Chakotay sits down with Tuvok to discuss Seska's betrayal; he does not understand how Seska, of all people, could fool him to this extent and asks if there was something about him that made it easy for everyone to deceive him. Tuvok reassures Chakotay that he does not strike him as particularly naive, and admits Seska had him fooled as well, and Chakotay &ndash; much to Tuvok's confusion &ndash; begins to feel a bit better about himself.  "
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"  == Summary == === Teaser === On a beautiful [[planet]] in the [[Delta Quadrant]], [[Commander]] [[Chakotay]], and [[Captain]] [[Kathryn Janeway]] are awakened from their [[stasis unit]]s by [[The Doctor]], who reports that they have been in [[stasis]] for seventeen days. He regrets to inform them that, despite all his and [[Kes]]' efforts, he has not discovered a cure for the [[disease]] the two officers have been infected with. It appears that the only way the two officers can avoid developing the deadly symptoms is to remain on the planet, where an unknown element is able to protect them from the disease's effects. He says that the only thing he can think of is contacting the medically advanced [[Vidiian]]s. Janeway terminates the com link to discuss the situation with Chakotay, and both agree that the Vidiians would most likely attack the crew for body parts rather than offer aid. Chakotay asks if they could live with themselves after sending the {{USS|Voyager}} into that kind of danger. Janeway's implied answer is no.  Janeway hails [[Lieutenant]] [[Tuvok]] and asks him if he had heard The Doctor's report. When Tuvok replies that he has, Janeway informs him that she is turning over command of ''Voyager'' to him on a permanent basis. She orders him to set a course for the [[Alpha Quadrant]], and, despite what The Doctor says, not to contact the Vidiians. Tuvok acknowledges that he understood Janeway's orders. Janeway informs Tuvok that she will prepare a message for the crew.  === Act One ===  Tuvok, {{Lieutenant}}s [[B'Elanna Torres]] and [[Tom Paris]], Kes, [[Neelix]], and [[Ensign]] [[Harry Kim]] discuss the captain's final order to leave them behind while in a meeting in the [[briefing room]]. Torres and Paris are understandably and vocally distraught at the prospect, while Kes informs everyone that The Doctor has not deactivated himself for a month trying all possibilities for a cure and that he cannot be at fault. Neelix states that crew morale will suffer ""if we leave them behind."" Tuvok asserts that it is not a matter of if, but of when they leave the captain and Chakotay behind, as the decision has already been made. Tuvok assures the crew that they will have all the technological comforts they will need, and that the captain, ""an able scientist,"" will continue to work on a cure for their virus. Should she succeed, they have a [[Type 9 shuttlecraft|Type 9]] [[Class 2 shuttle 003|shuttlecraft]] at their disposal. Paris scoffs that at a [[top speed]] of [[warp factor|warp 4]], it will take them seven hundred years to get home. Throughout the entire exchange, Kim is silent and dejected, and remains in his seat after Tuvok dismisses the staff.  Janeway and Chakotay begin to pick around at their things transported to them. She lists of a dizzying array of research equipment with determined optimism, assuring Chakotay that she is confident of finding a cure. Chakotay begins carrying their makeshift shelter over, and asks her which way she wanted it. She says to put the gray on the outside and the beige on the inside, because she has always looked better in beige. Janeway states that it might be fun to rough it for a while. Chakotay remarks that they have shelter, furniture, [[Starfleet tricorder|tricorders]], and a [[replicator]] but jokes that it's still too rough for him. Janeway replies that they do not, however, have a bathtub, and when Chakotay inquires as to what she means, she says that a bath is her favorite way of relaxing. She also tells him that, since they aren't in a command structure any more, that he should call her Kathryn. A little unnerved, he tells her that she should give him a few days on that.  Back on ''Voyager'' in [[engineering]], Torres is harshly critiquing Ensign [[Swinn]] on a report, telling the ensign that it reads like it was written by a first year [[Starfleet Academy]] [[cadet]], there are numerous errors, and it is incomplete. The ensign tries to defend herself by saying she has been a little distracted. Torres says that is no excuse and dismisses Swinn. Kim approaches and defends the ensign, saying that everyone has been a little distracted by recent events. Torres replies that as their situation cannot be changed, the best thing to do is to ""''take a deep breath and move on.''"" Kim is upset by Torres' words and walks away.  Chakotay is secretly building something in the woods, which arouses Janeway's curiosity. Just then, Tuvok contacts them to say they are about to go out of communications range. Janeway gives a brief farewell to the crew. Tuvok remarks that he was honored to have served with both of them and asks the captain and commander to ""''live long and prosper.''""  === Act Two ===  Day 24 on the planet, Janeway is taking a bath in the tub that Chakotay built in the woods and her voice informs us that she and Chakotay have dubbed the planet as [[New Earth]]. Meanwhile, a rustling around their [[modular shelter]] startles her. She calls for Chakotay who rushes outside with a [[phaser]] and a [[SIMs beacon]]. He aims the light from the beacon at the rustling sound and they discover a [[New Earth primate|primate]]. She claims she wants to get it to approach her so she can study its physiology (since it surely has to contend with insect bites) although Chakotay remarks that she's trying to take the chance to get a pet.   Six weeks after leaving Janeway and Chakotay behind (according to Tuvok's log), ''Voyager'' picks up a Vidiian convoy on long-range scans. The crew discuss whether or not to [[hail]] them. Tuvok decides to maintain the current heading and not contact the Vidiians since they were directly ordered not to. Kim begins to argue about whether or not they should be leaving the two on the planet. Tuvok relieves him of duty and threatens to throw him in the [[brig]] if he does not leave the [[bridge]]. At Paris's urging, Kim leaves.   Kim, [[Hogan]], Swinn, Torres, and Neelix discuss what happened in the [[mess hall]] and realize the majority of the crew disagree with Tuvok's orders. Kim then goes to Tuvok's quarters at 0100 hours to discuss what happened earlier with Tuvok, and recommends future actions with the Vidiians reminding him that [[Lifesigns (episode)|their previous encounter]] with [[Danara Pel]] means she would likely help them, and Torres' [[Klingon]] DNA could be used as barter as it is resistant to the [[Phage]]. However, Tuvok is adamant with his decisions, also pointing out their [[Deadlock (episode)|previous responsibility in destroying]] a Vidiian ship of 300. He tells Kim that ""The safety of this crew is paramount, and I must do whatever I can to ensure that safety."" He tells Kim that if he ever questions his orders again, he will be relieved of duty permanently.  === Act Three === Showing Janeway and Chakotay on the planet, Janeway expresses her concern with Chakotay's increasing closeness and feels as though he has given up. That it seems as though he is more focused on making a home than on finding a cure. He responds ""''I cannot sacrifice the present for a future that may never happen.''"" Janeway says someday she may have to accept that there is no cure, but not today.  As Janeway heads into the forest to check her traps, she sees the same primate while collecting insect samples. As the primate begins shrieking a warning, however Janeway first thinks the primate is looking at her traps, the primate points towards the sky. the weather changes violently with dark clouds and a [[plasma storm]], causing Janeway to fall several times as she makes her way back to the shelter.  Back on the ship, Kes meets privately with Tuvok to try explain the feelings of the crew. She tells him more about [[Benaren|her father]], and says that he is the reason she left her city and eventually came to ''Voyager''. Tuvok says that then they owe him a debt, as he could not imagine this journey without Kes. Kes goes on to say that her father died when she was one, and she missed him terribly, but knowing Tuvok helped reduce the pain of that loss. He says he is honored by the comparison. Kes reminds him that as captain, he is responsible for the emotional as well as the physical well-being of his crew. Tuvok says he cannot be held hostage to the crew's feelings.   He tells Kes she is wrong if she thinks he doesn't realize their loss. ""''I have lost a valued friend, and I am not immune to the effects of that loss.''"" Kes asks him to imagine the effect of that loss ""on those of us who feel things deeply."" She tells him much of the crew is waiting on the bridge for him to explain further.  Tuvok and Kes go to the bridge where about a dozen crew members are assembled, including Kim, Paris, Torres, and Neelix. Tuvok says that no one can appreciate the burdens of command until it falls on them. ""''I believe that in general it demonstrates faulty leadership to be guided by the emotions of a distraught crew. However, as captain, I must not ignore the sensibilities of those I command.''"" He tells them he has decided to set a course for the Vidiian convoy. He takes full responsibility for the decision and absolves the crew from any consequences for failing to obey Janeway's orders.  The plasma storm on New Earth has damaged much of the structure they live in. Chakotay holds Janeway as debris falls around them. When the storm clears, Janeway and Chakotay head outside with tricorders and find extensive damage. Janeway's research has been destroyed and she says she will not be able to continue it. Chakotay says he's sorry. Janeway sighs, and tells him, ""''Well, that's one way of letting go.''""  === Act Four === On ''Voyager'', Tuvok's log gives the stardate being 49694.2 and reports that the convoy has agreed to contact Dr. Pel to see if she can help them.   Dr. Pel eventually communicates with ''Voyager ''and tells Tuvok she is familiar with the planet, which is now 70 light-years away, and the disease and agrees to provide an antiviral serum developed by the Vidiians. The Vidiian ship she's aboard will rendezvous with ''Voyager'' in about twenty hours. As a precaution, Tuvok plans for the crew to undergo battle drills prior to their contact.  As Janeway and Chakotay are clearing the branches, Chakotay discusses building additional rooms out of lumber. He says he built a few log cabins as a boy. [[Kolopak|His father]] felt it was important. Janeway says her family used to go camping. ""''No bed, no replicator&hellip; no bathtub. I hated it. I guess I was always a child of the 24th century.''"" Chakotay suggests the camping trips helped prepare her for life here. She says this place is much better than the camping trips and he smiles and remarks that's the first time she's said anything positive about New Earth.  They see the primate again and Janeway says she senses intelligence in him and believes he tried to warn her about the plasma storm. Chakotay says he doubts the primate can be domesticated. Janeway says they have the rest of their lives to try.   Inside, Chakotay massages Janeway because of her sore [[neck]]. He says he's had a lot of practice because his mother used to get a sore neck and he was the only one she trusted not to make it worse. After a minute or two, Janeway steps back and formally says good night.  When ''Voyager'' meets the Vidiian ship at the set location, the crew finds out that three Vidiian ships have prepared an ambush.  The next morning on New Earth, Janeway expresses her concern by suggesting they define parameters between the two. Chakotay tells a story about a [[Fictional Humans 002|male warrior]] who is asked by a [[Fictional Humans 002|female warrior]] to join her tribe, and how he learns to put her needs first. She asks him if the story is really ""an ancient legend."" He admits it isn't, but introducing it that way ""just made it easier to say."" They both smile and touch hands across the table.  === Act Five === As the Vidiians attack ''Voyager'', Tuvok gives the command to fire back using [[photon torpedo]]es. The battle continues, and injured crewmembers are being brought to sickbay. The Doctor receives an odd message on the monitor, then realizes it isn't coming from inside ''Voyager''. It is Danara Pel. She calls him [[Shmullus]] and says she was unaware of the planned attack. The Doctor asks if she is safe, and she says yes, the Vidiian crew is too busy with the battle to realize she is contacting him in this fashion. She has the antiviral serum, but ''Voyager'' will have to lower shields to receive it.  The Doctor calls Tuvok on the bridge to discuss the serum. Tuvok gives precise orders for the next steps. ''Voyager'' will drop [[shields]] long enough for The Doctor to [[beam]] the medicine aboard, and at the same moment Torres will eject an [[antimatter]] container. As soon as the antimatter container is clear and the serum is received, the shields will be raised again and Kim will fire a torpedo to detonate the antimatter, while Paris simultaneously moves the ship at full [[impulse drive|impulse]] to avoid the explosion. Tuvok reminds everyone that timing will be critical and asks if anyone involved in the plan has questions or requires clarification.   Everyone performs their tasks. As ''Voyager'' moves away, the explosion disables the Vidiian ships. At warp 6, ''Voyager'' heads back to New Earth.  On New Earth, Janeway is planting [[Talaxian tomato]]es when Chakotay comes out to ask her for an opinion on a boat he plans on building. She shows him the tomato plants. Chakotay asks her if she hated gardening as well as camping when she was a child. She says yes, ""''Who wanted to be mucking about in the dirt when we could be studying quantum mechanics? But I find it very satisfying now&hellip;''"" They go inside to look at the plans for the boat, and hear a com signal from ''Voyager''. Tuvok, through the com link, states that they have the medicine needed to treat their condition on board and will arrive in thirty hours.   They pack everything up. The primate appears, and Janeway says goodbye, telling it to feel free to use their shelter.  On board ''Voyager'', Tuvok explains what happened and apologizes for disobeying her orders. Janeway smiles and says, ""''If I didn't know you better, I'd say your decision was almost&hellip; emotional.''"" She thanks the crew and then she and Chakotay discuss ship's status, back in their formal roles as captain and first officer. Janeway orders Paris to leave at warp 8. "
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"==Summary== ===Teaser===  The {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701}} approaches the [[planet]] [[Exo III]] to learn the fate of [[Dr.]] [[Roger Korby]], a prominent [[scientist]] whose last message was sent over [[2261|five years earlier]]. Two previous expeditions have failed to uncover any trace of the Korby expedition.  Despite the odds, Korby and at least part of his expedition have survived by taking refuge in underground ruins left by the former inhabitants of the planet. [[Lieutenant]] [[Nyota Uhura|Uhura]] picks up a transmission from Korby on the planet's surface, surprising the ''Enterprise'' crew.  ===Act One=== Korby requests that [[Captain]] [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]] [[beam]] down alone, explaining that he has made discoveries that may require an extraordinary decision on Kirk's part. But when he learns [[Christine Chapel]], his former [[fiancée]], is aboard, he readily agrees for her to accompany Kirk.   Kirk and Chapel beam down, but are met by no-one, so Kirk has two [[security officer]]s beam down as well. One security officer, [[Rayburn]], is instructed to remain at the beam-down location while Kirk, Chapel, and the other security officer, [[Mathews]], explore the ancient ruins, searching for Korby. Shortly after they meet Dr. {{dis|Brown|android}}, Dr. Korby's [[assistant]], Mathews falls into a ""bottomless"" [[cave]]rn, leaving Kirk and Chapel alone. Unseen by them, a massive, Human-like figure moves away further into the cave system. Dr. Brown seems somewhat detached and aloof, barely reacting to Mathews' tragic fall. He also seems slow to recognize Chapel. Kirk contacts Rayburn at the cave entrance, informing him of Mathews' death and telling him to remain where he is and tell Spock to put a full security party on standby. But before Rayburn can carry out this order, he is attacked by the figure from the caves. Making their way through the winding cavern, Dr. Brown explains that the previous civilization that inhabited Exo III moved underground when their sun went dark. He elaborates that the inhabitants replaced freedom with a mechanistic culture and claims that once Dr. Korby is freed from the cavernous environment they are currently in, the discoveries he has made will revolutionize the [[universe]]. The group then enters an area furnished like a living room, which would appear to be the Korby expedition's living quarters. Inside, they also meet [[Andrea]], a beautiful woman who wears a revealing blue and green jumpsuit.   Kirk meets Korby, who seems friendly enough. But he insists there be no communication with the [[starship|ship]]. This is not acceptable to Kirk, especially since in addition to the death of one crewman, he has also lost contact with another, Rayburn, whom he left at the cave entrance. When Brown threatens Kirk with a [[laser pistol]], there is a brief struggle during which Brown is shot &ndash; and it is revealed that he is not [[Human]], but a complex [[android]]. Meanwhile, the massive android [[Ruk]] (the figure from the caves) immobilizes Kirk by picking him up and lifting him against a wall, preventing his escape.  ===Act Two=== In another room, Korby has Ruk, in a near-perfect imitation of Kirk's voice, send a message to the ''Enterprise'' through Kirk's [[communicator]], where [[Spock]] had been concerned that Kirk's routine check-in time had past. Korby warns Kirk that if he moves or cries out to Spock, Ruk will have no choice but to harm him. ""Kirk"" informs Spock that everything is fine and to maintain routine contact and signs off. Korby informs Kirk that Ruk had been tending the machinery in the ruins for longer than even he could remember. With his help and with the records Korby found, they built Brown. When directly asked by Kirk the fate of his second security officer Rayburn, Korby informs Kirk that Ruk killed both Rayburn and Matthews, but Korby claims it was expressly against his orders. Korby has Ruk imitate other voices, but grows angry when Ruk imitates Chapel. He orders Ruk never to mock or harm Chapel, and at Kirk's prompting, adds that he is to obey all of Chapel's commands. Kirk attempts to once again escape but Ruk is too fast for him. The hulking android picks him up and throws him across the room like a doll.   Korby returns to the main dining room to join Chapel and Andrea. Kirk is being held securely by Ruk as Korby begins to reveal more of his plans to Kirk and Chapel. Korby then reveals to them that Andrea, too, is an android and tries to convince a jealous Chapel that there is no romantic feelings between him and Andrea. Korby explains that Andrea simply obeys his orders, nothing more. To prove his point Korby orders Andrea to kiss Kirk, which she does, then to slap him across the face. But Kirk still demands answers: if these ""mechanical things"", as Kirk dubs the androids, say and do only as Korby programmed, then why did Brown tried to shoot him earlier and why did Ruk murder the two security officers? Kirk says that there are many things he still doesn't understand regarding everything that has been happening. Korby tells the captain that he will answer all of Kirk's questions now. A short time later, Korby leads Chapel to his laboratory where the [[android duplicator]], with a Human-shaped blank that Ruk just locked down, mid-torso, on the side facing her, catches her attention. Korby informs her that this is how an android is made, then orders Andrea to slightly turn the circular, turntable-like platform. Chapel is shocked to see on the other side Kirk, [[naked]], unconscious, and locked down by Ruk in a similar manner.  ===Act Three=== Kirk is then spun around on the platform to be copied, while a shocked Chapel looks on in confusion. Soon the physical process is completed. Korby says the android is an exact physical replica of the real Kirk. He then explains that he will transfer all of Kirk's memories into the android to make the duplication complete. But Kirk overhears this, and while Korby readies the machine, Kirk murmurs to himself, ""''Mind your own business, Mr. Spock, I'm sick of your half-breed interference, do you hear?''"" He repeats this as the memories are copied. Korby then presents his new android to Chapel. ""''How do you do, Miss Chapel?''""'   After the experiment, ""Kirk"" &ndash; in Starfleet uniform &ndash; joins Chapel for lunch, and asks her if she would obey if he gave her an order to betray Roger Korby. Chapel says, ""''Please don't ask me to make that choice.''"" The tone of the conversation causes her to lose her appetite, but she encourages ""Kirk"" to eat. With a smile, he informs her that ""''Androids don't eat, Miss Chapel.''"" She had been unknowingly talking to the android Kirk all along. Korby, Ruk, and the real Kirk, who is wearing a blue and green jumpsuit identical to Korby's, enter and even Kirk is impressed. He quizzes his duplicate on details of his life and family, but the android answers every question perfectly. The duplicate Kirk is sent to the ''Enterprise'' to secure the [[command packet]] from Kirk's [[quarters]] containing the ship's itinerary; Korby's plan is to select a [[colony]] where he can begin carefully manufacturing android replacements. He believes he can secretly create a superior android civilization, and he plans to prove it.   Kirk makes a third attempt to escape by choking Korby with a cord from the underside of the chair  and running off. As Ruk pursues him, Chapel yells after him, ""''I order you not to harm him!''"" Ruk imitates Chapel's voice in an attempt to lure Kirk out of hiding, but Kirk sees through the ruse and attacks Ruk with a broken-off [[stalactite]]. In the struggle, Kirk falls and hangs dangerously from the edge of another seemingly bottomless cavern.  ===Act Four=== But after Ruk stares at Kirk for a moment as he dangles off the precipice, the giant android pulls Kirk to safety, perhaps in obedience to Chapel's order not to harm the captain.  Meanwhile, on the ''Enterprise'', Spock is surprised by Kirk's unannounced return, as he casually strolls past him in a [[corridor]]. When Spock enters Kirk's quarters and tries to inquire about Dr. Korby, Kirk snaps at him, ""''Mind your own business, Mr. Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed interference, do you hear?''"" Immediately after this uncharacteristic outburst, Kirk is pleasant again; he returns to the planet, leaving a very bewildered Spock behind. Realizing that something is wrong, he forms a [[security team]] to prepare to beam down after ""Kirk"" has left the ship.  Back on the planet, the real Kirk asks Andrea to kiss him. He hopes to confuse and scramble her programming by showing her what kissing really is. She gives him the same type of kiss she gave him earlier: a brief, gentle kiss on the lips. After the brief kiss, she half raises her left arm ready to slap him &ndash; another repetition from the previous kiss. Kirk stops her from slapping him, grabs her, pulls her in close, and gives her a much longer, much more passionate French kiss. This confuses her, since she was not programmed to respond to him. Deep down, she enjoyed it, but her circuitry protested.  Andrea leaves and Kirk is then confronted by Ruk; Kirk discusses the {{dis|Old Ones|Exo III}} with Ruk. Kirk learns more about the ancient civilization: they built their machines too well, became fearful of them, and started shutting them off. But survival outweighed programming, and the androids murdered their creators. Goaded by Kirk, Ruk grows angry and realizes that Korby is doing exactly the same thing. He starts to threaten Korby, who is forced to destroy Ruk with a [[phaser]]. Meanwhile, Andrea comes across the android Kirk and tries to repeat the romantic advances, thinking he is the real Kirk. When the android Kirk refuses, citing it as ""illogical,"" Andrea vaporizes him with a [[phaser]].  In a scuffle between Kirk and Korby, a section of skin is torn from the back of Korby's left hand when he catches it in a sliding door &ndash; revealing wires and circuits. Chapel sees to her horror that Korby is {{dis|Roger Korby|android|an android}} as well.   Korby tries to explain to a shocked Chapel that while critically injured, he built a perfect body and decanted himself into it. He claims that he's ''still'' the real Roger Korby, but is unable to demonstrate any uniquely ""Human"" qualities.  The breakdown of this small segment of android civilization reveals the pitfalls of Korby's utopian vision. Soon enough, even he realizes this, and hands over his phaser in defeat and despair. But Andrea will not relinquish hers, and she confusedly tries to profess her love for Korby. As she kisses him, Korby pulls the trigger of the [[laser pistol]] in her hand, destroying them both.  Spock and his three-man security team arrive and come upon Kirk and Chapel. When Spock inquires about Korby's whereabouts, Kirk replies truthfully to his [[first officer]], ""''Dr. Korby&hellip; was never here.''""  Back on the ship, Chapel decides to stay on the ''Enterprise''. Spock then tells Kirk of his dismay over his use of the term ""half-breed"". Kirk replies, ""''I'll remember that, Mr. Spock&hellip; the next time I find myself in a similar situation.''""  The ''Enterprise'' leaves Exo III's orbit and travels on through space.  "

She walks over to the replicator and produces a birthday cake as it turns out to be Tuvok's birthday. Tuvok reluctantly blows out the candle on the cake, claiming it was a ""''fire hazard''"". [[Commander]] [[Chakotay]] calls Janeway to the [[bridge]]. The {{USS|Voyager}} has received a [[distress call]] from a [[Kes' starship|small ship]]. [[Sensor]]s reveal the ship has one [[Ocampa]]n [[lifeform]] on board. It is an aged [[Kes]], now around six or seven years old and appearing frail and weak, asking for permission to [[beam]] aboard. When [[Captain]] Janeway questions her motives, Kes cuts the com channel. Immediately after, her ship is on a collision course with ''Voyager'' and just before it is destroyed, Kes manages to transport herself on board.  ===Act One===  Furiously, she makes her way to [[engineering]], giving off high levels of [[neurogenic energy]] that destroy the sections she is walking through. She does not respond to any hails from the captain and even [[force field]]s cannot hold her back.    All attempts by [[Ayala]] and a security guard to stop her fail and she finally reaches [[engineering]], making her way to the [[warp core]]. While she is holding on to the core, she kills [[B'Elanna Torres]] with an energy pulse emitted from it. Holding on ever stronger to the warp core, she lights up and disappears. She somehow uses the warp core to [[time travel|travel back in time]] to [[2371]], 56 days and 17 hours after ''Voyager'' had become trapped in the [[Delta Quadrant]].    In 2371, there are now two Keses: the one that belongs to 2371 and the one that has traveled back in time to 2371. Materializing right next to the warp core, she transforms herself into a duplicate of the young Kes. The Torres of 2371 asks Kes if she would like to stay and observe a [[warp core assembly]], but she tells the chief engineer she is needed in [[sickbay]]. Upon arriving there, Kes starts fiddling around with some of [[The Doctor]]'s medical instruments. The Doctor is annoying her with his questions about what name to pick for himself. Barely listening to him, she picks up a [[hypospray]] and rushes out of sickbay.    In the [[airponics bay]], the real Kes who belongs to the timeline, is attacked from behind by the ""old"" Kes, sedated and hidden, so that there are not two Keses walking around the ship.   ===Act Two===  In the [[mess hall]], [[Tom Paris]] and [[Neelix]] are chatting about some unique names he could use for a [[cheeseburger]] he has made, when Kes walks in and asks Neelix for some [[coffee]] that she wants to bring for the captain. She is a bit grumpy and distanced, unable to laugh at Neelix's jokes as she used to. She grabs a canister with coffee and goes to the captain's ready room. Janeway and Chakotay are there discussing the [[Vidiian]]s, with the captain and [[first officer]] discussing the plight of the imperiled species and the lengths they go to to harvest organs. Chakotay wonders what [[Human]]s would do if they were faced with similar circumstances. Kes arrives shortly after and she spills some coffee on the captain's desk, supposedly by accident, and when the captain is called to the bridge, Kes accesses Janeway's computer terminal. When Kes leaves the ready room, Tuvok, who is standing on the bridge at the [[science station]] with Janeway and [[Ensign]] [[Samantha Wildman|Wildman]], looks at her from afar as if he sensed something.    Later, during a staff meeting in ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[briefing room]] which is all about finding a way to evade the Vidiians and navigate the ship through a region of space densely packed with [[subspace vacuole]]s, Tuvok suggests taking the ''{{dis|Delta Flyer|2375}}'' with its advanced sensors to navigate through the region. This comes as a big surprise to everyone, because they have never heard of a ''Delta Flyer''. Tuvok apologizes, believing that he must have been thinking of another [[starship]].    Paris finds Kes sitting in [[Class 2 shuttle 001|a shuttle]] programming a trajectory to {{dis|Ocampa|planet}} and asks her if she is [[homesick]]. She claims she's not. She's ""studying"" the helm configuration and asks Paris to teach her how to fly. He agrees to give her some tutorials in the [[holodeck]] in an old [[Class 1 shuttle]].    While entering a turbolift Tuvok sees [[Naomi Wildman]]. He follows the hallucination to Cargo Bay 2 where he sees the alcoves with all the rescued former Borg, [[Azan]], [[Rebi]], and [[Seven of Nine]], regenerating. Then he snaps back to reality when Lieutenant [[Joe Carey|Carey]], working at a console, asks him if he is all right.   Kes walks into her [[quarters]] to find that Neelix has prepared one of her favorite meals for her, leaving her a message that says how much he misses her. Suddenly, she becomes irrationally angry and furious, throwing everything off the table and yelling at the computer to turn off the music. She then asks it to open an encrypted channel and direct the signal to the Vidiians whom she informs about Captain Janeway's plan to evade their vessels. She offers to send them tactical data on [[shields]], weapons and anything else they need to take ''Voyager''. In return, she asks for safe passage back to Ocampa for herself and one other person. When asked by the Vidiian why she is abandoning her crew, she coldly states that they are not her crew, for they abandoned her long ago.  ===Act Three=== Kes is back in airponics checking up on her younger self whom she apparently has hidden in one of the drawers. After finding everything okay she heads over to a computer console to ascertain ''Voyager''{{'}}s tactical information where she bypasses the command authorization by using her powers.   at midnight.''""]] In the meantime, Tuvok discusses his hallucinations with the captain in her [[quarters]]. He informs her of having run into a half-[[Human]], half-[[Ktarian]] girl named Naomi Wildman in the [[turbolift]] and also of his encounter with a woman and several children with [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] implants. He cannot explain what is happening to him. Even though he has had hallucinations before, it has always been in the context of deep [[meditation]]. However, these are specific, evoking a sense of anticipation. He is concerned because [[Vulcan]]s generally do not have premonitions. Janeway instructs the computer to run a continuous scan around Tuvok so they can monitor what is happening to him next time he has another one of his visions.   Then Chakotay calls them to the bridge to inform them they have reached the subspace vacuoles. ''Voyager'' is programmed to fly at warp and make course corrections according to previously made scans of this region. This is going to take 3 hours 12 minutes and 11 seconds according to Tom Paris with 216 course changes. After the first course correction the captain leaves for sickbay to ask about Ensign [[Samantha Wildman|Wildman]]. Then Tuvok has another hallucination. This time it is a sensor reading of a vessel on a collision course, which no one else is seeing. Tuvok asks to be relieved of duty.  The Doctor, albeit reluctantly because of doctor-patient confidentiality, confirms Ensign Wildman's [[pregnancy]] which is producing a half-Ktarian [[female]] offspring, Janeway realizes that everything Tuvok said is true and that there is something very strange going on.   Tuvok's hallucinations become stronger and more frequent until he finally breaks down in engineering and goes into synaptic shock. Examining the proximity scan of Tuvok at the time where he broke down in engineering, Janeway discovers a surge in [[tachyon]] particles, indicating [[temporal distortion]]s and thus probably [[time travel]]. While nervous about these findings and researching the occurrence of tachyon particles elsewhere on the ship, ''Voyager'' suddenly finds itself under attack by the Vidiians.  ===Act Four===   The Vidiians keep matching ''Voyager''{{'}}s shield frequencies. Then the Vidiian ship attaches itself to ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[hull]], trying to access the ship directly. Janeway asks for the neural agent The Doctor has been developing and asks him to release it in the sections where the Vidiians have cut a hole through the hull, but much to their horror they find that [[environmental control]]s are not responding; they have been locked out of that system, all command relays have been fused and the Vidiians are about to board ''Voyager''. Janeway realizes that the Vidiians knew where to find them, along with their shield frequencies and which systems to target.    An [[electromagnetic]] fluctuation indicative of a transmission is detected in the airponics bay. Bioreadings pick up two Keses. Janeway makes her way down there, where Kes is about to unsuccessfully initiate a site-to-site transport. Janeway confronts her in the airponics bay. When asked why she is helping the Vidiians, Kes tells her that she is from a future she is hoping to change, and uses her telekinetic powers to throw Janeway around the bay and out of her way. She says that she won't let them hurt her again by taking her from Ocampa, her home. She claims to have been a prisoner on this ship, a child who was corrupted by their ideas of exploration and discovery. She tells her that in three years she will [[The Gift (episode)|leave]] ''Voyager'' in search of higher things because Janeway encouraged her to develop her mental abilities; something she was not ready for. She couldn't control what she found. It scared her, and she felt she had nowhere to go. She thought of returning home to Ocampa, but knew that the people on her home world would be frightened by her mental abilities and not accept her. But they will accept the younger Kes, the one she is holding and wanting to transport over to the Vidiian ship.    All attempts by Janeway to make her understand reason fail, and Kes becomes more and more furious until finally Janeway has no choice but to set her [[phaser]] to kill Kes. Meanwhile, Chakotay, utilitzing decisive and creative tactics, manages to break ''Voyager'' free of the Vidiian ship and drive them off.  ===Act Five===  Later, in engineering, Tuvok, who is standing in front of the warp core, says that Kes was standing exactly here during his last premonition, where she appeared older, her face tired. They note that tachyons are concentrated in the warp core and that it was possible that she used the core to travel back in time. If that is true, then she will need it again but unfortunately, they don't know when that will be and yet they have to be ready for it.   When young Kes regains consciousness, Captain Janeway tells her in confidence what has happened and that they will need her help to prevent it from happening again.    Five years later, ''Voyager'' receives a distress call from a small ship. Sensors reveal the ship has one Ocampan lifeform on board. It is an aged Kes, who appears frail and weak, asking for permission to beam aboard. When she hears that, Janeway, who admits she had almost forgotten the incident, is immediately alerted and knows what to do. She raises shields and goes to [[red alert]] and orders the emergency evacuation of deck eleven. Kes' ship is on a collision course with ''Voyager'' and just before it crashes, Kes beams herself on board. Furious, she makes her way to engineering, giving off high levels of neurogenic energy that destroy the sections of the [[corridor]] she is walking through. She does not respond to any [[hail]]s and even force fields cannot hold her back. On the bridge, Janeway orders the shutdown of the warp core and signals to Tuvok to be ready and follow her.    In engineering, Janeway plays the [[hologram]] Kes had recorded before leaving ''Voyager''. In that, the holographic recording of Kes reminds her older self that no one forced her to do anything; that she was the one who made the decision to leave Ocampa and also the one who made the decision to leave ''Voyager''. She asks her not to take revenge and just find another way home with the captain's help. She asks her to try and remember who she used to be. Janeway walks in, telling her what will happen if she crosses the timeline again. She offers her to stay with them on ''Voyager'' but Kes says that she cannot, for she does not belong there anymore and needs to be with her own people. Suddenly she smiles, saying that she now remembers the [[holo-recording]] she made years ago to remind herself of who she is. Janeway asks her whether it really matters which Kes goes home.   In the [[transporter room]], the captain and Neelix are sending Kes off. Neelix hands her a few snacks of [[leola root]] for the journey home and looks at her in reminiscence. When she asks him if he sees anyone he knows with a small smile, as she had changed a lot both inside and out, he replies that he only sees her. After Kes is beamed back to her vessel, Tuvok asks what they should tell the others. Janeway says to simply tell them that a friend got lost and they helped her find her way. With these words Janeway and Tuvok leave the transporter room and Kes' ship sets a course for home.  "
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0," == Summary == === Teaser ===  [[Odo]] arrives at [[Elim Garak]]'s [[Garak's Clothiers|shop]], as requested by the [[Cardassian]] [[tailor]]. He believes Garak wishes to report a [[crime]], but instead Garak attempts to introduce Odo to a [[Bajoran]] [[female|woman]] named [[Chalan Aroya]], the owner of the newly opened [[Celestial Cafe]] on the [[Promenade]]. Uncomfortable with women, Odo neither accepts nor declines her invitation for [[dinner]], noting that he doesn't eat. Garak expresses dissatisfaction in Odo's inability to act. Suddenly, Odo's shape destabilizes. As he vocalizes the pain, the destabilization continues. Eventually, he falls to the ground, unconscious. Garak contacts Dr. [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]] and requests an emergency [[medical team]].  === Act One === In the [[infirmary]], Bashir informs Odo that his [[mass]] and density are in a state of fluctuation, but is uncertain of the cause. The doctor insists that Odo remain in the infirmary, as movement may encourage the destabilization. Odo grudgingly agrees.  In the [[wardroom]], [[Benjamin Sisko]], [[Worf]], [[Jadzia Dax]], and [[Kira Nerys]] view a transmission from [[Klingon]] {{Chancellor}} [[Gowron]]. Gowron refuses to return captured [[Cardassian]] [[territories]]. He also demands that the [[United Federation of Planets]] withdraw from its [[starbase]]s and military installations in the [[Archanis sector]], despite its unimportance and previous relinquishment by the [[Klingon Empire]]. Dax states that several [[diplomacy|diplomats]] have informed her that several [[Federation colonies]] near the Klingon border are calling for a preemptive strike against the Klingons.  The [[senior staff]] is troubled by the growing prospect of [[war]], but realizes there is little they can do, Archanis is a long way from the station. Suddenly, Kira bursts into a fit of [[sneeze|sneezing]]. The sneezing is a result of her [[Body Parts (episode)|recent]] [[pregnancy]]. She is asked if Bashir can help, but states the doctor currently has his hands full with Odo's unknown illness. The [[crew]] agrees to leave Odo alone to rest, knowing that he values his [[private|privacy]].  In the infirmary, Kira visits Odo. Odo doesn't want company, but is happy to receive that day's [[criminal activity report]] from Kira. Noticing something on the [[PADD]], Odo leaves the infirmary for a [[docking port]]. He encounters a [[Boslic]] [[freighter]] [[Captain]] named [[Rionoj]], whom he suspects of attempting to steal the [[Falangian diamond]]. Unfortunately, as Odo prepares to arrest Rionoj, he is struck by the illness again, this time becoming completely [[liquid]].  === Act Two === Now back in the infirmary, Odo is in a near constant state of instability (primarily in the midsection) and admits to Bashir he is having difficulty maintaining [[humanoid]] shape. Bashir estimates that Odo will not be able to maintain solid form in one or two weeks. Bashir gives Odo the option of going to [[Bajor]] (to Doctor [[Mora Pol]]) or [[Starfleet Medical]], but Odo insists that only the [[Founder]]s can truly help his condition.  In his office, Sisko discusses the mission to take Odo to the Founders' new homeworld with the senior staff. They will enter the [[Gamma Quadrant]] uncloaked and transmit signals explaining their mission. Major Kira initially wants to go with them, but agrees to remain behind because of the pregnancy.  Now aboard the ''Defiant'', Sisko grants a request made by Garak to come aboard. Garak explains to Sisko that he wishes to ask the Founders about the crew members of several [[Keldon Omarion 001|Cardassian warships]] that went missing during the [[Battle of the Omarion Nebula|failed attack]] on the Founders. Sisko agrees to allow Garak on the mission so that Garak can distract Odo during the mission with a concoction of innuendo and half-truths regarding Garak's (alleged) past as a Cardassian [[spy]].  On the way to the ''Defiant'', Odo meets Quark, who predicts he will own the [[Deep Space 9|station]] by the time they get back (as well as a 60% increase in his smuggling profits due to Odo's absence); Odo warns Quark not to get too comfortable because he will be back. Odo then walks unaided across the [[Promenade]] as dozens of people watch his departure.  The ''Defiant'' leaves for the Gamma Quadrant. Garak occupies Odo's attention in the infirmary by telling him tales of his previous experiences, including his time as a [[gardener]] at the Cardassian embassy on [[Romulus]] during a period where several prominent Romulan officials died under suspicious circumstances. O'Brien tells the rest of the ''Defiant''{{'}}s bridge crew how he feels outnumbered now that Kira has moved in with [[Keiko O'Brien|Keiko]] and him and wishes Bashir would move in to even the numbers. The ''Defiant'' then meets and is surrounded by dozens of [[Jem'Hadar fighter]]s.  === Act Three === A request is made for someone from the [[Dominion]] to meet on the ''Defiant'' to discuss the request that was being transmitted. Before arrangements could be made, the [[Female Changeling]] and three Jem'Hadar soldiers beam directly to the ''Defiant''{{'}}s bridge. One of the Jem'Hadar soldiers attacks O'Brien by grabbing his chest until the Founder orders everyone to stop.   The Female Changeling, representing the Founders, says she has come for Odo and that he must go with her to the [[Great Link]]. As she is reluctant to reveal the location of the {{dis|Founders' homeworld|2372|Founders' new homeworld}}, but respects Sisko's loyalty to Odo when he refuses to leave the Gamma Quadrant without him, one of the Jem'Hadar named [[Amat'igan]] will pilot the ''Defiant'' while a device is installed that will keep the navigation system from recording their destination.  The Female Changeling visits Odo in the infirmary. They join and Odo is visibly much better and more stable than before. She then insists that they speak alone. During the discussion, it is apparent that the Founders have been keeping Odo under surveillance and knew he was not well. She admits that they made him ill so that he would be forced to return to the Great Link to be judged.  === Act Four === The Female Changeling tells Odo that he is to join in the Great Link, open his thoughts so that they can judge him for [[The Adversary (episode)|killing]] another Changeling, the first time the Great Link has ever had to render such a judgment on a Changeling. She also admits that only the Great Link can truly heal him of his illness.  In a [[corridor]], Garak and the Female Changeling discuss the possibility of Cardassian survivors from the earlier attack; she responds that the attackers, Garak, and all of Cardassia is dead for attacking the Founders and warns that retaliation is coming soon.  The crew discusses ways to maintain a transporter lock on Odo while he is in the Great Link, but, given his devotion to justice, he insists that the crew does not try to rescue him when he is being judged, despite O'Brien warning that the Dominion's idea of justice seems far different than Odo's.  Once at the Founder's homeworld, the Female Changeling, Odo, Sisko and Bashir transport down to a small rocky island that is completely surrounded by the Great Link. The Female Changeling walks into the ""ocean"" and, with a short glance and a smile back at Sisko and Bashir, Odo follows.  === Act Five === While waiting, Sisko stops Bashir from absentmindedly trying to skip a rock into the ""ocean"".   Worf catches Garak in a junction of a [[Jefferies tube]] in an attempt to control the ''Defiant''{{'}}s [[phaser]]s and [[quantum torpedo]]es. His plan is to commit [[genocide]] by destroying the {{dis|Founders' homeworld|2372}}; although the ''Defiant'' and its crew would not survive, Garak argues that it would be a small price to destroy the Dominion threat and save the Alpha Quadrant. Worf defeats Garak in hand-to-hand combat, commenting that he fights well… for a tailor.  Back on the planet surface, the ''Defiant'' crew sees Odo being ejected from the Great Link to the shore of the rocky island. He is not wearing any clothing. Bashir scans him and says he is getting strange readings &ndash; lungs, a heart, a digestive system… It's as if Odo were Human. The Female Changeling walks out of Great Link and says that Odo has been judged. She states that his punishment was to give him what he wanted: he has been made a solid. She then tells Sisko to take Odo and leave their home immediately.  Back aboard the ''Defiant'', Bashir takes a [[blood]] sample (type O negative) from Odo. The only thing unchanged is his face, which Odo realizes is meant to perpetually remind him of what he has lost now that he has become a solid.  The ''Defiant'' returns to Deep Space 9. Odo is in Garak's shop and purchases a uniform similar in appearance to the one he adopted while able to change form, albeit slightly itchy from the [[Inkarian wool]]. Odo realizes that some of the rest of his unease is due to being hungry, yet another sensation he did not possess while a changeling. As he is about to escort Garak to be confined for six months for attempted sabotage and assaulting Worf, Chalan Aroya enters Garak's shop and offers to help Odo in any way now that he is a solid; Odo still doesn't ask for a date but does respond with a broader smile than when he was first introduced to Aroya.  Odo leaves his office and meets Sisko in the Promenade; when Sisko suggests Odo is rushing his recovery, Odo insists that he must work: when he was in the Great Link, he finally understood the Founders, their hostility and distrust of solids, everything. But as soon as he experienced it, it was snatched away from him, leaving his job the only thing that he has left in his life. On the Promenade, a message from Gowron is displayed. Gowron states that a [[Klingon]] [[task force]] is to be sent to the Archanis sector in ten days and warns that any Federation stations or ships remaining in that sector will be destroyed. Sisko places the station on combat alert and asks Major Kira to alert the [[Bajoran Militia]].   Suddenly Odo realizes something: during his time in the Link, the Founders were trying to hide certain things from him. One of those things was Gowron. This can only mean that Chancellor Gowron is in fact a Changeling.  === Log entries === * [[Captain's log, Deep Space 9, 2372#Bringing Odo home|Captain's log, Deep Space 9, 2372]]  == Memorable quotes == ""''If Gowron is willing to go to war over the Archanis sector, then he has become even more dangerous than I thought.''"" : - '''Worf'''   ""''Two, three; I say she stops at seven.''""<br /> ""''I say eight.

The episode's first draft script, submitted on {{d|29|March|1996}}, was even written by him, though he eventually took credit for writing only the story, with the writing staff turning out the final script. (''Information from [[Larry Nemecek]]'') [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]] elaborated, ""''We saved [the story idea] for months and then incorporated it with the Gowron revelation.''"" The writers had first thought of Gowron being a Changeling when breaking the story for {{e|To the Death}}. Wolfe commented, ""''When we were talking about 'To the Death', we talked about twenty different missions the Jem'Hadar could go on with Starfleet. One of the missions we talked about is that they would have to go and kill Gowron because they find out he's a renegade shapeshifter. We played with that for a while and it didn't quite come together, so we went back to the original story. That idea &ndash; that Gowron was a shapeshifter &ndash; made a lot of sense to us, so we incorporated it into that ending to give the season ender a kick.''"" (''[[Captains' Logs Supplemental - The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages]], p. 121) * The logic behind setting [[Gowron]] up as a [[Changeling]] only to subsequently reveal that the real infiltrator is [[Martok (Changeling)|Martok]] was to enable the writers to end the [[Klingon]] war. By having the [[Federation]] ""save"" the Klingons from the Changeling, the cordial relationship between the two powers could be renewed, and the writers could get back to where they were heading with their original conclusion for [[DS9 Season 3|season 3]]. [[René Echevarria]] explained, ""''We wanted to close the chapter on the Klingon war, and get back to what the franchise had been, which was [[Cardassian]]s and [[Bajoran]]s''."" ({{ds9c|357}}) * [[Chalan Aroya]] was originally written to be a recurring character. The producers wanted to give [[Odo]] a love interest while he was a Human and Aroya was supposed to return in the [[DS9 Season 5|fifth season]] as that love interest. However, after watching this episode, the producers felt that she wasn't right for Odo, and so they abandoned the concept until the episode {{e|A Simple Investigation}}, where the character of [[Arissa]] was introduced as a one-show love interest. ({{ds9c|356}}) *[[Mary Kay Adams]] also auditioned for the role of Chalan Aroya. Adams commented: ""''""I really am a huge fan of [[Rene Auberjonois]], so I was excited about that. I had gone in for the producers to read for this Bajoran character, but in that session I saw a lot of the guys I had known from my first time on the show, and they were all wonderful and said, 'We were actually thinking about bringing [[Grilka]] back.' And sure enough, the next season they brought me back''"". [http://www.littlereview.com/getcritical/trektalk/adams.htm]  * The final draft script of this installment was issued on {{d|8|April|1996}}. {{Star Trek Minutiae|resources/scripts/498.txt}}  ===Production=== * This episode was filmed between [[11 April]] and {{d|19|April|1996}}. (''Information from [[Larry Nemecek]]'') * Odo's final pose on the rocky island is reminiscent of {{w|Michelangelo}}'s painting of Adam on the ceiling of the {{w|Sistine Chapel ceiling#Adam and Eve|Sistine Chapel}}. Of this scene, actor [[Rene Auberjonois]] said, ""''I was trying to convey Odo's amazement. All these emotions that are going through him, what it must be like suddenly to have a body and feel things inside him and outside him, and all the senses, like smelling and tasting, which he's never had before. I was a newborn adult. It was wonderfully challenging, trying to communicate all these feelings. It was exhilarating for him, yet at the same time he was terrified, filled with a great sense of loss. He's lost something of himself, but he's gotten something else.''"" ({{ds9c|355}}) * Of Odo's walk to the {{USS|Defiant|2370}}, Rene Auberjonois explained, ""''The last thing he wants to do is show weakness in front of the people he's sworn to protect. My image for the walk was {{w|Alec Guinness}} in {{wt|The Bridge on the River Kwai}}. That's what the scene was about to me. A person trying to hold himself together.''"" ({{ds9c|356}})  === Continuity === * The comment Garak makes about [[Chalan Aroya]]'s dress (""a thing of beauty is a joy forever"") is from Book 1 of {{wt|Endymion (poem)|Endymion}} by [[John Keats]], who is also mentioned in {{e|The Muse}}. * Returning for a third appearance, [[Leslie Bevis]]' character is finally named in the script (but still not onscreen) for this episode: [[Rionoj]]. Bevis previously appeared as the character in the [[DS9 Season 2|season two]] opener {{e|The Homecoming}} and in the [[DS9 Season 3|season three]] episode {{e|The Abandoned}}. * This episode is a sequel of sorts to the [[DS9 Season 3|third season]] finale, {{e|The Adversary}}, insofar as it is here that [[Odo]] receives his punishment for killing a fellow [[Changeling]] in that episode. He regains his shapeshifting ability in the [[DS9 Season 5|fifth season]] episode {{e|The Begotten}}. * This episode sees Odo officially disgraced and rejected by his people, making him the fourth regular character alienated from his race as punishment at present, the other three being Worf ({{e|The Way of the Warrior}}), Quark ({{e|Body Parts}}), and Garak (prior to the start of the series). * This is the first appearance of the [[Female Changeling]] since {{e|Heart of Stone}}. * Dialogue in this episode implies that it was the Great Link that caused Odo's ailment, not Section 31; the script for {{e|To the Death}} reveals that [[Weyoun 4|Weyoun]] infected Odo with the virus that afflicted him here when he clapped Odo on the shoulder after he rejected Weyoun's invitation to rejoin the Founders, making his illness here different from the virus created by Section 31. This was not how the scene was filmed, however, as that point in the conversation was filmed with a tight focus on just Weyoun's face, leaving Odo's point of transmission unclear, as his only other physical contact with a member of the Dominion was the Odo-initiated handshake the {{dis|Leyton|Changeling|Leyton Changeling}} in {{e|Homefront}}. * [[Cirroc Lofton]] ([[Jake Sisko]]) does not appear in this episode. This is the only season finale in which he does not appear.  ===Reception=== *[[Ira Steven Behr]] commented, ""''I think [the episode] is a strong ending to a strong season. On a certain level it's a character piece. We were a little worried about that, whether we should go bigger. {{e|The Way of the Warrior}} became such a burden, to an extent, because we did have such a big budget for that, and the audience expected us to go out with a bang. Well, we did, but it was a different bang and, as I said, we wanted to do something that brought the season full circle. I think we did that and I'm glad we did.''""

(Part 8 of 9)  == Summary == ===Teaser=== In [[Deep Space 9]]'s [[operations center]], the [[senior staff]] anxiously await the arrival of their new [[Federation]] vessel. [[Admiral]] [[William Ross|Ross]] presents [[Captain]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] with a new {{class|Defiant}} starship, the {{USS|Sao Paulo}}. On the surface, the ship looks identical to the {{USS|Defiant|2370}}, recently destroyed in the [[Second Battle of Chin'toka]]. However, this new vessel is equipped with cutting-edge [[Starfleet]] technology to counteract the [[Breen]] [[energy-dampening weapon]]. As the crew become acquainted with their new ""friend,"" Ross also leaves Sisko special orders from the [[Chief of Starfleet Operations]] to rename the vessel ''Defiant'', in honor of their recently lost ship.  Aboard [[Damar's attack ship]], [[Kira Nerys|Kira]], [[Elim Garak]] and [[Damar]] approach [[Cardassia Prime]]. Leaving the ship in [[Seskal]]'s hands, they beam down to the [[planet]] to meet with [[Gul]] [[Revok]] and [[Legate]] [[Goris]], both of whom have agreed to join Damar's rebellion. However, the trio arrive at the beam-down coordinates on a cave ledge, overlooking a massacre: [[Cardassian Rebellion|Cardassian resistance]] fighters are being shot dead by [[Jem'Hadar]] troops. Gul Revok has betrayed them. Kira hails the ship for immediate beam out, but in orbit, Seskal reports that they're under attack and has the shields up. He does his best to fight back, but the vessel is quickly destroyed by [[Breen interceptor|Breen]] [[Breen interceptor 003|interceptor]]. On losing contact with him, Kira realizes the three are stranded on Cardassia Prime; they carefully start making their getaway.  ===Act One=== With no other options, the three stealthily proceed to the Cardassian Capitol, to the house where Garak grew up. [[Mila]], [[Enabran Tain]]'s housekeeper, reveals Tain that was Garak's father but as head of the [[Obsidian Order]] could never publicly recognize Garak as his son. Mila agrees to provide them a safe haven in the [[basement]]; Kira and Garak politely ask her for a communication device and begin cleaning their new headquarters.  In the [[infirmary]] on [[Deep Space 9]], [[Doctor]] [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]] certifies [[Odo]] fit for duty. However, he feels the need to inform him that [[Section 31]] infected him with the [[morphogenic virus]] that is plaguing his people, the [[Changeling]]s, and that Odo had inadvertently transmitted the virus to ''them'', not the other way around. Odo expresses his disgust with the situation with which Bashir is in complete agreement. Odo then asks what the Federation intends to do about it.  In his [[quarters]], Sisko tells Odo that after considering the issue, the [[Federation Council]] decided not to give the [[Founder]]s the cure to their disease. Odo thinks that the Federation is simply abetting [[genocide]], but Sisko reminds Odo that while Section 31 might have been responsible for the virus, it was the Founders that started the [[Dominion War|war]], and that giving them the cure would only strengthen their hand, something unacceptable given that millions of men and women are currently risking their lives fighting the Dominion. Odo sees that the decision has been made and realizes there is no use in protesting it. As he begins to leave, Sisko asks Odo to promise him he won't take matters into his own hands. Odo gives the captain his word, but before he leaves notes that while the Federation is officially condemning Section 31's ethics and tactics, they are more than happy to turn a blind eye when they need the dirty work being done. Sisko doesn't like the facts very much but can't deny the truth of Odo's statement.   As [[Leeta]] and [[M'Pella]], another [[Dabo]] girl, decide to ask [[Quark]] for a pay raise, Quark retires into his bar's backroom to answer an incoming call from [[Grand Nagus]] [[Zek]] on [[Ferenginar]]. The Nagus, over a shaky, tenuous communications channel, informs Quark that he is retiring to [[Risa]] with [[Ishka]], Quark's mother. He then shocks Quark by apparently naming Quark his successor as the next Grand Nagus, in between static breakups of his transmission.  ===Act Two=== Bashir and [[Ezri Dax]], who have been tiptoeing on eggshells around one another, finally get a chance to speak openly; expressing a common attraction but agreeing to remain just friends.  As Quark revels in fantasies of wealthy extravagances, [[Brunt]] appears without his usual swagger at [[Quark's Bar, Grill, Gaming House and Holosuite Arcade|Quark's]]. Quark confirms the rumor of him being the successor to the Nagus. Brunt, keenly aware of their tumultuous past, kneels and begins repeatedly kissing Quark's hand while heaping praise upon his new Nagus. ""''Don't stop,''"" Quark gleefully tells Brunt.  Meanwhile, on Cardassia Prime, [[Weyoun 8|Weyoun]] broadcasts to all the population the news of [[Damar]]'s ""death,"" even as Damar listens to the message from the basement cellar. Weyoun's report that the Dominion has destroyed ''all 18'' Cardassian rebel bases from [[Atbar Prime]] to [[Regulak IV]] and [[Simperia]] to [[Quinor VII]]. It is a very bitter pill for the trio to swallow. With a smile, Weyoun states this is the first step to the Dominion's final victory. Also, the trio are unable to contact the Federation to be retrieved, as a signal strong enough to reach DS9 would be easily traced in a matter of seconds. The news devastates Damar; Kira, unwilling to spend the rest of the war in a cellar, tries to stir Damar and Garak to action, to no avail.  ===Act Three=== Brunt, who is graciously giving Quark a [[pedicure]], shocks Quark by informing him of recent social reforms on Ferenginar, including the introduction of prices of offical bribes; taxes to finance welfare programs such as universal health care and retirement pensions for the elderly. Quark vows to enact sweeping changes once he becomes Nagus, but is informed by Brunt that the position of Nagus is now on equal terms with 240  ""Congress of Economic Advisors,"" which must ratify any legislation ''proposed'' by the Nagus. Quark worries about the future challenges facing the next Nagus. (In comic relief both Quark and Brunt pray that Ferenginar turn back to unrestrained capitalism)  On Cardassia, Kira, Garak, and Damar lie on their cots in dejection and lament recent events to Mila when she brings them food. They consider themselves to have been stupid to have ever believed that they had a chance of toppling the Dominion and that everyone will be glad they're dead. Mila tells them that the citizens of the capital don't believe they're dead, and there are whispers going around of their survival. While Damar doesn't think this amounts to much, Kira realizes they still have a chance. The resistance might be gone, but they can create something far more powerful… a revolution! Kira and Garak attempt to stir Damar to action. It works: he asks how to start, and Kira asks for directions to the nearest Jem'Hadar barracks.   Weyoun introduces [[Legate]] [[Broca]], the new leader of the Cardassian people. He pledges his loyalty to the [[Founder]]s and the [[Breen]]. The [[Female Changeling]] announces that Starfleet has developed a new countermeasure against the Breen weapon, and thus a fresh strategy is required. She orders a fighting withdrawal, insisting to the Breen [[Thot]] [[Pran]] that it is ''not'' a surrender, just a chance to regroup and eventually redouble their shipbuilding and replenishment efforts.  ===Act Four=== Quark is back in his bar venting to [[Rom]] about Zek's new regulations that he will inherit. He's frustrated that these regulations are stifling the [[Ferengi]] entrepreneurial spirit. Rom listens but is only concerned with Quark's Bar. Quark can't get his mind off of it, and, as a consequence, spontaneously sells his bar to him for 5,000 bars of [[latinum]], without haggling over the price. When he suddenly realizes this, and also that he has been allowing his staff to keep their tips and was considering Leeta's request for a raise, Quark has to accept that he himself has been becoming softer and more lenient while eschewing traditional Ferengi practices. He compares this to the reforms which have ""come to ail"" Ferenginar, pledging a return to the old, traditional ways once he gains power. If Zek refuses to let him do so, he will in turn refuse the job, despite the wealth it will bring him. ""''The line has to be drawn here! This far and no further!,''"" Quark defiantly states to his brother.  Meanwhile, on Cardassia, Damar and Kira wait for Garak, who is planting an explosive device in a Jem'Hadar barracks, but he is detained by Jem'Hadar guards while attempting to leave. There's only seconds left before the explosive device detonates.  ===Act Five=== With a three-minute fuse delay, Damar and Kira come to Garak's rescue, killing one guard; Garak quickly slips a knife through the other Jem'Hadar guard's throat. The blast from the explosion draws a crowd, who quickly recognize Damar… the man the Dominion couldn't kill! He unites the throng with a speech, stirring them to join the rebellion against the Dominion, then retreats.  Bashir and Dax, still agreeing to remain friends, both board the [[turbolift]] for headed for Ops; but by the time they reach there, they are locked in a passionate embrace, obviously disregarding their ''friends-only'' stance. As heads turn throughout Ops to watch Dax and Bashir making out, Worf cuts the spectacle short by pressing a button at his console, sending the turbolift back down to the Habitat Ring.  When Grand Nagus Zek and Ishka arrive at Quark's, they are befuddled by Quark's statements; disregarding him, they turn to Rom, and announce ''him'' as the next Nagus. (Zek, in the garbled transmission a few days earlier, had mistakenly thought he was speaking to Rom, not Quark.) Rom is to be the next Nagus&ndash;and Ishka takes the credit for the idea, reminding Quark how he has always underestimated his brother. It seems her influence over Zek has spread to more than just social reform.  Quark is astounded at the sudden turn of events, even more so when Rom happily gives Quark the bar and the latinum he paid him for it back for free. Quark realizes that Rom is the perfect leader for the new Ferengi society, and that his bar will stay exactly the same. The drinks will continue to be watered down, the dabo tables will still be rigged, the staff will continue to be underpaid and overworked. Quark's will be the last outpost of the old Ferenginar. Nevertheless, Quark cannot help but be delighted for his brother.  While Quark returns to running the bar, the unassuming Rom begins his new tenure as Grand Nagus. His son [[Nog]] escorts the unabashed Brunt away from him, to stave off Brunt's corrupting influence. As his loving wife Leeta embraces him and wishes him good luck, Rom is left pondering his uncertain future as he tries out the [[Grand Nagus' staff]] for the first time, offering only a soft-spoken ""Wow"".  In DS9's [[wardroom]], Sisko, Ross, [[Romulan]] [[General]] [[Velal]], and [[Klingon]] [[Chancellor]] [[Martok]] discuss the Dominion's pullback and their new defensive perimeter. While Velal believes that containment will weaken the Dominion, Martok counters that the Dominion now has less territory to defend and retreating allows them to shorten supply lines, and the Alliance should attack before the Dominion has time to rest and re-arm. Velal argues, and Ross cannot disagree, that breaching the Dominion's new defensive line, even if done successfully, will come at a very high cost. But Sisko says that if they do nothing, the Dominion can sit happily behind their borders building vessels and cloning soldiers for the next few years, until they eventually launch a new offensive that would spell almost certain defeat for the Alliance. Ross reluctantly agrees, and, with Starfleet and the [[Klingon Empire]] both voting to attack, Velal comes around and finally agrees as well.  After the briefing, Sisko returns to his quarters to find his wife [[Kasidy Yates-Sisko|Kasidy]] still awake and sitting up on the couch. She is [[pregnant]], she announces. While happy, she is unsure of the future, given the [[Bajoran]] [[Prophet]]s' [[Penumbra (episode)|warning]] to Sisko, the [[Emissary of the Prophets]], to walk his path alone. Sisko holds his wife and assures her that as the Emissary, no harm will come to their child. The loving couple comforts one another and reflect that they're going to have a baby."

==Summary==
===Introduction===
''Z Minus 14 Days''

Commander [[Susan Ivanova]] records a personal log about recent events. Ever since Captain [[John Sheridan]] figured out that the [[Shadows]] could be disrupted by [[telepath]]s, he's been recruiting every one he could find and sending them off to various resistance camps and ships of the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]]. It's hoped their influence will reduce the Shadows' ability to wreak havoc. Sheridan himself has rarely left the [[War Room]]; he is tired, but he keeps pushing himself. Meanwhile, Dr. [[Stephen Franklin]], still on his Walkabout, has not been seen in over a week. Ivanova hopes he resolves his issues and returns to duty soon. She also notes that while she's not a Christian, she appreciates the presence of Brother [[Theo Ankises]]'s monastic order. They have provided a calming influence for the people on the station (''as she states this in voiceover, a monk relays a message to Brother Theo who reacts to the letter with some reluctance.''). Finally, she notes that Brother Theo's personality bears similarity to someone else she knows &ndash; [[G'Kar]].

G'Kar pleads to allow the telepaths to be given [[Narn]] bodyguards on a one-to-one basis. Ivanova explains that their security is already being guaranteed, but G'Kar counters that the Narns would be willing to go into danger with the telepaths so as to protect them from Shadow agents. He notes they serve themselves by doing so, a certain symmetry.

Meanwhile, [[Vir Cotto]] is preparing a meal in [[Londo Mollari]]'s quarters. As he does so, Mollari comes to the conclusion that he has to deal with G'Kar once and for all, and soon. Cotto is reluctant, noting there are more immediate concerns, but Mollari insists on dealing with G'Kar before ''he'' becomes an immediate concern. Cotto points out that G'Kar has sanctuary while he's on [[Babylon 5]], but Mollari knows this; his plan is to lure G'Kar back to [[Narn Homeworld]] where he can be caught and executed. And to his surprise, Cotto is informed he will be instrumental to the plan.

===Act I===
Ivanova waits in the arrivals area when Brother Theo joins her. He notes that the next few minutes will be notably aggravating for him. As he speaks, a boisterous voice calls out to him. Theo and the new arrival trade verbal barbs for a while before Ivanova asks for introductions. The new arrival is Reverend [[William Dexter]], a Southern Baptist. With him are Mr. [[Chong]], a Bhuddist monk, [[Rashid Abdul]], a Muslim cleric, and Jewish Rabbi [[Leo Mayers]]. As Ivanova shows them to temporary quarters, Theo continues to grumble but the others find it amusing. A few more notables arrive at the station: Lord [[Antono Refa|Refa]] and Minister [[Virini]], a high official of the [[Emperor of the Centauri Republic|Centauri Emperor]].

[[Delenn]] meets Sheridan in the War Room as he pores over his notes about the Shadow attacks. Even as Delenn tries to tell Sheridan that he's become rather hard to approach, Sheridan ignores it and remarks that while the Shadows are tactically brutally efficient, their gross strategy seems almost random, leading him to believe there is a greater logic behind them. Finally, Delenn insists that Sheridan take a rest, and he finally admits that, for the most part, he can't. Ever since [[Kosh]] was killed, his sleep has been troubled, full of nightmares. Delenn then informs him that some people he'd invited to the station have arrived and are waiting for him. Sheridan tries to say he doesn't have time, but Delenn points out she already made the arrangements, and since Minbari aren't supposed to lie (except to save face), her honor is at stake. Dinner will be in two hours.

Cotto returns to Mollari's quarters to inform him of the arrival of Refa and Virini, but Mollari already knows and is preparing to see them. Meanwhile, he tells Cotto how he will draw G'kar to Narn. G'Kar's attaché, [[Na'Toth]], has not been seen since the end of the [[Narn-Centauri War]] and is presumed dead, a casualty of the bombing. Cotto is to go to G'Kar and tell him that Centauri forces have located her and are holding her in one of the dungeon cells below the building once used by the [[Kha'Ri]]. The idea is that G'Kar, the only member of the Kha'Ri still free, would be among the few people who could navigate the maze-like caverns there. Since he and Na'Toth were quite close, he will somehow smuggle himself to Narn... where Mollari's guards will be waiting. Cotto does not want to go through with it, but Mollari insists. Cotto is the only Centauri G'Kar will have any reason to believe. When Cotto's conscience keeps him from agreeing, Mollari threatens to reveal his involvement in the Narn underground railroad which would humiliate &ndash; and ultimately destroy &ndash; his family and his House.

Refa sees Virini to his quarters. Both seem a bit demeaning of the accommodations and the Humans in general, but Virini gets right to the point: Refa and Mollari appear to be in the midst of a feud, and Emperor [[Cartagia]] wants the matter settled, giving Virini the authority to see to it. It will not be easy. Mollari has plenty of wealth and influence, but Refa has plenty of allies in the [[Centaurum]]. Indeed, Refa's purpose in inviting Virini to the station is to influence him over to his side. Mollari arrives just as Refa leaves.

Cotto arrives at G'Kar's quarters and relays the message as told to him by Mollari.

===Act II===
Virini tells Mollari the same thing he told Refa: the feud must be settled. Cotto joins them. Mollari then promises to prove House Mollari's loyalties by deeds rather than by words &ndash; starting with removing a certain ""embarrassment"" that has plagued the Royal Court for some time &ndash; before leaving with Vir.

Outside, Cotto is getting angry. He thinks Mollari sent him on his demeaning errand just so he could curry favor in the Royal Court. But Mollari points out that Cotto is too young to understand that this is how Centauri politics works.

Some time later, Sheridan and Delenn have dinner with their guests: Reverend Dexter and his companions along with Brother Theo. Sheridan reveals that the invitation wasn't merely social. With their ties to Earth severed and with [[ISN]] now a propaganda machine, it has been difficult to get the real news from back home. Dexter reveals that Brother Theo, despite their constant bickering, has been working on the problem. Dexter opens his Bible to reveal a cutout compartment. Inside are [[data crystal]]s. In them are various intercepts from all throughout [[Earth]]; each had gathered information from their various spheres of influence. The big news is that the Earth Resistance is still very much in operation, as much as President [[Morgan Clark|Clark]] would like the people to think otherwise. He's been trying to paint Babylon 5 as a renegade outpost working with aliens to subvert Earth.

G'Kar goes to Security Chief [[Michael Garibaldi]]. He needs to get to the Narn Homeworld in secret. Garibaldi points out that leaving means he can be pursued by the Centauri, but G'Kar insists, saying it's a personal matter. He just needs a craft able to drop him off just outside the capital and then pick him up again in a few hours. And he needs it immediately.

A despondent Cotto goes into a [[transport tube]]. Already in the tube is a Centauri guard. Upon seeing Cotto, he presses a button: apparently some kind of signal. When Cotto steps out again, several people grab him and drag him back into the transport tube. They take him into a darkened room and shut the door. A spotlight then reveals Lord Refa, who reveals that he intends Cotto to tell him Mollari's plan to depose Refa, or die.

===Act III===
After dinner, Reverend Dexter talks with Sheridan and has an idea. Before leaving, he hopes to hold an open church in the station's chapel, figuring the energetic style of a Southern Baptist sermon might be more to the station's liking. Brother Theo appears less than enthused at the idea but agrees to go along with it.

Cotto is sitting on a stool. Another empty stool is beside him. Refa sits down upon it and beseeches Cotto to tell him what Mollari has planned. Despite incentives and the death threats, Cotto steadfastly refuses to talk, so Refa decides to cut to the chase. Another Centauri appears in the light: a telepath. In spite of Cotto's resistance, the telepath scans Cotto and manages to learn of the plan to draw G'Kar to Narn. Satisfied, Refa leaves Cotto in the darkened room so that he cannot tell Mollari.

That night, Dexter is wandering, unable to sleep, and finds Sheridan sitting in his office. He walks in and offers some advice. He tells a story and uses it to note that, in his eagerness to work, Sheridan has been pushing away people close to him, and that could be unhealthy. Sheridan doesn't take kindly to the sermon at first but then realizes Dexter has a point: the same point Delenn had been trying to make earlier.

''Z Minus 13 Days''

G'Kar arrives on the Narn Homeworld where he confers with [[G'Dan]], a member of the local [[Narn Resistance]]. G'Dan tells G'Kar that the cosmic winter effect from the planetary bombardment (dust, constant wind, and colder days) will probably persist for several years at least. G'Dan also acknowledges the message G'Kar sent earlier, though he notes the task is very risky.

Elsewhere on the planet, Refa talks with [[Drigo]], another noble who is part of the local Centauri administration. They have been busy setting up an abandoned building to resemble the Centauri Royal Palace at the suggestion of Minister Virini, so that Cartagia would have a suitable place to stay should he visit. Refa then asks Drigo for a favor: a number of loyal guards to accompany him on a mission &ndash; to capture G'Kar. Once he has G'Kar, he'll be able to kill Mollari safely and present both to Cartagia in tribute.

===Act IV===
Taking Dexter's advice, Sheridan invites Delenn into the War Room. Together, they pore over the Shadow attacks. Like Sheridan, Delenn can't make sense of the pattern at first. But Sheridan appreciates the company at least. They decide to present the attacks in a three-dimensional grid again. This time, however, Sheridan notices something, and Delenn agrees. There's a gap in the attack pattern: a quiet zone where no attacks have taken place. A nagging suspicion dawns on Sheridan. What if the quiet zone is being used as a lure, to draw victims and refugees into one concentrated spot, so that they can just surround the spot and hit them all at once? Human history is full of these kinds of trap strategies: Dresden, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, San Diego. Such a move, done successfully, would be both devastating and demoralizing. 

Sheridan realizes that this could be the Shadows' strategy: to instill terror in everyone, not just by hitting them with devastating firepower but also by destroying any hope they may have of refuge. It is a known strategy, and one he could devise himself. Upon hearing that, Delenn stops him. This ""thinking like the enemy,"" while not unheard of in humans, scares Delenn. She drags Sheridan away from the War Room before he starts thinking too much like a Shadow.

Back on Narn, G'Kar leads G'Dan and some other Narns into the caverns under the Kha'Ri's old building.

Back on Babylon 5, someone rings the doorbell in the room where Cotto is being held. The telepath answers the door and is promptly knocked out with a punch. In walks Mollari, who complains about how hard the telepath's head had been. Cotto tells Mollari that Refa knows of the plan.

On Narn, G'Kar discovers Lord Refa and a number of Centauri guards waiting for him.

In the B5 chapel, Reverend Dexter leads a sermon about ""the enemy."" It is not the alien, not the non-believer. The real enemies are fear, ignorance, and those who say to hate that which is different, because that hate can be turned against the hater.

Refa orders G'Kar taken alive and the other Narns killed. But the guards don't move. When Refa asks why, G'Kar in response activates a holographic message from Mollari to Refa. In it, Mollari reveals the whole ploy had been an elaborate ruse meant to lure Refa away from the safety of Centauri Prime. The guards are loyal to Mollari and will not obey Refa. ''This'' was Mollari's plan to end the feud and to extract revenge for the inconvenience and deaths Refa's actions have caused, also providing a means to rein in the reckless [[Centauri Wars of Aggression]]. 

G'Kar is in on the plan as well, though for simpler reasons. Not only is this revenge for the [[Mass driver]] bombardments during the [[Fall of Narn]] and the Narn [[Genetic cleansing programs]] carried out under Refa's orders, but also, in exchange for his involvement, 2,000 imprisoned Narns are to be released. Mollari concludes by informing Refa that in the manner he will be killed, his House will cease to be a threat. Refa will be labeled a traitor and his political leverage will be destroyed. After the message ends the guards abandon Refa, and G'Kar reveals the final part of Mollari's plan. He places a [[Data crystal]] in Refa's clothes, ordering the others to leave it with Refa's corpse. He then orders Refa's head and face left intact for identification but says the rest is fair game.

As the congregation in the B5 chapel joins in singing ''No Hiding Place Down Here'', Refa tries to flee for his life, but even as the song describes, there is nowhere to hide. Narns soon capture Refa, drag him back, and start beating him mercilessly as G'Kar walks away.

===Act V===
Some time later, Mollari presents the data crystal to Minister Virini. It contains information that would have been of great value to the Narn Resistance. From appearances, it seemed Refa was trying to bribe the Narns into helping him: as the humans would say, ""play both sides against the middle."" Given the condition of his body, the answer was quite emphatically negative. Virini is a little surprised at this news, but Mollari points out that Refa had always been ruthlessly ambitious: out for no one but himself. The plan might have been to undermine the Royal Court so his sycophants could work their way into positions of power: taking Refa up with them. Given his questioning of Refa's authority, even Virini was a potential target. Regardless, Refa's death and apparent treason put a rather firm close to the matter of the feud. Despite some lingering doubt, Virini declares he will return to Centauri Prime and report to Emperor Cartagia, assuring Mollari he will be recommended for his service. Mollari expresses his gratitude.

Outside, Mollari finds Cotto angrier than ever. It is quite clear Mollari had been using and manipulating him in many ways.  Mollari patiently explained that he knew Refa had brought a telepath with him and had been expecting them to take Cotto hostage. His actions were meant to make sure they wouldn't suspect a trap, and it worked. Cotto points out they could have killed him, and when Mollari counters he was not important enough, Cotto counters he was important enough for Mollari to lie to him. Cotto finally vents his anger, saying that he thought he knew Mollari, but not anymore. Vir storms away, leaving Mollari to ponder this.

The ''[[White Star]]'' is in hyperspace, traveling to parts unknown. Sheridan keeps pushing Delenn to say where they're going, but she says it's a surprise. But she does point out that, now that they know what the Shadows are planning, for the first time they have the advantage. It is time to put all their forces into play. When they finally emerge back into normal space, Sheridan looks out and is awestruck. Delenn explains, ""''White Star'' was never intended to be one of a kind. It was only the first."" Before them stands the First White Star Fleet: finally complete and ready for action. The [[Rangers]] will take command of the ships, under their joint command. For the first time in the war, they have, as humans would say, ""a fighting chance."" Sheridan is completely at a loss for words, so Delenn offers something that does not require words: a long, passionate kiss.

''Z Minus 10 Days''

"
0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0," ==Plot== While attending a [[New New York Yankees]] [[blernsball]] game at [[Madison Cube Garden]], [[Fry]] is told by [[Leela]] that Blernsball is a ""jazzed up"" version of baseball. [[Bender]] is offended that humans won't let robots compete in the blernsball league. [[Hermes]] calls the crew to report back to the office for a delivery mission. The delivery is to [[Chapek 9]], a planet inhabited by human-hating robot separatists who kill humans on sight, so Bender is assigned the duty of performing the actual delivery. Bender claims that it is a robot-religious holiday, ''Robanukah'', and doesn't have to work. Despite his made-up holiday, Bender must go on the mission.  Upon arriving at the planet, a resentful Bender is lowered to the surface using the ship's winch. Fry and Leela decide to throw a [[Robanukah]] party for Bender to show their appreciation. They receive a rushed message from Bender, who has been captured by the robot separatists when they found out he worked for humans. In order to avoid being killed on sight, Fry and Leela disguise themselves as robots, and infiltrate the robot society.  After hiding out in a robot movie theater, Fry and Leela blend in with the crowd at the opening ceremonies of the daily human hunt. There they discover Bender is alive and playing the robots' prejudice for his own benefit, claiming he has killed a million billion humans on Earth.  Fry and Leela reunite with Bender during the hunt in an abandoned robot porn shop, but he refuses their offer of rescue. Before Fry and Leela can leave, the other robots arrive and they are placed on trial for being human. After being sentenced to a life of tedious robot-type labor by [[Computer Judge]], they are dropped through a trap door, where they meet the five [[Robot Elders]]. The Robot Elders reveal that the trial was for entertainment, and command Bender to kill Fry and Leela with a device called ''The Ceremonial Killamagig'', but he refuses. The Robot Elders reveal that humans are just being used as a scapegoat to distract the population from the actual problems; lug nut shortages and the incompetent corrupt government of Robot Elders, and that many of the supposed powers humans have that robots fear are in fact made up. The Robot Elders decide to kill the three, citing that they know too much. Fry threatens to breathe fire on the robot elders, throwing them into a state of confusion on whether humans can do that or if that was something that they themselves made up. The crew escapes, and is pursued by a horde of robots. As the crew escapes on the winch, the robots stack on top of each other to capture the crew. Bender remembers that he never actually delivered the package, and puts it into the hands of the robot on top. The unbalanced tower and the package falls to the ground, and the robots are showered in much-needed lug nuts, and renounce their human-hating ways. The crew, now en route back to Earth, celebrate ''Robanukah'' with Bender.  "

==Summary==
===Teaser===
The {{USS|Voyager}} comes into view from a distance. Suddenly, there is a sensation of the viewer being [[transporter|transported]] somewhere.

In a [[transporter room]] aboard ''Voyager'', {{Lieutenant}} [[B'Elanna Torres]] is next to an unidentified officer. She approaches and says that ""it"" is extraordinary. Lieutenant [[Tuvok]] joins her and reminds Torres that it also poses a potential security risk. [[Captain]] [[Kathryn Janeway|Janeway]] looks on curiously as Torres observes that it is losing power. Although Tuvok suggests that they let the power source run out and observe it while it is incapacitated, Torres insists that they may not be able to get it to work again and will have lost a valuable opportunity to study it. Erring on the side of exploration, Janeway agrees with Torres.

In [[main engineering]], Torres announces ""''The power's surging,''"" and uses some sort of [[tool]]. Meanwhile, [[Ensign]] [[Harry Kim]] waves a wand-like tool to the side. He asks her if an interface with an [[EPS]] [[power conduit]] would work. While she says the energy signatures are incompatible, Torres notes that the interface might buy them some time. Kim retrieves a cord, and they plug it in. Torres tells Kim to produce a two-second burst at 5% of maximum output but the energy transference is unsuccessful, and the screen begins to fade more often. ""''We're losing it,''"" observes Torres, ordering a burst with less power. As Kim and Torres perform the operations in question their subject, a metallic [[humanoid]], can only lie there.

===Act One===
As Torres and Kim continue to work on the mechanical man, she estimates that they will be able to keep it running for another eighteen hours despite the large amount of damage it has suffered. They attempt to establish what it is and determine that it is not a [[cyborg]] as it is completely [[robot|robotic]] and has no internal [[organ]]s. Because it has arms, legs, and a head, they establish that it was designed to perform motor functions, but Kim is unable to detect any pathways similar to those in an [[android]] by which information is transmitted. Torres discovers that it runs not on EPS flow but on a foreign type of superconducting [[tripolymer plasma]]. The robot emits a series of sporadic sounds and its head jerks back and forth, but they are unable to tell what, if anything, it is trying to say. While Torres is convinced that the robot is trying to speak and attempts to discern what ""Pra..."" means, Kim reminds her that they do not know for sure whether the robot is even aware of them. Waving his arms and hands in front of the robot's ""face,"" he receives no response. He notes that they have been working on it for hours and Torres tells him she could use some time alone to think. At this, he jokingly insists that he can stay up as long as she can. However, when the lieutenant threatens to pull rank on him and order him to leave, he concedes the point. However, he reminds Torres to tell him if she discovers anything new.

:""''[[Chief engineer's log, USS Voyager|Chief engineer's log]], supplemental. I've tried thirteen different methods of reinitializing the robot's power source, and I'm still having no luck, so I've decided to go to the mess hall to recharge my own declining energy reserves.''""

It is early morning and Torres sits in the deserted [[mess hall]], which is dark save for the light emanating from the adjacent [[kitchen]]. [[Neelix]] stands at a counter in the kitchen, cooking the crew's [[breakfast]]. Torres sips her [[coffee]] and requests another pot from Neelix, who cordially reminds her that breakfast is not served for another [[hour]] and a half; however, he offers her a glass of [[traggle nectar]] instead. He even offers to make his special [[Jibalian omelette]]. She stubbornly insists on coffee, but Neelix reminds her that two pots of [[Landras blend]] is the absolute limit. ""''You're cutting me off?''"" Torres asks incredulously. Neelix simply shrugs his shoulders as if to say, ""''I don't make the rules.''"" Joining Torres at the table, he asks about the status of their mechanized guest. She has only been able to postpone the inevitable thus far, and she compares the situation to a bleeding [[artery]] with no [[tourniquet]] available. The predicament reminds Neelix of a time when he was unable to find the right blend of [[spice]]s for his Jibalian omelette, and while Torres is patient, she does not appear enthusiastic about the prospect of hearing Neelix's story. He describes how he tried more [[Spith basil]], less ''[[prishic]]'', and so on until he eventually fell asleep. The answer came to him in a dream: He was using six spices, but the [[recipe]] called for seven. Sarcastically, Torres guesses the missing ingredient [[leola root]]. After giving her an equally sarcastic look, he tells her the spice was [[Nimian sea salt]] &ndash; the most common spice in the [[Milky Way Galaxy|galaxy]] &ndash; yet he had been too tired to realize it. Neelix's analogy is not lost on Torres, but she chooses to ignore his less-than-subtle hint and repeats her request for coffee. Neelix orders Torres to bed in a stern but affectionate tone, so she reluctantly agrees.

However, she does not return to her [[quarters]]. In main [[engineering]] once more, an exhausted Torres stands over the robot and knocks on its metallic head as if to ask if anyone is home. She pretends to hear the robot tell her to go to bed. ""''Well, I guess I'm outnumbered,''"" she sarcastically admits to herself, and she walks off. Once in her bedroom, Torres turns out the lights and gets in bed only to have a sudden inspiration much as Neelix did in his story. She immediately hurries to [[sickbay]].

As Torres activates the [[Emergency Medical Holographic program]], [[The Doctor]] appears and starts to make his usual statement: ""''Please state the nature ....''"" He looks Torres over; she did not take the time to change into her [[Starfleet uniform (late 2360s-early 2370s)|uniform]] and wears a pair of red pajamas. The Doctor dryly inquires if there has been a change in the official dress code, as no one informed him of such a change. Torres impatiently explains that her current attire is what she sleeps in. The [[hologram]] assumes that her haste is due to a medical emergency, but it is actually an engineering problem. After he pretends to think for a moment, The Doctor begins to say, ""''[[I'm a doctor, not a...|I'm a doctor, not...]]''"" but Torres cuts him off and finishes the statement with ""''...not an [[engineer]].''"" She explains that it is not a typical engineering problem, and as [[Kes]] has told The Doctor about the ""mechanical man,"" he is aware of the situation and does not require a full explanation. Due to a leak in the robot's power supply, Torres says he will ""die"" unless she can find a way to fix it. The problem is that the [[plasma]] from which the robot derives its energy is contaminated and it has begun to decay.

Using a medical analogy for the situation, The Doctor compares the contaminated plasma to diseased [[blood]] and suggests a [[transfusion]] from ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[warp plasma]]. The suggestion gives Torres reason to pause as she considers how different the two types of plasma are, and she reasons that the warp plasma is too highly charged for the robot's systems. In medical terms, the transfusion would be comparable to giving a [[Bolian]] a transfusion using [[Vulcan]] blood, which The Doctor notes would normally kill the unfortunate Bolian. However, he adds that in rare instances where artificial blood was unavailable, existing [[blood cell]]s has been genetically altered to make such transfusions possible. As Torres thinks, she slowly begins to formulate a plan using an [[anodyne relay]], but rather than explain the [[technobabble]] to The Doctor, she runs toward main engineering. ""''That's ''exactly'' what I was going to suggest,''"" he tells himself sarcastically.

Kim and Janeway join a now-[[Starfleet uniform|dressed]] Torres in engineering, where Janeway asserts that it is Torres' ""show"" and they will proceed when Torres is ready. Torres confidently activates the relays and instructs Kim to start the plasma transfer from the [[warp core]] to the robot, but as they proceed, they find that the energy levels are still too high. They manage to stabilize the flow and the plasma successfully begins to circulate through the robot's systems, but the three of them appear too nervous to say anything yet. Shortly thereafter, the robot's hand unexpectedly reaches up and grabs Torres' forearm. Although she is shocked and unsure of how to respond, the robot politely asks her to identify herself. When she does so, the robot states that it is [[Automated Personnel Unit|automated unit]] [[3947]] and thanks her for reactivating it.

===Act Two===

:""''Chief Engineer's log, supplemental. The robot's power module is continuing to function normally using plasma from our warp engines. Repairing its systems has taught me more about [[robotics]] than I ever could have learned at [[Starfleet Academy]].''""

Torres stands in front of a seated 3947 as she scans him with a [[Starfleet tricorder|tricorder]], optimistic that they are past the critical stage. 3947 concurs and reports that his self-diagnostic systems estimate he is running at 68% of optimal efficiency. Matching the Automated Personnel Unit's matter-of-fact voice, Torres calls him an extremely well-designed machine, to which he calls her an extremely proficient [[humanoid]]. Despite the fact that 3947 is a robot, it is obvious that Torres is growing fond of him. He reveals that he was operating an [[asteroid]] mining pod when it exploded, which is why ''Voyager'' found him adrift and so badly damaged, although he is unable to access information pertaining to why the pod exploded. He is able to tell her that he was stationed aboard a [[Pralor vessel]]. Torres hopes that they will be able to return 3947 to his people soon and assures him that the new plasma should bring him up to ""optimal."" When she mentions the new plasma, it seems to pique the robot's interest, and he asks if she is a ""[[Builder]]."" As an engineer, she supposes the word builder could apply to her, but the Builders were the humanoids who built 3947. He has sat idly until this point, but now he rises and faces Torres, suggesting that she could create a new [[chromodynamic power module]]. As 3947's power module is working fine, Torres sees no need for a new one; however, he intends the new module to be for a new automated unit like himself. Torres asks why the Builders cannot do so, but 3947 reveals that the Builders ""no longer exist."" Torres suddenly sees the issue in a new light.

In Janeway's [[captain's ready room|ready room]], Torres explains 3947's situation. The Builders constructed thousands of [[automated personnel unit]]s decades ago but were later killed off during a war. Now the units are wearing out, and while they have learned to make many repairs to themselves, they have been unsuccessful in creating new power modules. Torres believes she may be able to help 3947 do so, although she admits it will be an incredibly complex job. Janeway points out that Torres' suggestion is a clear violation of the [[Prime Directive]]. While Janeway admits that the robots are entitled to the same rights as organic life forms, she points out to Torres that they never had the ability to reproduce in the first place. Torres sees her suggestion as correcting a flaw, but Janeway argues that they don't know enough about the robots or the Builders, and there is no way to tell what the repercussions of their actions will be if they help 3947, and as such, it is not their place to play god. Despite Torres' repeated objections, Janeway forbids her to help 3947.

Back in engineering, Torres attempts to explain and defend Janeway's logic. 3947 notes that, while the Prime Directive prohibits interference in the evolution of other species, he and the other [[automated personnel unit]]s were built and therefore Torres should be free to help them build more. Torres insists that Captain Janeway does not agree with his interpretation, but 3947 observes Torres' visible disagreement. Unsure of what to think, Torres concedes that she wants to try to help the robots, turning away from 3947 as she speaks. In his calm, manner-of-fact voice, he states that the robots will not survive without Torres' help, which makes the decision even more difficult for her. ""''I thought Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres was a Builder,''"" the robot says. After a moment, she responds, ""''So did I.''"" Torres begins to walk away but stops to adds that ''Voyager'' has located 3947's ship and will be within communications range in an hour. The robot thanks her and she pauses before she leaves, the situation weighing heavily on her mind.

When the [[alien]] [[ship]] is within visual range, Janeway puts the ship on [[yellow alert]], has it slowed to one quarter [[impulse drive|impulse]] and tells [[Tom Paris]] to put the vessel on the [[viewscreen]]. It appears to consist of a central hub with four extensions in a star-like formation, and as the crew is entirely automated, there are no [[life sign]]s aboard. As the ship [[scan]]s ''Voyager'', Janeway opens a channel with it. A [[Pralor]] automated personnel unit [[6263]] appears on screen, identical to 3947, and requests that Janeway identify herself. She does so, informing him that ''Voyager'' would like to return 3947 to the Pralor ship. 6263 thanks her for the assistance. Paris jokingly comments on how polite the automated units are, to which Janeway smirks.

Torres and 3947 stand in [[transporter room]] 2 as she holds a canister out to him. She explains that it is filled with [[warp plasma]] in case the robot's plasma begins to degrade again. Thanking her, he takes the canister, but when she reminds him to adjust the anodyne relay periodically, he reminds her that she has told him already. The two shake hands, but 3947 does not let go of Torres' hand and shoots a burst of blue [[electricity]] through her body, rendering her unconscious. He catches her as she falls and fires a discharge across the room at the [[transporter technician]].

On the [[bridge]], Kim announces that he has detected a [[chromodynamic energy]] discharge in the transporter room. Janeway motions for a [[security]] officer to investigate as she attempts to contact Torres or the technician, but there is no response.

Waving his hand over the transporter controls, 3947 interfaces with the [[computer]]. Meanwhile, [[Chakotay]] announces that someone is initiating a transport of Torres and the robot. Kim attempts to block the transport, but it is too late as their signals are already in the [[transporter buffer]]. 3947 disappears from the transporter room with Torres in his arms.

===Act Three===
''Voyager'' immediately goes to [[red alert]] and attempts to [[beam]] Torres back aboard, but the vessel erects an unknown type of [[subspace]] defense field around it, preventing a beam out. When they do not respond to [[hail]]s, Janeway orders Kim to open a channel on [[wide-band subspace]]. She informs the ship that Torres' abduction is an act of aggression and threatens to respond in kind. There is a brief pause before Kim informs Janeway that the robots received the communication and simply chose not to respond. She confidently orders Tuvok to power the forward [[phaser bank]]s.

Meanwhile, Torres awakens in a sterile room on some kind of mechanical operating table, which adjusts from a horizontal to a vertical position as she becomes aware of her surroundings. Various robotic parts surround her and 3947 stands next to her. She demands to know what is happening, and in his ever-calm voice, the robot informs her that the room is where she will build a [[prototype]]. While she insists that he return her to ''Voyager'', 3947 claims it is not possible and informs Torres that her [[communicator]] has been deactivated. She instinctively heads toward the nearest exit, but 3947 grabs her by the arms and restrains her. Struggling, Torres does not understand why he is behaving this way. 3947 repeats the necessity for additional automated units but reassures Torres that he does not wish to harm her; when she reminds him of Janeway's orders, he calls it ""inadvisable"" for Janeway to provoke the units.

While Torres and 3947 talk, Kim informs Janeway that there has been no indication of a response from the Pralor ship and Tuvok adds that he is unable to penetrate the defense field. Janeway asks Chakotay if there is any indication that the ship intends to attack, but due to the [[deflector shield]]ing, he is unable to say what the [[weapon]]s capabilities are, let alone whether the robots plan to use them. Still optimistic that they may be able to avoid a direct confrontation, she tells Tuvok to open a hole in the ship's shields wide enough for a transporter signal but without hitting the ship and instructs Kim to match the targeting coordinates of the transporter with those of the phaser fire. Once the phasers are aligned, ''Voyager'' fires on the ship, reducing its shield capacity to 80%. Janeway tells Tuvok to continue, but it responds with a type of [[quantum resonance charge]] similar in appearance to [[disruptor]] fire. Tom Paris initiates [[evasive maneuvers]], but the charges quickly reduce ''Voyager''{{'}}s aft shields to just over half strength. Although Kim reroutes spare power to the shields, they are soon at less than a quarter as Paris attempts to throw the attacker off by switching evasive patterns. Janeway orders Tuvok to load the [[photon torpedo]] bays.

As the battle rages on, Torres is able to see ''Voyager'' from the Pralor viewscreen, and it is evident that her crewmates are fighting a losing battle. 3947 stands next to her and observes that ''Voyager''{{'}}s shields are failing, and its weapons pose no threat to the automated personnel units.

Smoke comes from one of the consoles on the wall as Tuvok announces that the Pralor have penetrated ''Voyager''{{'}}s aft shields, and Chakotay points out that the ship must retreat. Janeway agrees, but Paris announces that ''Voyager''{{'}}s propulsion systems are off-line and the ship is currently dead in the water. A [[hull breach]] soon occurs, although an emergency [[containment field]] seals it temporarily. The [[environmental control]] systems begin to fail and deck eight loses [[artificial gravity]], while injury reports come in from all decks and Janeway looks at the viewscreen, determined but helpless.

An equally helpless Torres urges 3947 to stop the attack on ''Voyager'', which poses no threat to the robots. 3947 reminds her that they are programmed to defend themselves, and although ''Voyager'' may be helpless for the moment, their enemies must be destroyed. Turning to 3947, Torres insists that she and her crewmates are not his enemies; he agrees that Torres is not but observes that Janeway and the crew who follow Janeway's orders are. She reminds him that Janeway favored reactivating 3947 over the objections of the [[Chief of Security]], but he simply looks at the viewscreen; both of them know what the robot wants. With no alternatives, Torres gives in and offers to help build the prototype.

Chakotay announces that the life support system is failing, but suddenly, ''Voyager'' stops shaking as the Pralor ship ceases firing. Tuvok informs the crew that the enemy has powered down its weapons systems and there is an incoming hail. Janeway rises and approaches the viewscreen, as Torres appears to ask if everyone is okay. Reassuring her they will be fine, Janeway asks what has happened. When she hears that Torres plans to build a prototype, Janeway begins to remind the lieutenant of her orders, but Torres reassures the captain she does not like it either. As Torres talks, she looks off-screen nervously and helplessly asks what other choice she has; as if to emphasize the point, 3947 adjusts the camera to focus on his cold, metallic face.

===Act Four===
Aboard the Pralor [[starship]], miscellaneous mechanical components such as arms and [[skull]]s can be seen as 3947 explains that Torres will have all the materials necessary to complete a prototype unit. He will remain to supervise her and allow her access to [[database]]s and [[schematic]]s, but she will not have access to critical systems or be allowed to contact ''Voyager'' or leave the room. With that, he tells her to proceed. Torres inquires about the robots' previous attempts to create a new [[chromodynamic power module|power module]] and finds that, although they duplicated an existing module exactly, its power supply was insufficient to power a new unit. 3947 even shows her a schematic from each of the power modules, which are identical in every way. As he does so, 6263 enters the room.

The unit asks 3947 what he has to report, but Torres sarcastically observes that she has been working for less than five minutes and has little progress to report. Ignoring Torres' comment, 6263 tells 3947 that ''Voyager'' will require about 140 hours for repairs and that they must finish the prototype by then. Torres wonders why he is concerned when the Pralor ship is clearly a match for ''Voyager'', but 6263 claims that statistical probabilities indicate a high likelihood that the crew will make a rescue attempt and ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[Warp drive|engines]] are superior to those of the Pralor at optimal efficiency. 3947 further adds that humanoids' cognitive thought processes are ""unpredictable"", and they do not necessarily make decisions based on tactical probabilities. When 6263 suggests that Torres might intentionally delay progress on the prototype, she takes offense and indignantly informs him that she follows through on her word and will do her best. In her defense, 3947 adds that she is operating at ""optimal efficiency."" However, while she promises to do her best, Torres tells 6263 that there are no guarantees. He states that if she fails, she will die, and with that he exits. Once he is gone, 3947 tries to comfort Torres by explaining that 6263 is a designated command unit who is only following his programming. She reiterates that she will do her best and reminds him that she does not need to be threatened; 3947 believes her but adds that 6263 doesn't know her the way he does. Hearing this once again stirs up Torres' ambivalence about the project as she realizes how much she wants to help 3947, and she asks to see one of the power modules.

Janeway meets with Kim, Tuvok, and Chakotay to discuss the status of the ship and Chakotay enters the data from the other officers' reports into a [[PADD]] as they speak. Kim reports that the hull has been sealed but there is no power on decks three through seven, while Tuvok reports that [[aft]] shields are completely nonfunctional, and Kim adds that the [[dilithium matrix]] is destabilized, rendering [[warp speed]] impossible. Chakotay estimates at least six days of repairs based on this feedback, but Janeway finds this unacceptable and demands a plan to get Torres off the Pralor ship before she is able to finish a prototype. In order to facilitate such a plan, Tuvok suggests that they make the warp drive their top priority, as any escape attempt will require a quick getaway. Kim asks how 72 hours sounds for repairing the dilithium matrix, but Janeway thinks it is 24 hours too long. Rather than spend more time reviewing the data, she dismisses them to work on their respective areas.

Torres works diligently on the would-be Automated Personnel Unit, adjusting part of a power module while 3947 acts as her assistant, handing her various tools such as a [[sub-micron scanner]] and a [[phase coil resonator]] as she requests them. After a few seconds, she tells him that she thinks she knows why the previous prototypes failed but does not know what to do about it yet. Rather than explain the problem outright, she begins with the fact that the units' parts are interchangeable, so if 3947 loses an arm, it can be replaced easily. Since the parts are identical, the existing units have been able to produce new parts because they are able to duplicate what they see; however, each power module's energy signature is slightly different, so even an exact copy of an existing power module will not work on a new unit because each unit has a unique signature. However, she does not think that she can make the signatures interchangeable. 3947 concludes that Torres has failed and informs her that he will tell 6263. ""''Do all you automated units give up the minute you hit a bump in the road?''"" Torres asks. She thinks the matter over for a second and tells him they need to make a standardized module with a uniform energy code to power any unit, at which point 3947 concludes there is ""reason for greater optimism."" Smiling, Torres replies, ""''You took the words right out of my mouth.''""

Meanwhile, Tuvok, Kim, Chakotay, Janeway, and Paris are gathered around the [[Vulcan]]'s [[tactical console|post]] on ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[bridge]], where he displays a computer diagram to demonstrate that between ''Voyager''{{'}}s power shortage and the complexity of the Pralor defense field, they are unable to beam Torres from the other ship. However, Chaotay and Kim note that they would be able to transport Torres out if they were able to get inside the field. Paris believes that a [[shuttlecraft]] would be able to do so, but as ''Voyager'' was virtually rendered defenseless by the Pralor weapons, such a plan would require a diversion in Tuvok's opinion. Chakotay suggests another attack, but Janeway does not want to risk another direct confrontation. While Paris is confident enough in his piloting skills that he would not need a diversion, Chakotay sarcastically notes that he does not want to lose another shuttlecraft.  Paris sarcastically thanks Chakotay for the ""''heartwarming''"" concern over his well-being. Janeway announces that the warp engines will be back online in twelve hours. By that time, she wants a diversion ready for the Pralor ship.

Torres work on the prototype unit, as she is receiving feedback from the motor circuits on what is to be the prototype's arm. She lightly asks 3947 if he will be the ship's new [[obstetrician]], but he seems confused and asks her to rephrase the question. Putting it more directly, she asks if he will be in charge of assembling the new unit. Such thoughts seem beyond his scope as he informs her that he was made to be a maintenance unit and neither he nor any of the other units on the ship have any knowledge of design. In that case, she informs him that he has just volunteered for new duty. She tells him to be sure to watch closely, which he does, although he seems somewhat frustrated as he explains that he lacks her improvisational skills. However, Torres reassures 3947 that once she has finished, he will only need to replicate what he sees. There is a pause while 3947 observes Torres' work closely, and as she begins to speak, she asks if she can call him 39. The concept of a nickname seems lost on the robot; he bluntly states that he is <tt>Automated Personnel Unit Three-Nine-Four-Seven</tt>. She remembers that she is speaking to a robot and goes along with it, asking 3947 how long he has been ""alive"" and whether he woke up on a bench similar to the one on which the prototype currently rests. He has been in service 1,314,807 hours and 33 minutes ([[2222|150 years]]), he reports, which gives Torres reason to pause. The two seem to reach more common ground as he tells her that he was activated by a Builder from the Pralor [[homeworld]] and Torres asks if the Builders were like her and her crewmates. 

Unfortunately, he is not familiar enough with her [[United Federation of Planets|culture]] to make a comparison and asks for additional information. 3947 asks if her culture includes [[artificial lifeform]]s, which Torres acknowledges it does, describing the various shapes and sizes and noting that most lack 3947's cognitive abilities. He wonders if they are servants, causing Torres to consider the matter for a moment. Hesitantly, she acknowledges that one could call them servants, but she clarifies that most are not sentient as he is. When Torres describes [[Data]], the only sentient [[Soong-type android|artificial lifeform]] where she comes from, 3947 expresses interest in becoming acquainted with Data, especially intrigued by the fact that he has equal status to a Builder. As he talks, Torres observes that the power module is functioning well, and 3947 assures her she will succeed. ""''Don't send me [[flower]]s just yet,''"" she warns him in a friendly manner, since they do not know if it will power an actual unit. 3947 confidently states that he believes it will and Torres smiles.

Chakotay enters Janeway's ready room to report that the dilithium matrix will be stable and they will be able to reinitialize the warp core in six hours. As for the diversion, Chakotay describes a time when Torres used a [[holoemitter]] and a [[deflector array]] to create the illusion of another starship out in space. Janeway likes the idea, but before the two can discuss the matter further, Tuvok announces over the comm that [[sensor|long-range sensors]] have detected an unidentified alien ship heading toward them. She and Chakotay head for the bridge.

Finally installing the power module in the prototype unit, Torres announces that it fits properly and optimistically tells 3947 to cross his fingers. He literally does so, although he must use the opposite hand to position his fingers. When she turns the power module, the unit begins to sit up but shuts down after a few seconds, at which point 3947 states the obvious fact that it does not function correctly. Torres remarks that the Builders should have programmed him with more patience and adjusts the power module more. The prototype suddenly seems to come alive as it sits up and looks around as if disoriented. ""''Prototype unit [[0001]] is ready to accept programming,''"" it states. Torres looks at it with disbelief and realizes that they have done it, although 3947 corrects her: ''She'' has done it. 3947 reaffirms his faith in Torres' abilities as the prototype repeats its request for input. Torres shakes 3947's hand and congratulates him on becoming a father. However, the celebratory atmosphere is interrupted when the ship shakes violently.

From the viewscreen, Janeway and the crew watch a tan-colored vessel nearly identical to the Pralor ship swoop in as it and the Pralor ship exchange fire. Kim reports that there are no signs of life aboard the second ship, just as with the first, and Tuvok adds that nearly identical automated units are operating the second ship as well. Janeway is baffled as she realizes that they may have stumbled into the midst of a robotic war.

===Act Five===
While the Pralor and [[Cravic ship]]s exchange fire, Chakotay tells Janeway that they need to retrieve Torres immediately. Although Janeway agrees, she first orders Paris to back ''Voyager'' away slowly from the two vessels in order to demonstrate their neutrality. As Paris does so, the second vessel hails ''Voyager'' and [[Cravic]] Automated [[Commander]] [[122]], a tan version of 3947 and 6263, requests they identify themselves. When Janeway does so, the Cravic unit orders her to withdraw from the area, but she informs him of Torres' presence aboard the Pralor ship and refuses to leave without her. The Cravic unit instructs Janeway to stand by and warns her that she will be fired upon if she attempts to intervene in the conflict. Once the transmission ends, the crew realizes they have been given a diversion and Janeway asks Kim for the status of the warp drive. Although it is an hour away from being fully repaired, Janeway sends him to engineering with orders to prepare to produce as much warp power as possible, as it is unlikely, they will have an hour. She then tells Paris to head for the [[shuttlebay]] and Chakotay takes Paris' place at the conn.

While the battle rages on around them, 3947 explains to Torres that the attackers are [[Automated Personnel Unit]]s from the Cravic homeworld. The other units were programmed by ''their'' Builders to attack the Pralor units. Torres begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together in her mind as the prototype unit interrupts them to state once again that it is ready to accept programming. Torres realizes that the Pralor and Cravic were enemies, and as the Pralor are extinct, she suggests that Captain Janeway might be able to contact the Cravic in order to stop the fighting. However, 3947 reveals that the Cravic are also extinct.

Paris pilots a [[Type 8 shuttlecraft 006|shuttlecraft]] between the two robotic ships as they continue to slug it out, keeping a subspace channel open with ''Voyager'' and informing them that he is near the perimeter of the Pralor defense field. Tuvok instructs Paris to rotate the shuttlecraft's [[shield harmonic]]s, which should allow it to pass through the shield. A few seconds later, the shuttlecraft is deflected roughly, as it attempts to pass through the barrier. Tuvok obviously has a backup plan in mind as he gives Paris a set of coordinates and instructs him to head there; however, Tom points out in a confused tone that the coordinates are in a direct line of fire between the two ships. As Tuvok speaks, Janeway looks at him pensively. He explains that the Cravic fire has opened a hole in the Pralor shields, which Paris might be able to get through &ndash; if he can dodge the disruptor blasts.

Torres does not understand what 3947 has told her. The robot explains that all automated units were programmed to achieve victory. The prototype unit once again requests input, and as it speaks, 3947 seems to be receiving information of some sort. He informs Torres that the Cravic ship has breached their defense shield; however, she is more concerned with why the Pralor and Cravic never called a truce. The robot informs her that they did so and later attempted to stop the automated personnel units from fighting; as a result of which, the robots terminated their Builders.

Meanwhile, Paris approaches the rift in the field and Tuvok guides him toward it.

3947 explains with terrifyingly accurate logic that that the automated personnel units were designed to destroy the enemy, and when the Builders no longer had need for the units and attempted to terminate them, the Builders ''became'' the enemy. Now he is confident that the Pralor units will be victorious, as they have the ability to produce a new supply of automated units. The ship continues to shake as he speaks, and a fire erupts in another part of the room; he calmly uses a communications device to order a fire unit to the [[reconstruction bay]] where he and Torres are located. Suddenly, Torres realizes that the individual energy codes were ''intended'' to prevent the robots from creating new units to stop them from overpowering their creators. She frantically looks around and grabs a knife-like tool as she looks at the prototype unit. The prototype innocently looks up at her and states its request for programming, but she stabs it, causing it to short circuit. 3947 immediately fires a burst of electricity at Torres, knocking her to the ground. He pauses for a second as he approaches; doing a robotic version of a double take, he realizes what Torres has done, and informs Torres that she will make another unit. When she refuses, he reminds her that he thought she was not an enemy. ""''I never wanted to be,''"" Torres says before Paris' transporter beam picks her up and beams her out.

Torres materializes aboard the shuttlecraft unconscious from the effects of the shock she received from 3947. Paris contacts ''Voyager'' to inform Janeway that he has rescued Torres, who will have to be beamed aboard once he clears the defense field. Tuvok confirms that the automated ships continue to fight one another, taking an interest in neither ''Voyager'' nor the shuttle.  Janeway informs Kim that they will leave as soon as Paris returns.

Janeway and Torres sit in the [[mess hall]] as ''Voyager'' travels at [[warp speed]] and Kes pours them each a cup of [[coffee]], ""compliments of the [[chef]]."" Torres is relieved as she claims that Neelix's coffee has never tasted so good, sentiments Kes assures her she will pass on to him. Once Kes is gone, Torres tries to apologize for going against the captain's orders and nearly breaching the Prime Directive, but Janeway understands that Torres did what she had to do for the safety of the crew. Janeway adds that it must have been difficult for Torres to destroy something she created, knowing from Torres' report what a significant achievement the prototype unit was. Torres describes how amazing it was for the prototype to look up at her and ask her for programming. ""''It must have been difficult,''"" Janeway repeats quietly. ""''It was necessary,''"" Torres replies.

== Overview ==
[[Kryten]] is reset to factory settings, while [[Dave Lister]] and [[Kristine Kochanski]] face two years in [[The Tank|the brig]]. The newly-revived [[Arnold Rimmer]] ponders whether to help them or exploit them.

== Summary ==
[[Dave Lister]] ([[Craig Charles]]), [[Kryten]] ([[Robert Llewellyn]]), [[Kristine Kochanski]] ([[Chloë Annett]]) and [[Cat]] ([[Danny John-Jules]]) make it, or rather, they think they have made it, to a [[shuttle bays]] and sneak aboard a ''[[Blue Midget]]'', however the attractive [[Ground Controllers|Ground Controller]] tells Cat he needs clearance. In order to prove that he is capable of handling the ship, as well as impressing the woman, he begins an impromptu dance routine with ''Blue Midget'' as his partner. Amazingly, this ploy works and the flight controller agrees to a date with Cat who is more than ready to stay behind and get ready before Lister forces them to leave.

[[Arnold Rimmer]] ([[Chris Barrie]]) reaches the [[Artificial Reality]] suite and blackmails the officer on duty using information from the [[confidential crew files]] into leaving. In the simulation, the crew begin their search for the [[nanobot]]s to prove their testimony. Lister then begins to discuss the deal he made with Rimmer, however Rimmer begins to edit out all mention of his name and the agreement. The crew in the simulation notice the jumps in their actions and conversation and realise that the whole escape attempt is a simulation designed to test their responses, having been knocked out when they licked the envelopes at the earlier hearing. Lister realises that they have actually proved their innocence, as they have indeed been trying to track down the nanobots who resurrected the crew. Rimmer, desperate to protect himself, then begins more edits to make Lister and the others seem guilty. Deciding they need to get out of the simulation, the crew search for the emergency exit which is hidden by a cryptic clue. Amazingly, Cat is the one to work out that the button marked 'E-Eleven-T' is the trap door (as eleven is XI in [[:wikipedia:Roman numerals|Roman numerals]]). Pressing the button, the four then find themselves as plasticine characters trapped in the simulation's [[:wikipedia:Screen saver|screen saver]]. Cat once again finds the emergency exit, and the four leave again.

The crew wake in the AR suite to find Rimmer trying furiously to place them back inside, however he is quickly on the run as the sexual magnetism virus causes Kochanski to lust after him. Hobbling to the lift, Rimmer is protected from her advances by the others while Lister tells him that taking the luck virus will cure the sexual magnetism virus. Thanks to this, Rimmer, his leg and an embarrassed Kochanski are returned to normal. The crew are now forced to take Rimmer with them as they make a real escape attempt.

The five make it to ''Blue Midget'' and once again a flight controller demands clearance... and this one is far from attractive. Cat decides to forego the dance and ''Blue Midget'' leaves the ship in a hurry, breaking its way out. While making plans to pick up supplies from ''[[SS Einstein]]'', talk turns to the [[wikipedia:Theory of relativity|theory of relativity]]. Naturally [[Holly]] ([[Norman Lovett]]) is [[Computer senility|unable to recall]] what it actually means, but takes offence at being labelled an idiot and reveals that he created the nanobots that resurrected the crew in order to fulfil his directive to keep Lister sane. Everyone is shocked that Holly nearly got them thrown in the brig, but Holly tells them they still might end up there... everyone is still in Artificial Reality and so is Rimmer.

From his office, Captain [[Frank Hollister]] ([[Mac McDonald]]) discusses the events with the original version of Holly who still has an IQ of 6,000. It turns out that Hollister suspected Rimmer of being in league with Lister and the others when he came to his office with so much knowledge and had him lick one of the psychotropic envelopes when he invited him to the captain's table. Lister and the others are found not guilty of the charges against them based on their actions in the AR Suite... but now have a new charge brought against them; using [[confidential crew files|confidential crew information]] for their own gain. Of this, everyone is found guilty and are sentenced to two years in the brig. The five are released from AR and realise they still have the [[positive virus]]es, since they have not really been used, only for Hollister to confiscate the luck virus to send for testing. As they are photographed in their prison uniforms, Holly realises that he's buggered up again.

Below, the crew are welcomed by Warden [[Ackerman]] ([[Graham McTavish]]) to '[[The Tank]]'. While this is going on Lister, still in possession of the sexual magnetism virus, empties the tube over Rimmer as revenge for his actions earlier. Rimmer then realises that he's becoming very popular with certain rough segments of the male inmates.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"== Summary == === Teaser === :""''[[Counselor]] [[Deanna Troi]], [[personal log]], [[stardate]] 44805.3. My mother is on board.''""  The fear is real for [[Jean-Luc Picard]] as he ''slowly'' exits the [[turbolift]]&hellip;  The captain is on his way to a [[transporter room]], to receive ""the leading [[scientist]] of [[Kaelon II]]"", an extremely reclusive people, who have not yet had real contact with the [[United Federation of Planets]]. On his way there, Picard encounters [[Lwaxana Troi]] in the [[corridor]], who effusively greets him, a little bit to Picard's chagrin. He tries to get rid of her, but she cuts off every one of his attempts at escape. He also tries to explain to her that her presence when receiving the guest would not be welcome, but she interrupts him again, and Picard eventually gives in, allowing her to join Picard, [[Miles O'Brien]], and [[Geordi La Forge]] in the transporter room.  There she immediately focuses her attention on the puzzled guest, [[Dr.]] [[Timicin]], whom she leads away intending to show him the ship, explaining ""''you just think of me as your entertainment director.''"" Once Lwaxana, Picard and Dr. Timicin have left the room, La Forge jokes to O'Brien: ""''That man's in a lot of trouble.''""  === Act One === :""''[[Captain]]'s log, stardate 44805.7. For generations, the people of Kaelon II have been working to revitalize their dying [[Kaelon sun|sun]]. The Federation has offered to assist in testing what may be a solution to this problem.''""  Deanna Troi, [[William T. Riker|William Riker]], Dr. Timicin, Picard, [[Data]], [[Beverly Crusher]], and La Forge are seated in the [[observation lounge]]. Dr. Timicin has made modifications to some of the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s [[photon torpedo]]es, which should help to revive the dying sun of the planet. The ''Enterprise'' is on its way to an empty star system with a sun almost perfectly identical to the Kaelon sun, in order to test the modified photon torpedoes. Timicin tells the assembled officers he has spent 40 years of his life trying to find a way to save his people's sun. He says he is grateful for their assistance and that his only wish is to revive their sun before he dies.  Meanwhile, on the [[bridge]], Lwaxana bothers an unnerved [[Worf]] by calling him ""Woof"" and playing around with the [[tactical station]], almost pressing a [[torpedo]] launch initiator. As Riker, Deanna Troi, and Dr. Timicin return to the bridge, Lwaxana vividly greets the doctor, who explains that he does not have time for her right now, as he is expected in [[engineering]]. Riker politely asks her to clear the bridge, and she agrees reluctantly. Dr. Timicin then explains to Deanna that he is surprised that Lwaxana is old enough to be her mother: ""''She is so&hellip; vibrant.''"".   In [[engineering]], Data, La Forge and a slightly overworked Dr. Timicin prepare the test with the modified [[photon torpedo]]es. Lwaxana then walks in with her assistant Mr. [[Homn]], claiming that the men really need a break and sweeps all of their [[PADD]]s off the [[master systems display table]] and onto the floor. Dr. Timicin agrees: ""''Mrs. Troi, you're a wise woman. I'm sure we could use a respite.''"" Mr. Homn then throws a cloth on the engineering table to start.  Later that night, Timicin and Lwaxana have spent some time together and they are heading for Lwaxana's [[quarters]]. He mentions while in the [[turbolift]] with Lwaxana that his [[wife]] had died a long time ago and that he has been dedicated to revitalizing their sun because they cherish their home planet. When they arrive at her quarters, she invites him in for a [[night cap]], however, despite the fun he is having, his says he must decline. When the [[door]] closes, his face turns to an understood regret and he leaves.  === Act Two === Lwaxana is having a hard time picking an outfit. She is excited about meeting Timicin, which pleases Deanna but she also brushes off her mother's comments about her own personal life.   The sun-reviving experiment is launched into the empty [[Praxillus system]]. Worf confirms via [[long range sensor scan]] that the system is clear of ships and lifeforms while La Forge and Timicin run diagnostics. With everything ready, Picard orders Worf to deploy the torpedoes. The ''Enterprise'' monitors the results which initially appear successful as the system's star heats up according to plan. However, the heating process fails to stop. Picard immediately orders [[Ensign]] {{dis|Bennett|Ensign}} to take the ''Enterprise'' to warp two just as the star explodes. Timicin sadly concludes the experiment in failure, but thanks Picard through [[tear duct|tears]] for his help. Disappointed himself, Picard orders the ship back to Kaelon II.  Timicin is especially crushed by the failure of his experiment, and the reasons for this become evident as Lwaxana bonds further with the scientist. He sits alone at a table in [[Ten Forward]] and Lwaxana joins him. She tries to cheer him up, but he cannot participate. He asks her to stay, and wishes they had met years ago, since he is going to his planet to die.  === Act Three === Timicin reveals that he's approaching the age of 60 and thus he is to undergo the ""Resolution"", ritual [[suicide]], Lwaxana becomes livid with protest.   In [[captain's ready room|ready room]], Picard, Riker, and Data are being informed by [[Science Minister]] [[B'Tardat]] that, even though the ''Enterprise'' is willing to stay to assist in a second attempt, Timicin has ""obligations at home"" and won't be able to continue. Puzzled, they offer to stay longer and make arrangements, but the Minister doesn't elaborate, rather thanking them again and ending the transmission. Lwaxana enters and explains the situation, distraught. She demands Picard intervene to spare Timicin's life, but Picard refuses to do so, as he is bound by the [[Prime Directive]] not to interfere with Kaelon culture. Furious, Lwaxana tells Picard she is not bound by it and storms out of the ready room. Picard taps his [[combadge]] and asks the computer for the location of Counselor Troi.  After an incident in a transporter room, where O'Brien refuses to beam her down to Kaelon II, Deanna enters and she and a very upset Lwaxana discuss Timicin's impending ritual suicide. Deanna calmly explains O'Brien has his orders and, when she starts to cry, O'Brien leaves to check the [[pattern buffer]]s to give them privacy, locking out the [[transporter console]] before departing. Deanna tries to comfort her mother, noting it's all right that she's crying, like the time [[Ian Andrew Troi|her father]] died. Lwaxana doesn't think it's the same, but isn't sure. She knows for sure she can't accept that fate would bring Timicin into her life only to be taken away for ""no good reason."" Deanna can only say that she will never be one of those people that ""die before they die"" and they embrace on the transporter pad.   Later, Lwaxana goes to Timicin, admitting she is hateful about the custom, hateful of him for going through with it and will never accept it. They embrace and [[kiss]] passionately.  === Act Four === Lwaxana and Timicin spend a lot of time together, discussing the concept of his species custom of ritual suicide back and forth. Timicin attempts to explain that in his culture it is an accepted practice for all to undergo the ritual on their 60th birthday in the presence of their beloved ones to avoid old age, infirmity, indignity, dependence on others, and the cruel uncertainty about when the end would come. Both end up finding each other's point of view cruel: Lwaxana because she sees it as arbitrary murder in an uncertain universe when death can come both well before and well after the designated age, Timicin because she is denying people control of their fate and the opportunity to end life with dignity.  Initially, Timicin is reluctant to break with tradition, and intends to return to his planet and go through with his ritual suicide, until realizing that he has some ideas about the failure of his experiment, and if he only had some more time, he could perhaps come up with a functional sun-reviving system. However, because his birthday and ritual are rapidly approaching, he will not have the time to develop the system if he follows tradition. Thus, he ends up seeking [[asylum]] from Captain Picard.  === Act Five === A diplomatic incident is created by Timicin's seeking asylum, and warships from his planet are dispatched by Minister B'Tardat and have been sent to retrieve him. Complications further arise when it's learned that because of his defiance against the ritual, the Kaelon government has barred his submitting of any other transmissions about the project; even if he does find a solution to the problem with their sun, Timicin's people will not listen due to his rebellion, rendering it moot. This results in a standoff, and after some time, Timicin's daughter {{dis|Dara|Kaelon}} boards the ''Enterprise'' to attempt to convince her father to return to the planet.  Timicin finds his daughter's arguments very convincing, and ultimately decides to return to his planet and carry out the tradition, thus concluding the diplomatic incident. As Timicin steps on the transporter pad, Lwaxana comes in to accompany Timicin to the planet and participate in his Resolution. She promises Picard not to cause trouble on the planet. Picard gives her permission to go, and Timicin and Lwaxana beam down hand in hand to the planet.  "
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"==Summary== ===Teaser=== Chakotay enters the [[cargo bay]] where he finds [[Naomi Wildman]] and [[Icheb]] working on an educational [[jigsaw puzzle]]. Chakotay is in a bit of a hurry, looking for his stash of [[Antarian cider]]. He wants to bring a bottle to his weekly dinner with Captain Janeway. He is in a good mood and quite amused with Icheb's frustration with Naomi's playful attitude while she is supposed to be studying. He tells Icheb not to tell [[Neelix]] of his hiding place, as he only has a couple of bottles left. Icheb suggests to hide the cider among [[Borg]] spare parts, where Neelix is sure not to snoop.  While Chakotay and Captain Janeway enjoy a quiet dinner in the captain's [[quarters]] &ndash; or rather attempt to, since her [[replicator]] decides to burn her [[pot roast]] &ndash; ''Voyager'' encounters a [[temporal anomaly]]. Chakotay quickly runs down to [[engineering]] while the captain gets to the bridge.  In engineering, Chakotay tries to prevent a [[warp core breach]], but a surge of temporal energy travels through the core, and hits him. He is quickly transported to [[sickbay]] showing signs of [[progeria]] on his face and in various organs of his body.  ===Act One=== The Doctor treats Chakotay, telling him that his body parts were out of temporal sync with each other; some organs were as if they belonged to a child while others were as if Chakotay were an old man. However, using a chroniton-based serum the Doctor has succeeded in bringing Chakotay's body back into alignment. Chakotay decides to head straight to the bridge, and tells the Doctor to come with him in case any other crew are injured. The Doctor 'reminds' Chakotay that he's unable to leave sickbay. Chakotay, confused, asks what happened to the [[mobile emitter]], but the Doctor has no idea what that is. Chakotay, in a hurry, leaves alone.  Once in the [[turbolift]], a strange wave of light sweeps from above as the lift rises to the bridge, and the [[medkit]] that he was carrying vanishes. When Chakotay arrives on the bridge, he causes a stir and Janeway acts as if she doesn't know him. The captain's long hair is tied up in bun, much like when ''Voyager'' arrived in the [[Delta Quadrant]]. Janeway informs him that ''Voyager'' is pursuing the Maquis ship in the [[Badlands]], and that Chakotay is her primary target. She orders him taken to the [[brig]], but the officers with him vanish as they go down in the turbolift, and he arrives in engineering [[2372|5 years ago]] during the [[Kazon]] takeover of ''Voyager'' by [[Seska]]. Chakotay manages to escape through another distortion. Seska asks the rest of the Kazon in Engineering to scan for anomalies.  ===Act Two=== Chakotay manages to get back to sickbay, where he realizes that The Doctor's treatment allows him to pass through the [[Temporal barrier|temporal barriers]]. He asks the Doctor what [[stardate]] it is; the Doctor says it is stardate 49624. The Doctor won't get his mobile emitter for [[Future's End, Part II (episode)|another year]].   With this in mind, Chakotay takes a [[hypospray]] with the serum in it and heads back to the bridge, where he confronts the past Janeway once more. Chakotay tells her that an anomaly has hit the ship in the future causing him to shift into the past. Janeway tells him that her [[helmsman]] ([[Lieutenant]] [[Stadi]] at the time) walked out of her ready room into the corridor and disappeared. However, the occurrence doesn't sway Janeway into believing Chakotay, so he claims the hypospray holds [[poison]] and presses it against Janeway's neck, threatening to kill her. Chakotay, still holding the captain, heads off in the direction that the crew member had gone before they disappeared. The two shift into another timeline, Chakotay having injected Janeway with the hypospray seconds earlier.  Chakotay explains to Janeway that it is all true and that they are good friends in the future. Still skeptical, Janeway offers her help in formulating a plan, but they must get to sickbay. On the way to sickbay, they pass into another timeframe, one where two wounded crew members are laying on the ground unconscious. Chakotay theorizes that it may be either [[Waking Moments (episode)|when the crew was under the influence]] of the [[Dream Alien]]s, or [[Bliss (episode)|when the crew encountered]] the [[telepathic pitcher plant]]. He assures Janeway that the crew will be fine.   Chakotay suggests they go to [[astrometrics]] to scan the ship for temporal fractures, surprising Janeway who doesn't think ''Voyager'' has such a lab. They enter astrometrics to find Icheb and Naomi Wildman as adult Starfleet crewmembers, surprised to see them since, in their timeline, the captain and her first officer had died seventeen years earlier.  ===Act Three=== Icheb and Naomi reveal that the ship has been fractured into thirty-seven different timeframes. The focal point of the surge appears to have been obliterated. Naomi wishes that [[Seven of Nine]] was there to help them but tells Chakotay and Janeway that they don't know when or where she is. Before Chakotay leaves, Icheb tells him that he never told Neelix where Chakotay hid his bottles.  They find her in Cargo Bay 2, still a pure [[Borg drone]], with the other Borg drones that beamed aboard [[Scorpion, Part II (episode)|during]] their alliance. She informs them that the Borg vessels experience chronological stress when they travel through their tunnels, and that they keep the Borg vessels in temporal sync by projecting a chroniton field and suggests that if they modify the [[bio-neural gel pack]]s that run ''Voyager''{{'}}s systems, it will return ''Voyager'' to Chakotay's timeframe.  The Doctor modifies a pair of bandoleers to resist the temporal barriers to hold the hyposprays. The Doctor starts talking about the Delta Quadrant, but Chakotay cuts him off, not wishing to violate the [[Temporal Prime Directive]] any more than Chakotay already had. Chakotay and Janeway head off to inject the necessary packs, first passing through time into past events, although Chakotay does not realize this at first. They inject the gel pack, and narrowly escape when a [[macrovirus]] from [[Macrocosm (episode)|that timeframe's infestation]] turns up. It chases them through a time barrier and disappears.  They find themselves having enter the [[holodeck]] into [[Tom Paris]]' favorite holoprogram, ''[[Captain Proton]]'', where they are met by the various cheesy characters that they must get past to inject the gelpack in holodeck number two, mainly achieved by Janeway's reluctant impersonation of [[Queen Arachnia]].  ===Act Four=== Janeway is strapped to a table while [[Chaotica]] is preparing to torture her. Then Janeway and Chakotay tell Chaotica that there is a danger from the 8th dimension. Chaotica is then manipulated into exposing and injecting the gelpack and they manage to convince him to release them to rid the rest of Chaotica's realm of those gelpacks.  In the [[transporter room]], they encounter several members of the Maquis, including [[B'Elanna Torres]] and [[Ayala]]. They are hostile to Janeway and Chakotay, but allow them to inject the gelpack and leave. Janeway questions Torres' comments about stranding them in the Delta Quadrant and Chakotay assures her that she did it for a good reason.  When they enter the [[mess hall]], they find it being used as a sickbay and injured crewmen litter the floor, being treated by Tom Paris for [[radiation poisoning]] due to the temporal anomaly in Chakotay's timeline. Neelix gives Janeway some [[coffee]] and assures her that he has faith that they will come through this crisis like they have all others &ndash; surprising Janeway as she has obviously never met Neelix before &ndash; while Chakotay injects the gelpack. Janeway then finds a badly-injured [[Tuvok]], who greets her before dying. In a turbolift Janeway hatches an alternative plan: to bring the entire ''Voyager'' into her timeframe. She intends to prevent Voyager from being stranded in the Delta Quadrant in the first place; having heard about encounters with the Borg, dreaming aliens, macroviruses, telepathic pitcher plants and the like, she believes that they'll hit one disaster after another and she's better off ignoring the Temporal Prime Directive if it means avoiding these. Chakotay tells her that she's only seen the bad side of their journey, and there's plenty of good things ahead as well; she'll help out many species, allow Seven of Nine to regain her Humanity, reform Tom Paris into an outstanding officer and husband to Torres, provide a home for Naomi and Icheb, and combine a group of Starfleet officers and Maquis rebels into a crew who will make just as much of an impact on the Delta Quadrant as it does on them, led by a captain who doesn't doubt for one minute they'll make it home. Janeway, swayed by his argument, agrees to help return ''Voyager'' to Chakotay's timestream.   Later, Chakotay fills Janeway in on Seska and the two agree that she and the Kazon won't cooperate. Janeway however has a backup plan.   Chakotay goes to engineering and explains everything to Seska, who agrees with his solution&hellip; at least, part of it. She realizes that if Chakotay is there from the future, and his timeline's version of ''Voyager'' is free, then they must have re-taken the ship from the Kazon and makes an attempt to bring the ship into sync with her timeframe instead so she can stop this.  ===Act Five===  acts as a ""[[lightning rod]]""]]Meanwhile, Janeway, Paris, and Kim watch from the higher section of engineering. Paris and [[Harry Kim]] leap onto two of the Kazon, while Naomi and Icheb correct the modification that Seska had already made. [[Ayala]] and [[B'Elanna Torres]] disarm another Kazon guard, but Seska holds Janeway hostage. She disarms Janeway and holds a weapon to her head, forcing all of them to drop their weapons. Seska is about to kill Janeway when Seven of Nine enters engineering, repelling Seska's shots with a Borg [[force field]]. She slaps Seska and chokes her, forcing her to release Janeway. This means that Chakotay can initiate the pulse, thus erasing the memories of the other participants while Chakotay has Torres help her avert the events that caused the anomaly by diverting all of Voyager's power to its deflector system and setting it to a specific frequency, thus using the deflector array as a lightning rod for the energy surge, burning it out, but no other damages occur.  Back in the present, Chakotay reminds Janeway that they have not finished their dinner. Janeway is surprised but follows Chakotay off the bridge. Back in her quarters, Janeway asks Chakotay about the experience. He declines to answer, gently reminding her of the [[Temporal Prime Directive]]. When they run out of cider, Janeway surprises Chakotay by suggesting he should go to the cargo bay to get another bottle. When Chakotay asks her how she found about it, Janeway also declines to answer, reminding him of the Temporal Prime Directive.  "

==Plot==
Sean Moore is a successful businessman who one day begins to see objects he had in the past. Realizing that he has a second chance, he decides to trade his money for one girl's affection.

Moore is preparing to sell his coffee company to a multi-national conglomerate. His secretary, Kate, passes on his messages and reminds him that it is his mother's birthday. Moore tells Kate to send flowers and Kate tells him that he has an interview with reporter Elizabeth Carter. He agrees to meet her in his office and she asks him why he is selling the company. Moore is happy to admit that he is in it for the money. Carter then switches to more personal questions, asking about his father's signed baseball that he sold for $8,000 to start his career. Irritated, Moore starts to get a headache and ends the interview. Afterward he opens his desk drawer for aspirin and finds the baseball. He wonders if Carter planted it, but Kate insists that the reporter was never out of her sight.

That night, Kate calls to tell him that no one in the office knows about the baseball. Carter calls to set up a follow-up interview and Moore lets the answering machine take it. He then gets a call from another woman, Alicia, asking to come over. They make love and afterward Alicia emphatically says that she loves him and couldn't live without him. Once she has finished, he tells her to leave and pays her. Sean reminds her not to go so heavily on the ""I love you"". As she dresses, Moore finds his old high school jacket in his closet, the jacket he burned years ago. He thinks Alicia is responsible but she denies having ever seeing it and leaves. He finds a letter in the pocket from his first girlfriend, Bess Wicker. It talks about how she could not forgive him and she is not going to California with him.

When Moore goes back to his office and parks in the sub-basement, Carter comes out of the shadows. She accuses him of being afraid to look at his past, and that now he does not care about anyone and no one cares about him. She steps into the light and says she loves him, and he realizes that it's Bess. Kate comes out of the elevator and when Sean turns back to Bess, she has vanished.

Moore calls the magazine and asks them about Bess. The editor tells him that they did not schedule an interview and that Bess died three days ago in a car accident. He wonders why Bess is showing him things from his past and figures that Bess is somehow trying to give him a second chance. He goes to see his mother, Jessica. She is surprised to see him as he wishes her a happy birthday. When he mentions Bess, she says it was a shame that he let her go. Moore shows his mother the baseball and Jessica says that he stole it, breaking his father's heart. He tries to give it to her but she says it is too late to change things and throws it in the sewer before leaving.

Moore gives his sales meeting but the film is home video of his father Paul making a record of their new home. A teenage Sean and Bess are there, clearly in love. On the film, Sean takes the camera and films his mother and father kissing, and Bess saying she loves him.

He walks out of the meeting and drives to the house, now empty and abandoned. Bess appears behind him and says she hoped she would find him there. Moore says that they had planned to get married and buy the house from his parents, but says it's too late to change things. He wonders what Bess wants to give him now but she says that he has to take what he really needs. Moore turns toward the front door and Bess disappears.

Moore walks inside and finds himself in the past, as a teenager on the day he stole the baseball. The teenage Sean takes the baseball and starts to leave, but hears Bess calling his name. He returns the ball as his parents and Bess arrive. Bess admits she was not sure if he would be there. Sean, given a chance to do things over, leaves with Bess for their date as they plan to go see ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' at the duplex. As Paul asks if he needs any money, Sean says he has everything he needs.

We are charting an unexplored [[star system]] within the [[Zeta Gelis cluster]]. This routine assignment has made for a refreshingly quiet time aboard the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]''.''""   The ''Enterprise'' is exploring an uncharted star system within the [[Zeta Gelis star cluster]], when the ship discovers a faint [[life sign]] and [[debris]] from a small ship [[crash]]ed on one of the planets.   [[Geordi La Forge|La Forge]] is sitting at the [[bar]] in [[Ten Forward]] having drinks with [[Worf]]. La Forge says that he is interested in [[Christy Henshaw]] who is sitting at a nearby table with a friend, but he is too shy to approach her. Henshaw comes over to the bar to leave her and her friend's empty glasses. She tries to strike up a conversation, but La Forge is tongue-tied. Then [[Commander]] [[William T. Riker|Riker]] contacts him from the [[bridge]] and he leaves Worf.    On the surface, the [[away team]] locates the crashed vessel, with a single [[John Doe|badly-injured occupant]]. [[Dr.]] [[Beverly Crusher]] scans him and says that his [[brain stem]] has been damaged and his involuntary nervous functions are not stable enough for transport up to the ship. She asks for a volunteer, and La Forge steps forward.   She establishes a [[neural link]] between La Forge and the alien, to allow La Forge's [[brain]] to regulate both nervous systems and stabilize the alien until they can beam up to the ''Enterprise''. Crusher advises La Forge to breathe normally and that she will terminate the link between them if anything goes wrong. When the connection is made, an energy discharge enters La Forge's mind, and he inhales sharply, but assures Crusher that he's fine. As soon as the alien stabilizes, all three of them are beamed directly to [[sickbay]].  ===Act One=== In sickbay, Dr. Crusher works tirelessly with her staff to stabilize the severely wounded mystery man. On the bridge, Commander Riker reports to [[Captain]] [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] that the crashed vessel appeared to be an [[escape pod]], which means that the ship it came from must have been attacked somewhere close by. [[Data]] detects debris and refined metals in orbit of the [[planet]], indicating the ship was destroyed. Worf also picks up trace elements in the debris consistent with residual phaser fire. Riker shows Picard a small module which is all that is left of the pod's computer system, and Picard gives it to Data for analysis.    Picard visits sickbay to check on the patient's progress, and Crusher reports that he will make a full recovery, due in no small part to his body's quick recuperative powers. She is also troubled to note that his undamaged cells are [[mutation|mutating]], a process that does not seem to be connected to his injuries.   La Forge is in Ten Forward sitting at a table with Worf and Data discussing the salvaged computer module. La Forge and Data present various theories on how to decode it, but Worf is unhappy they are talking shop and not relaxing. La Forge says he is relaxed and has never felt better. He then spots Henshaw and decides to escort her out of Ten Forward to the ship's [[arboretum]]. ""''I have been tutoring him. He learns very quickly''"", a proud Worf tells Data.  :""''[[Medical log]], Stardate 43958.8. I have removed patient John Doe from the emergency bio-support unit. In just thirty-six hours, most of his major organ systems have regenerated themselves to the point where they can now function on their own.''""  In sickbay, the mysterious alien has been removed from intensive bio-support and most of his major [[organ]]s are functioning on their own after only 36 hours. While Dr. Crusher monitors his life signs, he awakens and touches her hand, surprising the doctor. His first words to her are ""''I am alive''"". Crusher remarks that he certainly is. He follows this up by asking ""''Who am I?''""  ===Act Two=== :""''Captain's log, Stardate 43960.6. Our mission to [[map]] the Zeta Gelis star cluster is proceeding on schedule. Meanwhile, Dr. Crusher reports that the recovery of the patient she has named [[John Doe]] continues at a remarkable pace.''""   When the alien finally recovers enough to awaken, he does not know who he is or what led him to be on that planet. The bridge crew attempt to ascertain the mystery of Doe's origins while continuing their work on the charting of the Zeta Gelis star cluster.   Doe has been aboard for over a month, his recuperation speedy and successful, but the doctor is still puzzled by his continuing mutation, which now elicits pain and a glowing energy pulse from his torso. Crusher is frustrated at her inability to solve the mystery or halt the pain, while Doe is contrite about not being able to remember.   Riker is waiting for the [[turbolift]], and when it finally comes, he sees La Forge and Henshaw in a long [[kiss]]. Riker comments that he is having a lot of luck with her. La Forge says that he's still the same old Geordi, but Riker says he's changed. La Forge admits that for the last month, things seem to be going his way and he is a lot more confident than he used to be.   [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien]] comes into sickbay with a [[dislocate]]d [[shoulder]], after [[kayaking]] on the [[holodeck]]. While Crusher is preparing the necessary equipment, Doe drifts over and touches his shoulder. There is another glowing energy pulse, and O'Brien's arm is completely healed, to Beverly and her son [[Wesley Crusher|Wesley]]'s astonishment.  Over dinner with Wesley, Beverly admits that there is something oddly compelling about the mysterious man but denies anything like a ""[[Florence Nightingale]]"" effect (i.e., that she is falling in love with her patient). She feels that she has a spiritual connection with Doe that is different than a romantic one. She tells her son she probably is not making much sense, but Wesley tells her he understands somewhat.  As the bridge crew grow closer to discovering the origins of John Doe, including discovering the coordinates of the planet from which he came from, the alien is starting to remember fragments of his past, namely that he was escaping his planet and that there were others with him. He asks Picard not to return him, at least not yet. Picard states that the ''Enterprise'' will not be in the vicinity of the planet's star system for three weeks, giving Doe ample time to discuss the problem further. After Picard and Crusher leave Doe alone, a powerful yellow glow briefly appears on his body.  ===Act Three=== Doe and Dr. Crusher have some drinks in Ten Forward celebrating Doe's first day out of sickbay. Doe marvels at the diversity of the ''Enterprise'' crew, many different species all working together freely. He tells Crusher that his species is different from this [[philosophy]] somehow. Crusher tells Doe how fond she has become of him and he vice-versa. Doe tells Crusher that he believes he is on some kind of journey and that his mutation in his body is connected to it. He knows he must complete his journey before anything else.  Worf announces to Picard that the ''Enterprise'' will soon be joined by a ship heading to intercept the ''Enterprise'' at high warp. It refuses to answer hails and will intercept in ten hours. Riker tells Picard that whoever is aboard that ship is in a big hurry to intercept the ''Enterprise''.   Now nearly two months on board, Doe's painful and accelerating cellular mutations cause him to fear that what is happening to him may hurt people around him. He flees sickbay after telling Dr. Crusher he must leave the ''Enterprise''. While chasing him down a [[corridor]], Dr. Crusher reluctantly calls for security. As he tries to escape in the [[Type 15 shuttlepod|shuttlepod]] ''[[El Baz]]'', Worf is mortally injured by Doe when he accidentally unleashed his power on him. Worf's [[neck]] breaks on impact after falling hard from high up onto the shuttlebay's floor. Dr. Crusher urgently calls for a resuscitation team to [[Shuttlebay 2]] as John walks over to Worf. He places both of his hands on Worf's neck, and he is miraculously healed by John.  ===Act Four=== In Picard's [[captain's ready room|ready room]], Picard gets Doe to admit he was going to steal a shuttle and asks what is happening to him. Doe does not know, but believes he has to leave the ship before he harms another individual. Picard asks that Doe be kept under constant surveillance.  The [[Zalkonian]] Commander [[Sunad]] finally answers the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s hails and demands the delivery of the stranger from Captain Picard. Allegedly, he is a dangerous criminal who is disturbing the normal order of society on [[Zalkon]] and deserves death. Sunad demands that the ''Enterprise'' leave the Zalkonian system and return John Doe to them. He gives them two hours to make their decision before he fires. Captain Picard, Riker, [[Deanna Troi|Troi]], and Dr. Crusher discuss in the [[observation lounge]] what Doe could be accused of and whether or not they can let personal relationships affect their decision to return this so-called criminal. Crusher remarks on the irony of having saved Doe's life and now to give him back to his people to die for his alleged crimes.  ===Act Five===  Picard tries to negotiate with Sunad, telling him that Doe has exhibited some extraordinary abilities, and would like to know more about the nature of his alleged crimes. Declaring that Doe has ""corrupted"" the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s crew as well, Sunad motions to his bridge crew, and the Zalkonian ship creates some kind of effect that causes every member of the crew to suffocate.   In sickbay, Doe is the only one not affected. He finds Crusher suffocating on the floor and heals her. Helping her to her feet, he declares that he finally remembers who he is and why he is there. Finding another crew member on the floor outside sickbay, Doe heals him as well, then touches a panel, spreading his power throughout the ''Enterprise'' and freeing everyone from the Zalkonian weapon.   As Doe and Crusher enter the bridge, Sunad furiously orders his ship's weapons targeted on the ''Enterprise''. Before it can fire, Doe simply raises a hand, instantly transporting Sunad from his ship's bridge to the ''Enterprise''. Sunad insists to Picard that Doe and his kind are a severe danger to society, but Doe tells Picard the truth: the Zalkonian species is on the verge of an amazing [[Evolution|evolutionary]] change, but Sunad and their society's other leaders, fearful of something they don't understand and perceiving a threat to their authority, have decried the changes as ""evil"" and been murdering any members of their society who exhibit them. Doe and three of his fellows decided to flee Zalkon and let the changes take their course, but only Doe has survived, with the help of the ''Enterprise'' crew.   Doe gasps in sudden pain and undergoes the final [[metamorphosis]], becoming a luminous being of pure energy. He tells Sunad there is nothing to fear, but Sunad recoils in terror. Doe says that they can no longer prevent him from telling the rest of Zalkon what is happening to them. He returns Sunad to his own ship, which quickly departs and heads back to Zalkon.    Doe expresses how glad he was to have found people like those on the ''Enterprise'' but also apologizes to the people on the bridge for needing to leave, especially to Dr. Crusher. Captain Picard states his pride in being present at the birth of a new species, and the new energy life form says goodbye to Crusher before he wafts up and out of the ship into space.  "

[[Beam]]ing down to the planet, [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]], [[Leonard McCoy|McCoy]], and [[Spock]] are attacked by a hovering [[robot]] called [[M-4]]. The [[landing party]] draw their [[phaser]]s to fire back, but find M-4 has somehow neutralized the weapons. An old man arrives to halt the robot's attack, and introduces himself as [[Flint]]. However, he insists to Kirk that the landing party leave at once or die.  ===Act One===  Kirk asks Flint to reconsider but Flint still refuses. As a result, Kirk flips open his [[communicator]] orders that [[Montgomery Scott|Scott]] have the ''Enterprise'' lock [[phaser]]s onto their coordinates. When the situation seems completely hopeless, Flint relents and gives Kirk two hours to obtain the ryetalyn. Flint orders M-4 to gather the ryetalyn. In the meantime, Flint invites the landing party to his impressive home.  When they arrive, Kirk, Spock and McCoy find in the living room what appears to be authentic but undiscovered specimens of [[Earth]] art, such as a score by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] and paintings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. They also come across a [[Gutenberg Bible]] and several works of [[Reginald Pollack]]. The men are unaware that a beautiful young woman wearing a long, elegant silver dress is watching them on a video screen in what appears to be the drawing room. When M-4 returns with the ryetalyn, Kirk prepares to beam back up to the ship but ultimately accepts Flint's offer to process the rare element. It is at this moment that Flint introduces the young woman from the drawing room: his beautiful, highly intelligent, but ultimately enigmatic ward named [[Rayna Kapec|Rayna]], whose beauty immediately attracts Kirk's attention.  ===Act Two=== Flint introduces Rayna to McCoy and Spock. Her first time encountering a [[Vulcan]], she wishes to discuss [[field density]] with him at a later time. Flint explains that Rayna's parents were in his employ and died in an accident. They placed her in his custody and she has been with him ever since. Rayna explains that the landing party are the only other men she has ever seen, which McCoy replies, ""''the misfortune of men everywhere and our privilege.''"" Flint seems to encourage encounters between Kirk and Rayna, such as having them play [[pool|billiard]]s or having them dance while Spock plays the [[piano]].   Kirk recalls to Flint that he had said something earlier about savagery and wonders when was the last time Flint had visited Earth. Flint tells him that Kirk will probably say that it is no longer cruel but he notes that the ''Enterprise'' itself is ""''bristling''"" with weapons and its mission is to colonize, exploit, and destroy if necessary. Kirk replies that their missions are peaceful and their weapons are used strictly for defense. He notes that if they were truly barbarians, they would not have asked for the ryetalyn, they would have simply taken it. He recalls that Flint's own introduction to the landing party lacked a certain benevolence when they arrived.  Kirk is becoming closer to Rayna while they play a game of billiards, and while she teaches him some pointers on the game, Kirk tells Flint that to be Human is to be complex, the species cannot avoid ugliness from within or without. Meanwhile, McCoy returns with the report while Kirk and Rayna are dancing. He reports that the ryetalyn contains [[irillium]] in quantities sufficient enough to render the antidote useless. Flint offers to go with M-4 and collect more samples and to screen them himself. He offers to let McCoy join him.   Later, Kirk enters Flint's laboratory. He is looking around when Rayna enters. He walks over to her and notes that the room became lonely without her. She tells him that loneliness is ""''a thirst. A flower dying in the desert,''"" something Flint had said to her earlier. Kirk does not understand what she is talking about and asks what is in the room behind a closed door in the lab. Rayna does not know, as Flint has told her she must never enter that room. Kirk asks why she is here then, and she tells him she often comes to this place when she is troubled. Kirk asks why she is troubled and also if she is happy here with Flint. She says Flint is the kindest man in the galaxy, but if so, Kirk wonders, why is she troubled? As Kirk leans in to give her a [[kiss]], M-4 arrives and prepares to attack him.  ===Act Three=== Rayna orders the robot to stop, but it does not respond to her command. Just as M-4 prepares to fire on Kirk, Spock enters and vaporizes it with a blast from his [[phaser]]. Later, Flint tells Kirk that the robot was programmed to defend the house and its occupants; it did not anticipate Kirk looking around in the lab. However, another M-4 unit arrives in Flint's living room. He states that it is too useful a device to be without. Flint notes that Kirk should be thankful that he did not attack him, as he has twice the captain's strength, but Kirk remarks that, as Flint had said earlier, it would be an interesting test of power. Rayna is pleased that Kirk did not die in the incident and Flint states that death, when unnecessary, is tragic. He orders that Kirk wait in his study, ""''patiently, safely,''"" while McCoy analyzes the quality of the ryetalyn in the lab. He reminds Kirk that his defense systems operate automatically and not always in accordance with his wishes.  As Flint and Rayna leave, Kirk and Spock realize Flint loves Rayna and is exhibiting [[jealousy]] towards Kirk. However, Kirk points out that Flint seemed to want Rayna and Kirk to participate in activities together, which Spock notes seems to defy male [[logic]] as he understands it. Kirk contacts the ''Enterprise'' and asks for a status on the progression of the Rigelian fever. Scott tells him that the disease has infected nearly everyone on board and they are now operating with a [[skeleton crew]]. Kirk also asks for the report on a computer search on both Flint and Rayna. [[Nyota Uhura|Uhura]] informs him that there are absolutely no past records of Flint and, later, of Rayna.   Kirk and Spock realize that Flint wishes for them to linger for reasons unknown. In the drawing room, Rayna and Flint are watching Kirk and Spock on the video screen. Rayna tells him that she could not have summoned M-4, as she was not frightened. She believes Flint had sent the robot there to kill Kirk, which he vehemently denies. He asks her to say her farewells before Kirk leaves. Rayna sees Kirk again, and the captain tells Spock he will see him in the lab later. She tells Kirk that she has come to say goodbye, but he does not want to. He kisses her, asks her to leave with him and leave Flint. Shortly after, Rayna runs away when Kirk tells her she loves him, not Flint.   Later, in Flint's lab, Kirk meets up with McCoy and Spock. They enter the room that is off-limits to Rayna, where they discover this is Flint has been hiding the processed ryetalyn. Searching for the antidote, the men discover three earlier versions of Rayna: one bald, one brunette, and another unseen under a sheet — indicated by signs reading <small>RAYNA 16</small>, <small>RAYNA 15</small> and <small>RAYNA 14</small> respectively. They realize the woman Kirk loves is not Human; she is an [[android]].  ===Act Four=== Flint then arrives and reveals his other secret; he is an ancient immortal, born almost four millennia before [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], in 3834 BC. Over the course of his long lifetime, Flint has taken on many names, such as Brahms and da Vinci. Eventually, he acquired enough wealth to purchase Holberg 917G and work on a perfect, ultimate &ndash; and equally immortal &ndash; woman. Kirk had provided the final step in her creation, stirring her emotions to life. Flint presses a button on a small remote control device, and the ''Enterprise'' vanishes from the planet's orbit — reappearing the size of a model on a table. An astounded Kirk looks inside the three-foot 'model' starship (his face appearing on the bridge's [[viewscreen]] as he does so) and sees the crew members on the bridge going about their duties but frozen like statues. Flint says he has put the ''Enterprise'' and its crew into suspension and will do the same to Kirk, Spock and McCoy, keeping them and the ''Enterprise'' in that state for a thousand years or more, as Rayna's emotions turn to him. Despite Flint's intent to keep her creation a secret, Rayna enters the room and learns the truth — forcing Flint to  use his remote control to release the ship. The 'model' ''Enterprise'' vanishes from the table, and the full-sized starship reappears in orbit.    Flint and Kirk fight over Rayna, stopped only by the emergence of Rayna's emotions. However, her new feelings and suddenly having to choose between Flint and Kirk overwhelms her, and she shuts down — collapsing to the floor.   Back aboard ship, the [[plague]] is stopped and Kirk finally falls asleep at the desk in his quarters after ruefully reflecting on what had happened. McCoy enters and informs Spock that the full [[tricorder]] readings on Flint indicate he is aging and will eventually die of natural causes. By leaving Earth, he had sacrificed his immortality. After commenting about love and Spock's eschewing of that emotion, the doctor looks at Kirk and wishes the captain could forget Rayna. As McCoy leaves, Spock moves over to his sleeping captain, and places one hand on Kirk's temple. Spock then proceeds to grant McCoy's wish by whispering ""''Forget''"" and using a Vulcan [[mind meld]] to erase Kirk's memory of Rayna — therefore easing his captain's pain.  With the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s crew now cured of the plague, the starship flies on through space toward new adventures. "

[[Jadzia Dax|Dax]] and [[Quark]] are playing [[tongo]] in [[Quark's Bar, Grill, Gaming House and Holosuite Arcade|Quark's]] while the latter is checking on his stock quotes. He then reveals he is practically ruined. Having [[Body Parts (episode)|been banned]] from doing business with other [[Ferengi]], he is unable to invest or manage his money and owes money on multiple loans with the [[bar]] as [[collateral]]. 

Since news of business failures travels fast among Ferengi, Quark's cousin, {{dis|Gaila|Ferengi}}, arrives with a few mocking words and a business offer. Gaila asks Dax to leave so he can have a private conversation with his cousin. He is willing to defy the [[Ferengi Commerce Authority|FCA]] ban and proposes to Quark to go into business with him as a weapons dealer. Gaila just needs Quark for his people skills, offers him 5% of any sales he assists with, and assures Quark that the industry is growing so fast that within a month, all Quark's debts could be paid off, within six months he could have his business license back, and within a year he could own his very own moon. Quark morosely says, ""''What do I have to lose?''""

===Act One===
Meanwhile, [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]] is having problems with his baby son [[Kirayoshi O'Brien|Kirayoshi]]. [[Jake Sisko]] pops by the O'Briens' [[quarters]] and O'Brien explains that while [[Keiko O'Brien|his wife]] is on [[Bajor]] attempting to get a blight under control, his regular babysitter has had an emergency and is unavailable for the time being. To make matters worse, every time he puts Kirayoshi down, he begins to cry. Jake offers to babysit, as he has had experience watching [[Vilix'pran]]'s hatchlings, and O'Brien accepts, as he has to start his shift, but as soon as Kirayoshi is in Jake's arms he begins crying again. O'Brien takes the baby back and he stops crying as soon as he's in his father's arms. With no other choice, O'Brien takes Kirayoshi to work with him.

In the bar, Quark is rocking the chairs checking to see if [[Odo]] is around. He even looks carefully at [[Morn]] to make sure he is not Odo in disguise. Gaila tells him there is nothing to worry about as Odo just walked by. Gaila then introduces Quark to his partner, [[Hagath]], the principal in their weapons-dealing business. Their new angle, they explain, is to conduct demonstrations inside Quark's [[holosuite]]s with holographic replicas of the weapons they are peddling &ndash; thus avoiding any rules against bringing actual weapons aboard the station. Hagath seems to like Quark, but warns him, ""''Don't ever cross me.''"" Quark is also troubled to hear Hagath and Gaila reminiscing over one of their past deals, in which they sold weapons to both sides in the same war.

Quark soon becomes a wizard salesman in the holosuites, and several deals are closed aboard the station. The three [[toast]] to the new relationship.

===Act Two===
Quark's debts are being paid with his percentage from Hagath, who takes the liberty of transferring the money directly to his creditors. Quark protests, but Hagath says he doesn't like his partners to be encumbered by debt (which might divide loyalty or cause complications), which means Quark won't be seeing any actual profits for another few months.

In Quark's, O'Brien is having his weekly [[darts]] game against [[Doctor]] [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]] while still carrying Kirayoshi. Bashir urges O'Brien to put his son down as the chief already has a bad shoulder, but when he does set him down on a table, Kirayoshi cries again. 

While having one of Hagath's female attendants, [[Talura]], skillfully administer ''[[oo-mox]]'', Odo arrives and arrests Quark for dealing weapons on the station. Quark defends himself saying that Odo can't prove a single weapon has been brought on board. Odo insists this is a mere technicality but before he can go further, [[Captain]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] and [[Major]] [[Kira Nerys|Kira]] enter and reluctantly tell him that the [[Bajoran government]] is insistent that the lawful transactions of Hagath and his associates should not be not interfere with, since Hagath supplied arms to the [[Bajoran Resistance]] during the [[Occupation of Bajor|Occupation]]. Odo is outraged, but Sisko says their hands are tied. Quark begins to gloat, but Sisko and Kira furiously make it clear to Quark that the leniency he's been shown in the past is over, and the next chance they get they'll make sure he gets what's coming to him. ""''Something to look forward to,''"" Kira tells Quark before leaving.

In Hagath's quarters, Hagath and Gaila are still chuckling over Hagath's coup. Gaila reminisces that all of their associates thought they were crazy for selling to the dirt-poor Bajorans instead of the wealthy [[Cardassian]]s, but Hagath predicted that the occupation would end one day, and like any successful arms dealer, knows that having a friend in the right place at the right time is sometimes worth more than money. Their conversation is interrupted by one of Hagath's employees, [[Farrakk]], whom Hagath berates for wasting time on [[Risa]] while he was supposed to be closing a deal. Hagath fires the man on the spot. 

Later, Quark notices that his bar no longer has any [[Federation]] customers. Gaila comes and tells Quark that the [[Regent of Palamar]] is coming to the station. The regent is a rich man who is very particular about how he is treated. Quark says he can't wait to meet him. Gaila then compliments Quark and confides that he has decided to [[retire]] and offers Quark the chance to take his place. Quark states that he likes Hagath and would like a bigger share of the profits; but is frightened when Gaila remarks casually that Hagath wasn't satisfied with firing his slacking employee, so he [[sabotage]]d his ship and had him killed.

===Act Three===
At the [[Replimat]], Quark attempts to reconcile with Dax, but she refuses point blank to have anything to do with a weapons dealer. He tries to reason that the weapons he sells are strictly for defense, but Dax asks him that if he has no guilt, then why is he begging her for forgiveness.

Bashir tests Kirayoshi and finds that there is nothing medically wrong with him. O'Brien questions if his baby just gets sad, and then has some [[neck]] pain. 

With Quark's catering services, Hagath hosts a dinner aboard the station for the Regent of Palamar. His former ally, [[General]] [[Nassuc]], has rebelled against him, and the regent needs an appropriate weapon to ""make an example"" of her and her followers. Gaila asks how many casualties is he looking for. The regent wants eight million to start, but then wants the death toll to rise. Gaila again asks for a figure, to which the regent answers around twenty million. Hagath and Gaila discuss what is the best weapon and consider one that should kill twenty-eight million. Quark is very disturbed and asks if they can't just wound some instead of killing twenty-eight million people. The regent gets worried, but Hagath quickly steps in and writes off Quark's question as Ferengi humor. 

On the [[Promenade]], Gaila later confronts Quark. He wants to retire, but can't if his hand picked successor can't control his conscience. Quark thinks Hagath is crazy and that killing twenty-eight million seems wrong. Gaila then has Quark look out the [[viewport|window]] and says that at that very moment, millions of worlds are fighting each other; he asks that if one of those little lights went out, would anyone ''really'' notice? Would Quark really turn down ten million bars of [[latinum]] to turn out one of those lights?

===Act Four===
Quark has a [[nightmare]] in which he is confronted by the ghosts of his former friends, including children like Jake and Kirayoshi, representing the people who have been killed by the weapons he is selling. As a dead Sisko spins the [[dabo]] wheel and tells Quark, ""''you lose,''"" he wakes up screaming, then whispers, ""''What have I done?''""

Captain Sisko enters [[Operations center|Ops]] and sees Kirayoshi sleeping in the engineering pit. O'Brien explains, in a whisper, that as soon as he went down there, Kirayoshi fell asleep in his [[bassinet]] and O'Brien doesn't want to risk waking him. He doesn't know if it's the lights or the hum, but something in the pit pacifies the baby. Sisko, also whispering, tells O'Brien that he can't keep a baby in the pit and gives him a few days off-duty until his wife returns. O'Brien agrees, but asks Sisko if at least they can wait until he wakes up. Sisko reluctantly agrees. By this time, the entire Ops crew (including Dax and Kira) have drifted over to gaze adoringly at the baby's cuteness, and Sisko reminds them all they've got work to do. 

Quark breaks into Dax's quarters to leave the unreceptive [[Trill]] his tongo wheel. She angrily asks him to return it. He tries to tell her what he's going to do, but she refuses to listen. After leaving Dax's quarters, Quark steadies himself in the mirror, reminding himself, ""''The worst Hagath can do, is kill you. What's one life compared to the lives of twenty-eight million people?''"" Quark has decided to sabotage the deal with the regent.

===Act Five===
First, he informs Hagath that their supplier can't fill the regent's order in time, so he proposes that Hagath invite the regent back to the station to preview an alternative. Quark says the alternative will only kill seventeen million people, but that should be enough. (They also mention that all of Quark's debts have been paid, so this is the first deal where he will get his profits in cash.)

At the same time the regent arrives, Quark invites General Nassuc to the station to do a deal on the opposite side of the station. Gaila panics when he finds Quark with her, but Quark says that they have the chance to make an obscene profit by dealing to both sides, and all they have to do is make sure she and the regent never cross paths on the station. Then, he dupes Gaila into conducting General Nassuc into the cargo bay where Hagath and the regent are waiting. As Quark slips out, both sides begin yelling and shooting. Emerging onto the Promenade, Quark casually walks away as Odo and a squad of deputies thunder in the opposite direction towards the cargo bay, hearing reports of [[phaser]] fire. Quark smiles as the squad runs past him.

In his quarters, O'Brien is cradling his son when [[Worf]] enters, reminding the chief he was meant to make modifications to the {{USS|Defiant|2370}}'s [[deflector array]] that day. O'Brien tells Worf that Captain Sisko gave him a few days off and asks Worf to hold his son while he gets his bottle, warning Worf that Kirayoshi will begin to cry as soon as he hands him over. However, as he is held by Worf, Kirayoshi doesn't cry &ndash; O'Brien is astounded and places the baby in his bassinet, where he remains quiet. O'Brien sits down as Worf voices his regret that he didn't see [[Alexander Rozhenko|his own son]] at that age, and tells O'Brien he's a fortunate man. Worf then notices the chief is fast asleep and quickly exits the O'Briens' [[quarters]].

In his office, Captain Sisko informs Quark that he is facing serious criminal charges for all the trouble he's caused. Quark defends his actions, saying he didn't know they were going to start shooting, he just wanted the deal to fall apart. Sisko tells Quark that the regent is dead and Gaila and Hagath have fled the station with a [[purification squad]] after them. Quark tells the captain he can live with the consequences of his actions, and can think of twenty-eight million people who won't shed any tears over the regent's death. Sisko says he can think of twenty-eight million and one, and Quark knows he is forgiven. However, this doesn't stop Sisko from giving him a bill for damages to the cargo bay, which Quark promises to pay in installments in return for the charges against him being dropped.

Quark and Dax later play a conciliatory game of tongo, friends once more. She comments on his ability to get out of tight spots, and he asks for the wheel back, which Dax refuses, saying it's hers now. She spins the wheel again, and they both laugh."
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0," == Summary == === Teaser === ]] For some time, [[Neelix]] has been trying to expand his usefulness; he has been considering roles as an [[engineer]], or a [[security officer]], or some other more official job. With Janeway's assertion that the ship is full of opportunity, he goes to [[Lieutenant]]s [[Tuvok]] and [[B'Elanna Torres]] directly and starts to pester them with questions, though neither has the time.  As the [[crew]] of the {{USS|Voyager}} arrives at a dense, menacing cloud barrier, [[Captain]] [[Kathryn Janeway]] asks Neelix to come to the [[bridge]]. He's able to identify the looming barrier as the [[Nekrit Expanse]].  === Act One === Neelix admits not much is known about the Expanse, and advises caution. Tuvok notes it is too wide to go around. Neelix also points out there is a [[Bahrat's space station|space station]] at the border, though doesn't remember the coordinates. [[Commander]] [[Chakotay]] finds it and Janeway orders a heading for it. Neelix appears to be apprehensive about it. When they get there, they meet the administer, [[Bahrat]], who agrees to discuss their efforts to take on supplies. Interestingly, he insists on monitoring them on the station as well as any communications, and also demands 20% commission on any trades.   While Lieutenant [[Thomas Paris]] and Chakotay visit the main trading post, Janeway arrives to Bahrat's office with a list of supplies she wants. He's obviously busy, but takes a few minutes. He promises to compile a list of potential suppliers. Neelix, meanwhile, meets up with an old friend, [[Wixiban]] (""Wix""), who was in a smuggling operation with him a long time ago, which ended in a run-in with the [[Ubean]]s and landed Wix in [[prison]]. After the jovial reunion, Wix and Neelix get to talking. While Neelix impresses his old friend with the tales of ''Voyager'', he finally admits that he thinks he may not be needed anymore. His knowledge of space goes only as far as the Nekrit Expanse and he is no longer useful as a guide. As a result, he has been trying to acquire a [[map]] of the area on this station. This piques Wix's interest.  === Act Two === On board ''Voyager'', Wix visits Neelix while Neelix was working in his kitchen. Wix was able to help ''Voyager'' to get some magnetic spindle bearings. In private, Wix tells Neelix that he knows where to get [[pergium]] (a rare commodity that ''Voyager'' needs) and a map. He also tells a different story, one of great difficulty and burdensome debts. He is unable to leave the station because his shuttle is being [[impound]]ed by the station master. Playing upon Neelix's sympathies for him, he asks for a favor: he wants Neelix to get a ''Voyager'' [[shuttlecraft]] which he and Wix will use to complete a secret transaction in exchange for the pergium and the map. He explains that he is selling medical supplies to get back his shuttle and wants to do it in secret to avoid the station master's twenty percent cut of the profits. All Neelix has to do is hide this information from the crew. Neelix agrees.  They're successful in obtaining the supplies and come back to the station. Unfortunately, the true nature of the transaction gradually becomes apparent when Wix grabs a [[phaser]] and they meet the potential buyer. He is [[Sutok]], the same man who tried to sell [[narcotic|drugs]] to Chakotay and Paris when ''Voyager'' first docked with the station. From Wix's and Sutok's interaction, Neelix deduces that the medical supplies can actually be used as a narcotic, making this trip not only highly dangerous but highly illegal. Sutok attempts to get the drugs for nothing by trying to kill both [[Talaxian]]s. This results in a firefight and Wix kills Sutok in self-defense. Several unseen [[alien]]s appear, an alarm sounds, and Neelix is knocked down, but the two of them [[beam]] out.  === Act Three === Neelix flies [[Type 6 shuttlecraft 003|the shuttle]] back to ''Voyager'' &ndash; leaving the dead body to be found by Bahrat's men. Neelix is furious at being betrayed but Wix soothes him with more emotional manipulation and convinces him to cover it up and not tell anyone on the ship.   Bahrat informs Janeway that a murder has occurred on the station, and a [[Federation]] phaser's energy signature was detected at the scene. Janeway briefs the senior officers with Bahrat present, promising that ''Voyager'' will give full co-operation during the investigation. Neelix, who is present at the briefing, feels uneasy as Bahrat reveals what he knows so far, which is a lot already.  As part of the investigation, Tuvok questions Neelix about Wix. He distances himself, and doesn't give a lot of information about him. Neelix accompanies Tuvok to the station to interview Wix. Wix gives a cover story of him being asleep at the time of the shootings. After Tuvok has left, Wix tells Neelix that he was acting as an agent for some [[Kolaati]] suppliers in the drug trade. The suppliers, not at all happy with the loss of their drugs, agree to let them live if Wix can get some [[warp plasma]] from ''Voyager''. Neelix immediately says it has gone too far, but Wix appeals to his situation in nearing the end of his time on the ship. He persuades Neelix to help him once again.  === Act Four === On ''Voyager'', Neelix finds Paris in a supply room. While helping to locate a special container for him, he engages him in asking him about why he was in prison. Paris obliges and admits that what got him into trouble in the first place was that he lied after making a mistake and how if he'd told the truth in the beginning things wouldn't have been as bad as they got. The container is found and he leaves, still thinking about his task and leaving Paris a bit confused. He then goes to engineering to complete the task. Torres is not there, but Ensign [[Vorik]] is and so Neelix explains he's just poking around. Still contemplating his situation, he asks Vorik about how he feels about how things turned out on ''Voyager'' generally, and he replies he's found it a good challenge. Neelix then leaves him to get the plasma, but he can't bring himself to do it.   When Neelix and Wix meet at the station at the arranged time, Neelix tells Wix that he couldn't steal from his friends. They are interrupted by Bahrat arresting Chakotay and Paris, who are nearby, charging them with murder and dealing illegal drugs, because they were seen talking with Sutok hours before he was killed. Janeway is furious that Chakotay and Paris were arrested based on circumstantial evidence that does not prove any connection to the crime, but Bahrat is adamant that someone be punished for the crimes by fifty years of [[cryostatic suspension]]. Janeway insists Tuvok be present at the interrogation and promises Bahrat she will not let her officers pay the price for a crime they didn't commit.   However, to save Chakotay and Paris, Neelix devises a plan, which Wix reluctantly agrees to.   === Act Five === He and Wix tell the truth about the incident to Bahrat, who is furious. They are then able to talk their way out of being put into cryostasis by explaining that these smugglers are defeating internal security and that they will help Bahrat and his men catch the criminals when they return for the plasma. Expecting their attempt to be futile, the station master agrees.  Neelix gets a canister from Bahrat with tainted warp plasma and deactivates the safeties. The suppliers, led by [[Tosin]], arrive to meet with Neelix and Wix. When Tosin accepts the canister he realizes that it is worthless but Neelix quickly tells him the canister has been leaking plasma into the room and any energy discharge from his weapon will ignite the entire section. Bahrat arrives and attempts to arrest them but one of the suppliers fires anyways and the ensuing plasma fire knocks Neelix unconscious.  When he reawakens in [[sickbay]], he is told by Tuvok that one of the criminals has been killed and the rest have been taken in to custody by Bahrat, and Wix has gotten his shuttle back and has gone on his way. Janeway arrives and after dismissing the others, demands an explanation from Neelix. Only then does Neelix come clean to the captain as to how the situation arose: he knows nothing about space from this point, so wanted a map and got caught in a cover-up. After a stern lecture from the Captain, Neelix is prepared to accept his fate, which he presumes to be compelled to leave the ship permanently. To his relief (in fact, he is barely able to contain his excitement) the captain explains to him the fact he can no longer be their guide doesn't matter; the [[crew]] is a family, and he cannot simply walk away from his responsibilities. He gladly accepts his sentence of two weeks of cleaning out the ship's exhaust manifolds."
1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"  ==Synopsis== Hermes begin to feel useless for himself and decides to replace his organs with robotic parts.  ==Plot== ===Act I===  [[Hermes]] performs the annual performance review, evaluating each of the [[Planet Express]] employees whereby the lowest rated employee will be fired at sundown. Even though Hermes schemes to fire [[Zoidberg]], the plan backfires. Amy, as the Professor's intern is proved useless, due to the Professor napping all day. Leela is proved useless and could teach Fry or Bender to fly the ship. She notes that Hermes is standing on their air hose and when Hermes releases the air, it pops Fry and Bender's suits, leaving Bender looking normal and Fry naked. Scruffy is pointed useless as well as Zoidberg, but in the end promptly fires himself due to his arrogance and stupidity. As a replacement, the [[Central Bureaucracy]] hires a robot named [[Mark 7G]] to perform the bureaucratic tasks for Planet Express. Zoidberg exclaims that he will miss Hermes despite all the torment and bullying he received because he thought that the insults from Hermes were jokes. Back at his home, Hermes says that the best part of being fired is that he will never have to see Zoidberg again. The family dines on curried goat, which is so spicy that a drop spilled burns through the table, various apartments ([[Ron Whitey]]'s and [[Sal]]'s stomach) and all the way down to [[Robot Hell]], where it burns through the head of the [[Robot Devil]]. Hermes feels sad and talks to his wife, [[LaBarbara Conrad|LaBarbara]], who tries to cheer him up as they go out for a walk. Out of nowhere, [[Roberto]] appears and tries to mug them for their skin, pointing several knives at them. Fortunately, [[URL]] and [[Smitty]] rescue them and sends Roberto to the Electromagnetic Chair where he is executed by a hooded [[C. Randall Poopenmeyer]] (at one point Roberto remarked that the chair was ""driving him sane""). Hermes talks to Bender and as they talk, Fry eavesdrops on their conversation, with a few distractions from Leela and Amy, who are naked in the shower. Later that night, Bender brings Hermes [[Yuri]], who runs a black market selling used robotic and organic parts and is able to do body augmentation. Hermes gets a harpoon installed in his chest.  ===Act II===  Hermes shows his new attachment, which impresses the crew and helps to get his job back. As Zoidberg greets Hermes, who starts to become mean to him again as always, [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] drops his dentures down in the sink and Bender shows how easily it could be retreived by an extending arm, convincing Hermes that he should get one. Hermes pays Yuri a visit again, replacing his left arm with a robotic extendable arm and shows off its numerous attachments after Farnsworth again drops his dentures into the insinkerator. Zoidberg asks for and takes Hermes' organic left arm. Back in his dumpster, Zoidberg is shown playing with a makeshift puppet of Hermes, fitting Hermes's old arm onto it. In bed that evening, Hermes breaks his glasses with his new robotic hand and decides to get a Cylon eye instead, surprising his wife [[LaBarbara Conrad|LaBarbara]]. Hermes smooths it over and the two are about to make love, when LaBarbara realizes that Hermes also Cyloned his private area. LaBarbara makes him promise that he will not upgrade any further, but he crosses his robotic fingers behind his back.  Soon after, Hermes breaks his promise to LaBarbara and has upgraded all of his body parts except for his brain. Zoidberg has been collecting Hermes' old body parts, prompting Hermes to ask what he plans to do with them and Zoidberg replies ""something wonderful"". Zoidberg laments that the new and improved Hermes doesn't joke with him the way he used to. The Hermesbot couldn't care less what Zoidberg does at this point. It is revealed that Zoidberg has sewn all of Hermes' discarded parts together to create ""Little Hermes"", a puppet whom he uses in his comedy ventriloquist act where Little Hermes insults him much as Hermes did when he was organic. Everyone thinks Little Hermes is funny and Dr. Zoidberg is funny for the first time, but the now emotionless and arrogant Hermesbot finds it disgusting and decides to make the ultimate and completely suicidal decision: getting a robot brain, which will kill any remaining humanity. Hermes pays a visit to Yuri again, but this time, the surgeon refuses to fulfill Hermes' request, stating that he's out of his mind. Later, Hermes visits the robot cemetary together with Professor Farnsworth and Bender, where they stumble upon a fresh grave. The grave is then exhumed and Professor Farnsworth retrieves the brain circuit in it. As they leave, it is revealed that the grave belongs to the recently executed Roberto.  ===Act III===  Back at Planet Express, Professor Farnsworth and the crew prepare for surgery, as Zoidberg performs a quick comedy session with Little Hermes. LaBarbara shows up with Dwight and demands that the surgery is stopped. Hermes points out that a robot brain would make him a better husband and father, but LaBarbara replies that he can't be a husband and father without a wife and son and commences divorce proceedings. Professor Farnsworth then gets emotional and refuses to perform the surgery because he knows that the procedure will kill Hermes. Hermesbot locks the crew inside the Planet Express building until they perform the brain swap. Zoidberg says he will do it, using Little Hermes' fingers for dexterity. The rest of the crew wonder why Zoidberg wants to perform such a risky and suicidal surgery on Hermes, even with the threat of death by Hermesbot and Zoidberg answers them in a musical way. Amy asks if anyone else thinks that is it strange that Dr. Zoidberg can harmonize with himself while singing.  The surgery is successful and LaBarbara is upset. As LaBarbara berates Dr. Zoidberg for performing the operation, Zoidberg puts Hermes' brain into Little Hermes and Hermes is once again fully human, apologizing to LaBarbara for breaking his promise to her. As they share a kiss together, Roberto awakens in Hermes' robot body. He captures Hermes and peels part of his skin with the robot arm's vegetable peeler attachment, then eats it. Roberto ends up melting completely due to Hermes' goat curry saturated skin, killing him instantly. LaBarbara then asks Hermes to apologize to Zoidberg for being a jerk to him and to thank him for saving Hermes and Labarbara's marriage. Hermes does so despite him stating that he hates Zoidberg so much and how they've never been friends. Zoidberg then decides to stand up to Hermes after hearing that both of them have ""never been friends"" and uses Hermes as a puppet again. He then says ""Ouch! What a zinger! Well I got one for you Mr. Not my friend Conrad. You acted like a big jerk! You were selfish and stupid and you don't deserve a wife like Labarbara or a friend like me"". Everyone around the room then laughs and Zoidberg then leaves the place dancing to his ""Monster Mash"" spoof, much to the chagrin of Amy, who again, asks aloud whether anyone else is weirded out by Zoidberg harmonizing with himself as he sings.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"  ==Summary== ===Teaser=== In [[Quark's]], [[Quark]] observes an incoming shipment of [[syrup of squill]]. It had been previously thought to be nearly unavailable for the last year due to a [[drought]] on the [[planet]] [[Balancar]]. Quark explains to his customers how he had learned there was in fact no drought and that it was merely a ruse to drive up prices. Quark had then demanded a shipment of syrup or he would ""''expose their deception to the entire [[Alpha Quadrant|quadrant]]''"".  Quark's customers are impressed, though his moment of glory is short-lived. [[Jadzia Dax|Dax]], [[Doctor]] [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]], and [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien|O' Brien]] enter, having just returned from taking the {{USS|Defiant|2370}} on a mission behind enemy lines in [[Cardassian]] space, the first reconnaissance mission into the area since the Dominion's retreat. Quark complains to [[Constable]] [[Odo]] about the [[Starfleet]] officers stealing away his audience. Odo points out they're not just Starfleet officers, they're heroes. Quark is then interrupted by [[Broik]] who comes with a message from [[Grand Nagus]] [[Zek]] from [[Ferenginar]].  Quark finds [[Rom]] working in an access tube and gives him troubling news: Their [[mother]] [[Ishka]] has been captured by the [[Dominion]]. What's worse, Zek wants Quark to rescue her.  ===Act One=== Quark explains that Moogie was returning home from a lobe-lift on {{dis|Vulcan|planet}} when her transport was attacked by [[Dominion]] forces, taking her prisoner. He says the Nagus offered a reward of fifty {{dis|bar|latinum}}s of gold-pressed [[latinum]], which Quark will share with Rom for his participation: thirty bars for himself and twenty for Rom, the difference representing his finder's fee.  Rom suggests they hire the toughest mercenaries they can find: [[Nausicaan]]s, [[Breen]], [[Klingon]]s. Quark has another idea, however: the rescue team will be made up only of [[Ferengi]]. Rom is nervous but Quark believes Ferengi can be just as tough as Klingons with the right incentive. Being a typical Ferengi himself, however, they'll say the reward the group will share is only ''twenty'' bars of latinum. With that, they seek out their first recruit.  [[Nog]] immediately declines, explaining that he's now a Starfleet officer and has duties to perform. Quark, however, points out that he could be the team's [[Strategic operations officer]], just like {{Commander}} [[Worf]]. They suggest he could train the team for combat. Nog finally agrees, with the team becoming three.  Before contacting their next recruit, Quark tells Rom that [[Leck]] is not a typical Ferengi: his priorities are different. When the two reach Leck on a secure [[subspace]] channel, Rom learns that Leck is an ""[[Eliminator]]"". He initially has no interest in joining the team or even in earning latinum. He does, however, enjoy testing his abilities with a challenge and agrees to join when he learns they'll be facing the Dominion. The team is now four.  Next they travel to a [[Gaila's prison starbase|starbase]] to pick up their cousin {{dis|Gaila|Ferengi}}, who has fallen on hard times since they [[Business as Usual (episode)|last met]]. The weapons dealer who was once so wealthy, he owned his own [[moon]] was recently arrested on [[Thalos VI]] for [[vagrancy]]. Gaila blames his misfortune entirely on Quark. When he learns Quark paid for his release and his offer to earn some latinum, Gaila's vengeance is overcome by greed and he too agrees to join. The team is now five.  Back at the bar on [[Deep Space 9]], Nog attempts to show them a schematic of a Dominion internment center, but soon gets into an argument with Leck over Leck's refusal to call him ""sir"" and finally quits. As Quark urges him to stay, Gaila asks how they're supposed to get to the internment center anyway, since they have no ship. As Quark tries to soothe things over, a loud clapping is heard and [[Brunt]] emerges from the other end of the bar.  Brunt initially mocks the group but quickly announces his intention to sign up as well. Having lost his job as a [[Liquidator]] for the [[FCA]] [[Ferengi Love Songs (episode)|after trying to usurp Zek]], he hopes that by helping to save Ishka, the Nagus would give him his job back. None of the others want him on board though; none of them like liquidators and it would mean smaller shares of the ""twenty bar reward"". ""''Fine,''"" Brunt says, innocently. ""''I'll just get in my ''ship'' and leave.''"" The team is now six.  ===Act Two=== In a [[holosuite]] simulation, Nog has the team engage a group of three [[Jem'Hadar]] soldiers guarding Ishka with disastrous results: Quark is shot in the leg, Gaila drops his weapon and runs away, Rom runs into a wall, Brunt tries to surrender but is shot as well. The only one to get off a shot is Leck, who instead shoots Ishka!  ""''I saw we weren't going to rescue her so I put her out of her misery,''"" he says. Brunt suggests starting off with something simpler like ambushing [[Bolian]]s, but a frustrated Quark simply sends them all away.  Back down in the bar, Quark tells Rom they don't have a chance of rescuing their mother. As he reminisces about his impressive deal acquiring squill a few days earlier, Rom suggests perhaps instead of trying to fight the Dominion, they should lean into their peoples' strong points and negotiate instead. Quark agrees, deciding a trade is better since everyone goes home happy and alive. The two think about what they have to trade.   Quark later thanks [[Captain]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] and [[Major]] [[Kira Nerys|Kira]] for talking to Starfleet on his behalf and giving him a prisoner to exchange. Kira tells him it is payback for [[Sacrifice of Angels (episode)|freeing her from the Dominion]]. Kira also warns Quark not to turn his back on this prisoner; he's not to be trusted. ""''Neither am I'',"" Quark says confidently.  Aboard [[Brunt's shuttle]], Gaila questions why Quark still needs any of them now that the rescue mission has become a simple prisoner exchange. ""''Because he doesn't trust the Dominion, and neither do I'',"" Leck says. Nog mentions that he [[Empok Nor (episode)|has been]] at [[Empok Nor]] before and tells them Quark chose the deserted [[Cardassian]] space station as the location for the trade because it is [[Terok Nor type|the same design]] as Deep Space 9, therefore they know the layout.  Quark then enters with their prisoner: [[Keevan]] (the [[Vorta]] captured by Captain Sisko [[Rocks and Shoals (episode)|months earlier]]). Keevan urges them all to send final messages to their loved ones and make sure their wills are in order ""''because the moment we leave the station you'll have signed your death warrants.''""  ===Act Three=== The shuttle arrives at [[Empok Nor]] and Nog confirms the station being empty with his [[Starfleet tricorder|tricorder]]. He tells the others to set up [[base camp]] in the station's [[infirmary]], though they're slow to respond until Quark offers two slips of latinum for the first man who makes it to the door. Nog tells Quark that one does not pay soldiers to do their duty. ""''You do if they're Ferengi,''"" Quark responds.  Leck grumbles about the small size of the infirmary while Gaila complains about an upset stomach. Leck, noticing Keevan's glib responses, points out the Vorta doesn't seem happy at the prospect of rejoining his people. Keevan sourly informs them that, since Vorta are expected to commit [[suicide]] rather than be captured, the only things he has to look forward to upon rejoining his people are ""a most unpleasant debriefing,"" followed by summary execution.  Hours later, five of the Ferengi are awaken by Gaila's screaming. During his shift to guard Keevan, Gaila had fallen asleep and let him escape. The Ferengi quickly rush back to the shuttle where Keevan is unsuccessfully trying to start it. Fortunately, Quark had Rom disengage the induction matrix after they arrived. He still ran, however, because ""''sometimes my brother gets things wrong.''""  Moments later, an alarm sounds, stating that a Dominion ship is approaching. The Ferengi, along with Keevan, hurry back to the infirmary and hide. After a few moments, Nog volunteers to take a look outside. Peeking out the door, he sees a legion of Jem'Hadar, their weapons all aimed at the infirmary. Immediately Nog shuts the door. Quark comes around the corner and asks if anybody's there. Nog tells his uncle that he could say that.  ===Act Four=== Nog finally asks the other Ferengi, still cowering in the corner why they're hiding from the Jem'Hadar. They did ask them to come, after all. Brunt agrees and tells Quark all he needs to do is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Keevan tells them their only hope to is to get back to the ship and escape, but Nog tells him they're not going anywhere without their Moogie. Quark then heads out onto the [[Promenade]] with Rom and Nog in tow.  As they three step out, they see Ishka, guarded by another Vorta named [[Yelgrun]] and flanked by two Jem'Hadar guards. Quark tells them, he's willing to arrange the trade, but needs some assurance first. He wants all the Jem'Hadar off the station, though he concedes to letting Yelgrun's two guards stay. Then, he'll have their ship head back to Dominion territory at warp nine. This will leave Yelgrun stranded on the station for a few days, giving the Ferengi more than enough time to get away safely before they return.  Yelgrun threatens to have the Jem'Hadar storm the infirmary and kill them all, but Quark tells him that Keevan would be the first to die. His fate may be sealed either way but Yelgrun likely wants to know what Dominion secrets Keevan revealed to the [[Federation]] first. Yelgrun is impressed with Quark's cunning and agrees to the deal, telling them to be ready in thirty minutes. Before they leave, however, Nog wants to know how they know it is really Ishka and not a [[Changeling]] impostor. Nog cuts her hand with a [[knife]], proving it is her, and getting a few angry cuffs from his grandmother in the process.  Back in the infirmary, the Ferengi are in good spirits over the success of the deal. They reminisce about going home to Ferenginar, with its torrential rains, rotting vegetation, dampness, and rivers of muck, much to Keevan's disgust. Their good mood is interrupted, however, when Rom accidentally reveals the reward money is fifty bars instead of the twenty they were promised. This infuriates Brunt, Gaila, and even Leck, who may not care about latinum but doesn't like being cheated. An enraged Gaila raises his weapon and shoots at Quark. Quark and the others duck out of the way and the blast hits Keevan instead. With a smoking hole in his chest, the fatally wounded Vorta says ""''I hate Ferengi''"" before falling to the floor, dead.  The Ferengi all gather around the dead Keevan before looking back up at Gaila. ""''You idiot'',"" Leck finally grumbles.  ===Act Five=== The Ferengi sit around lamenting their situation: they'll likely be killed when Yelgrun learns the truth. Gaila suggests surrendering, Brunt suggests trying to escape in his ship, and Rom suggests hiding. Quark is offended by this, reminding them of the [[Battle of Prexnak]], the most important battle in Ferengi history, when ten Ferengi stood alone against two hundred seventy-three [[Lytasian]]s. Gaila, however, points out that all ten Ferengi were slaughtered. Quark, unswayed, tell them this is their chance to prove that Ferengi are as tough as any species in [[Milky Way Galaxy|the galaxy]].  Leck soundly agrees, though Brunt and Gaila only join in on a condition of equal shares of the fifty bars of latinum. ""''Fifty bars it is,'' Quark says, ""''minus my usual finder's fee.''""  During all this, Nog has been examining Keevan's body, finally deciding that he can't be revived. As he places a [[neural stimulator]] on Keevan's head, Keevan's right arm swings around and hits Nog. Nog explains that the neural stimulator caused a reflexive impulse in his [[cerebellum]]. ""''If you think about it, medicine isn't that different from engineering,''"" he says. ""''It's all about keeping things running, fixing broken parts.''"" As the six Ferengi begin to form a plan, Yelgrun announces it is time for the exchange. Nog tells Quark to stall for time until he can get more neural stimulators.  Quark hurries out and tells them he'll need a few more minutes for Rom to do a sensor scan of the station to confirm the Jem'Hadar are gone. Yelgrun is furious at this latest delay and threatens to have Ishka killed. Quark begs him not to. ""''And I thought the [[Breen]] were annoying'',"" Yelgrun says. Quark also asks if they can make the exchange at the docking bay since that's where his ship is. Yelgrun has no choice but to agree.  Quark hurries back in, where Nog is using the stimulators to animate Keevan's corpse. With a signal from his [[tricorder]], the dead Vorta suddenly sits up and opens his eyes.  In a corridor at the docking bay, Ishka and Yelgrun are discussing investing in [[hypicate]] roots when Quark arrives with the upright Keevan. They each send their prisoners walking (Keevan with help from Nog, who is off to the side, sending signals from his tricorder). Yelgrun watches Keevan's stiff movements as he walks towards him. ""''What have they done to him?''"" he asks. Ishka makes it safely into Quark's arms, but Keevan walks into a wall and keeps walking into it again and again.  Quark and Ishka rush to find cover. Yelgrun yells for his Jem'Hadar to stop them, but before they can, a door goes up, revealing Leck and Gaila. Leck flicks his knife into the chest of one of the Jem'Hadar, killing him. As Yelgrun ducks, and the remaining Jem'Hadar soldier turns on Leck and Gaila, Rom and Brunt appear at the other end of the corridor and blast him with their phaser rifles.  Ishka tells Quark the Grand Nagus will be proud of him, as she is. Quark tells them they'll take Yelgrun with them. ""''He'll be our gift to Starfleet. They gave us a Vorta, we'll give them one.''""  Leck notes this was the sloppiest, most amateurish operation he'd ever seen, then adds, ""''If you ever do something like this again,''"" he says, ""''count me in.''""  Rom asks his brother how it feels to be a hero. ""''You tell me,''"" Quark says. ""''It feels good?''"" Rom suggests. Quark smiles. ""''You bet it does!''""  With that, they board the shuttle and head out, leaving Keevan's body still walking into the wall. "

However, there is no certificate, but states his mother was admitted to the maternity ward that morning.   Travers appears and tells the crew that he was born the next day and that he time-traveled back from the year 3028. In the future where the fence Nixon builds did keep out aliens, but there is an unforeseen side effect of this fence: there is no longer a source of ""cheap alien labor,"" specifically for important jobs such as farm workers, math teachers and ""the ones that do all the immunizations"" (doctors). The economy soon collapses, and Nixon turns the ""Silent Majority"" into Soylent Majority, a take on Soylent Green.

==Summary==
===Introduction===
In [[hyperspace]], the combined fleet of the [[Earth Alliance Resistance]] and its alien supporters gathers in preparation for the push to [[Mars]]. Aboard a [[Minbari]] ship, a mortally wounded [[Susan Ivanova]] lies comatose, watched over unceasingly by [[Marcus Cole]]. [[Delenn]] enters the room and informs him a transport has arrived to take her to [[Babylon 5]], as there is no chance to treat her without its resources. Though reluctant to leave, he eventually leaves to assume his post. Delenn hesitates in leaving, as she too feels the shock of probably losing such a close friend as Ivanova.

On Mars, Dr. [[Stephen Franklin]] records a log:

: ""''November 1st, 2261, Doctor's Personal Log &ndash; We're ready. We're starting the final strike to free Earth and Mars. I don't know if this is gonna work, but it's gonna be one hell of a fight either way.""''

He and [[Lyta Alexander]] have been coordinating with [[Number One]] and the [[Mars Resistance]] in their part of the upcoming battle. Among one of the more unusual things being done is the transport of some 30 coffin-sized cases with the [[telepath]]s altered by the [[Shadow]]s. With the help of an insider named [[Kelley]], they are being transported into the [[Earthforce]] ships that are loyal to President [[Morgan Clark]], one to each. Kelley (and Number One) are puzzled as to why they are transporting people in cryo units, and Franklin explains they are a way around the loyalists detecting weapons and that their effectiveness will be revealed soon.

A little later, on the Martian surface, they link up with [[Michael Garibaldi]] who was scouting ahead. Using code names based upon ''Snow White'', he orders strike teams to advance on three ground stations surrounding the spaceport while his group advances on a fourth. Meanwhile, shuttles commence delivering final provisions (including the cryo pods) to the loyalists in orbit.

===Act I===
At Ground Station Alpha, Earthforce soldiers keep a cautious watch. They know something is coming and are figuring the Mars Resistance to play a role. The station commander tries to contact Station Bravo but does not get a reply. Before he can wonder what is happening, one of the officers puts on a breather and draws a [[PPG]] on him. At the same instant, the exterior door bursts open. After a brief fistfight, Garibaldi and his strike team subdue the remaining officers, give them breathers, throw them outside, and secure the door behind them. The insider compliments Garibaldi on their efficiency. With luck, the other teams achieved similar success, meaning they effectively control the spaceport perimeter and the base itself does not know. Once the base re-pressurizes and the door controls removed to prevent enemy re-entry, everyone removes their breathers. Garibaldi observes the last of the shuttles depart the spaceport, meaning they will deliver their cargo to the destroyers in forty-five minutes. With a timeframe established, Franklin and Alexander make preparations. Franklin removes a strange piece of headgear and puts it on Alexander.

Aboard his old (and now current) flagship, the {{EAS1|Agamemnon}}, Captain [[John Sheridan]] enters the bridge and announces that the final battle to liberate the [[Earth Alliance]] is imminent.

: ''""We're one jump from more trouble than most of you have seen during your years in Earthforce. It is my supreme hope that, in all the years after this, we may never see a day like this again.""''

He contacts the rest of the fleet and relays the battle plan. The first objective is to neutralize Mars so as not to be flanked. Then they will move for Earth. To maintain the ""clean fight,"" the [[White Star fleet]] (all with human commanding officers) and the Resistance destroyers will carry out the fighting. The alien supporters will maintain a support role: acting only defensively. After ordering the fleet to await further orders, he disconnects everyone but Cole. He will lead the advance strike as soon as Garibaldi relays some necessary information.

In Mars orbit, the last of the Clark loyalist fleet assemble for a last stand and receive shipments from planetside. The fleet flagship is the {{EAS1|Apollo}}, commanded by General [[Robert Lefcourt]], an old instructor of Sheridan's and a firm believer in the supreme authority of the law, no matter who is in charge. All the loyalist ships have had their IFF systems updated to recognize Resistance destroyers as foes, and deadly force is authorized. The force of 35 destroyers assembles, waiting for the battle to begin.

===Act II===
The headpiece Franklin is applying on Alexander is a psionic amplifier. She is about to engage in a ''very'' long-range telepathic scan, and even with help from the amplifier, she needs to be outside to get enough reach. Meanwhile, Garibaldi uploads some data to ""Snow White"" (Cole).

Even as he awaits the order to begin, Cole cannot stop thinking about Ivanova. Although the others like [[Lennier]] appear to be consigned to fate, Cole cannot help but think there is something they have not thought about. Just then, the data from Garibaldi comes in as well as the go-ahead.

At Station Alpha, Garibaldi orders everyone to take cover. It is then that he reveals that what he had given Cole was planetary coordinates accurate to within feet: the kind of data one needs to successfully pull off a jump directly into an atmosphere. Even as Number One and the others listen in disbelief, the jump vortex appears and the atmosphere rumbles with the turbulence. Cole in his ''White Star'' emerges and strafes the spaceport. Noticing one turret still active, Number One orders the station's guns destroy that turret before it can fire on Cole.

In space, Captain Mitchell reports on the attack, but Lefcourt orders no action. He assumes it to be a feint meant to draw some of the ships away from the main line. He is patient and wonders what Sheridan's next move will be: in particular, what kind of ""ace in the hole"" he will employ.

Even as explosions rock the spaceport, Sheridan relays a message to Alexander: ""Do it."" Alexander stands and looks out into space. Her eyes begin to turn black from the intense psychic exertion. Inside, Franklin explains what is happening right now. She is reaching out to the cryo units sent to the destroyers. She is touching each of them, awakening them. Reprogrammed to become the central core of a [[Shadow vessel]], they instinctively get up and move towards a computer interface, so as to merge with it and take control. The insider is shocked at the callous way Franklin describes such horror, but Franklin is only this way because he has surrendered to the inevitable. Without the technology available back home on Earth, there is no hope of removing the Shadow implants, meaning they are as good as dead. By employing them in this way, they can serve in the most humane way possible. By taking over the computers, they can disable up to thirty destroyers without having to kill the crew, and perhaps open the way to free their comrades from their enslavement. Thirty lives to save over thirty thousand.

===Act III===
Sheridan receives word that Alexander's activated the telepaths. He gives the go-ahead for the main assault. Lefcourt looks on as a swarm of jump vortices herald the arrival of Sheridan's fleet as predicted. Suddenly, the ''Apollo''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> computer goes dead. Word reaches him that the same thing is happening to most of the fleet. Before Lefcourt can order any able destroyer to advance, communications go dead. Lefcourt suddenly realizes this was what the feint had covered up: a sneak attack brought aboard with their last supply run.

Aboard a [[Sharlin]]-class ship, Delenn reports on the enemy's status. To Sheridan's relief, she reports that the telepaths did their job. Twenty of the destroyers are disabled and five more are losing control, leaving ten active destroyers to fight. Using the chaos to his best advantage, he orders the White Stars to concentrate on the remaining destroyers, crippling them before they can take action. Meanwhile, destroyer security forces begin to encounter the telepaths. Though the telepaths fight back with arcs of electricity, one by one, the security forces take down the telepaths. However, the damage is done. Within minutes, the loyalist fleet is neutralized with few casualties. The [[Battle of Mars]], such as it is, is over.

The way is now clear to move to Earth. Sheridan orders Delenn and the alien forces to remain at Mars to assist any vessels whose condition deteriorates further. As Cole's ''White Star'' leaves Mars and rejoins the main fleet Cole himself leaves the bridge to see to personal matters. In another room, Cole accesses the Babylon 5 archives, seeking out any references to treating mortal injuries. Once the fleet is assembled, Sheridan sets the jump target: Earth Beacon 11629.

Cole's search request completes, and he eventually comes across Franklin's log of healing Garibaldi with the [[Alien Healing Machine]]. In spite of Franklin's recorded warnings about its life-transferring nature, Cole orders a shuttle prepared.

Mitchell reports the killing of the telepath, but they are still dead in space and without external communications. Angrily, Lefcourt orders repairs completed with all possible speed.

To her surprise, Lennier reports to Delenn's Sharlin, claiming to be answering a summons from her. Before either can realize what just happened, Cole turns his ''White Star'' around and leaves the fleet. Lennier begins to suspect what happened.

===Act IV===
Delenn tells Sheridan that Cole went AWOL and has gone back to Babylon 5. Sheridan fumes, but as he continues the conversation in private on an earpiece, he realizes Cole has learned about the machine, but Sheridan cannot send anyone to pursue him. Time is critical at this point and the final push must proceed. Regretfully, he orders the final jump.

As the Earth Alliance Resistance jumps into Earth orbit, Sheridan begins a transmission to all Earth frequencies:

: ''""This is Captain John Sheridan. We are here on the authority of a multiplanetary force that can no longer stand by and watch one of their greatest allies falling into darkness and despair. We are here on behalf of the thousands of civilians murdered under orders from the current administration, who have no one else to speak for them, and on behalf of the Earthforce units that have joined us to oppose the tyranny that has darkened Earth ever since [[Luis Santiago|President Santiago]] was assassinated three years ago. We are here to place President Clark under arrest, to disband [[Nightwatch]], and return our government to the hands of her people.""''

As he speaks, President Morgan Clark writes on his desk and the [[Planetary defense grid|planetary defense grid]] begins to turn to the fleet. Sheridan continues:

: ''""We know that many in the government have wanted to act but have been intimidated by threats of retaliation against your families, your friends. You are not alone anymore. We call upon you to rise up and do what's right. We have drawn their forces away from Earth and disabled them. The time to act is now.""''

Emboldened by the declaration, the Earth Resistance finally takes action. An Earthforce squad led by Senator [[Crosby]] marches on the President's Office.

: ''""This is not the voice of treason. These are your sons, your daughters, whose loyalties have never wavered, whose beliefs in this Alliance has forced us to take extraordinary means. For justice, for peace, for the future, '''we have come home'''!""''

As the resistance forces approach, Clark finishes his writing and arms the defense grid. Soon a salvo of missiles launches from the platforms. Sheridan orders evasive action and the Starfury squadrons launched to intercept the missiles. He then orders the destroyers to target the platforms. Back on Earth, with the resistance attempting to break down the doors, Clark draws a PPG from his desk, aiming it at his head. Just as the Resistance breaks through, he fires. As the battle in orbit continues, Crosby notices the writing on the desk. Clark had written the line, ""The Ascension of the Ordinary Man"" again and again on the sheet, except that some of the letters had been circled.

Sheridan soon receives a transmission. It's Crosby. She reports that Clark committed suicide. More importantly, she reports what the circled letters spell out: ""Scorched Earth."" She has learned that Clark has programmed the defense grid's particle beam cannons to turn toward Earth and set them to fire in ten minutes. He intended to take the entire planet with him. Upon hearing this, Sheridan orders all ships to target the defense grid, and immediately calls in Delenn and the alien fleet for assistance. The defense grid fights back, and many ships from all races involved are destroyed. The ''Agamemnon'' itself is critically damaged with no weapons systems, but ahead of it is the final platform about to fire on the North American Eastern Seaboard. With no other ships able to assist, Sheridan grimly orders ramming speed on the platform. Just then, the ''Apollo'' jumps in, and Lefcourt comes to Sheridan's aid. The ''Apollo'' fires on the platform and destroys it just in time for the ''Agamemnon'' to ride through the fireball. Soon, the news reaches him: mission accomplished. Earth is saved. Although Lefcourt tells Sheridan he still has to face a court martial, he also welcomes Sheridan back home to Earth.

===Act V===
Captain James relays the news that Sheridan is wanted planetside as soon as possible. Delenn will join him later, but Dr. Franklin has already left Earth, hoping to keep Cole from committing ""a terrible mistake.""

[[ISN]] &ndash; the ''real'' ISN &ndash; returns to the air for the first time in over a year. Still choked with emotion, reporter [[Jane]] begins by speaking on behalf of the rest of the ISN crew, describing the imprisonment, torture, and sometimes death they endured. All that came to an end this morning. She then reports the breaking news: that of Sheridan's successful [[liberation of Earth]]. She goes on to keep the civilians on Earth calm, telling them that EarthGov is still working to compile the list of casualties. The [[Earth Alliance Civil War]] is now over, and it now time for humans to come back together and begin the process of healing and rebuilding.

Aboard a ''White Star'', Franklin frantically tries to contact Babylon 5 without success. In between, he replays the log entry that sent Cole on his mad dash. Back on Babylon 5, though, Cole's mad dash comes to its grim conclusion. Even as the Alien Healing Machine drains the life force out of him to resuscitate Ivanova, Cole, in his final words, declares his love for her.

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"== Summary == === Teaser === The mood aboard [[Deep Space 9]] has grown dark as the [[Dominion]] threat has intensified. Three ships, including the {{USS|Tian An Men}}, have disappeared along the [[Cardassian border]] in just the last three weeks, [[Odo]] has canceled a vacation to [[Bajor]] due to an 75% increase in thefts of food rations and medical supplies, and the crew is generally gloomy &ndash; [[Captain]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] most of all. What's more, [[Kai]] [[Winn Adami]] announces she'll be visiting the station. Fortunately, [[Jake Sisko]] has a plan to lift his father's spirits &ndash; [[Quark]] has invited him to an [[auction]] at which a mint-condition [[Willie Mays]] [[1951|rookie year]] [[baseball card]] will be available. He'll show up, purchase the card, and make a gift of it. ""''How hard can that be?''"" Jake asks.  === Act One === Jake convinces [[Nog]] to let him use some of the [[gold-pressed latinum]] he's saved up over his lifetime so he can purchase this gift for the captain, by guilting him through a reminder that the captain [[Heart of Stone (episode)|made it possible]] for Nog to attend [[Starfleet Academy]]. Meanwhile, Kai Winn meets with Captain Sisko and reveals that the [[Dominion]] has requested a meeting with her. Kai Winn requests that Sisko take a walk with her on the [[Promenade]]. Both Sisko and the Kai are concerned about how [[Bajor]] will be able to cope with a pending Dominion invasion. The Kai tells Sisko that she is concerned that, with the conflict between the Dominion and the Federation quickly escalating, Bajor could get caught in the middle and would result in the destruction of her world. Sisko promises that he will do whatever it takes to safeguard Bajor.  Meanwhile, at the auction, the baseball card Jake desires comes up for auction. It is included in an [[Andorian chest]] along with a [[pre-Surak]] [[Vulcan]] [[bracelet]], a [[6th century]] [[Bajoran mandala]], and a [[23rd century]] [[ion-transtator]]. Bidding begins on the contents of the chest but Nog's entire life savings isn't enough to out-bid a mysterious man at the back of the room. He bids 10 bars of latinum (twice what Nog has saved) and then disappears out the back.  === Act Two === Nog tries to convince Jake they've lost the card, but Jake is determined to come through for his father. They intercept the man as he leaves the auction in [[Quark's Bar, Grill, Gaming House and Holosuite Arcade|Quark's]] but he mutters something about refusing to get involved with any ""soulless minions of orthodoxy"" and disappears into a [[turbolift]].  Meanwhile, [[Weyoun 5|Weyoun]] arrives on the station to meet with Kai Winn and exchanges insults with Sisko.   Finally, the man who bought the baseball card &ndash; Dr. [[Elias Giger]] &ndash; requests a meeting with Jake and Nog after learning of their relationships to Captain Sisko and Quark. It seems he needs some supplies he believes they're in a position to obtain, and he's willing to trade the baseball card, minus the original packaging and chewing gum, for those supplies. Jake agrees, even after learning that Dr. Giger plans to use the supplies in the construction of his [[cellular regeneration and entertainment chamber]] &ndash; a device designed to keep the cells of the body from getting bored, thus prolonging life indefinitely. Jake and Nog agree that the man is crazy, but since he has the baseball card they have little choice but to acquiesce to his demands.  === Act Three === Giger provides a lengthy list, and Jake and Nog go straight to work. For a [[neodymium power cell]] from a [[Cardassian]] phase-coil inverter they visit [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]], but he's too busy re-calibrating [[EPS regulator]]s to help. Nog, always a [[Ferengi]], strikes a deal: Jake and Nog will do the work while the Chief visits a [[holosuite]] for a chance to go [[kayaking]] for the first time in weeks. In exchange, O'Brien will find the power cell.   For five liters of anaerobic metabolites suspended in a hydrosaline solution, they call on [[Doctor]] [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]], who's not only busy but is doing something he ''wants'' to do (so they can't strike a deal like they did with Chief O'Brien). However, through additional probing, Nog gets Bashir to admit that he'd be much happier if he had [[Kukalaka]] &ndash; his [[teddy bear]]. When he was still dating [[Leeta]], Bashir let her borrow Kukalaka and she never gave it back. Nog manages to retrieve the bear from Leeta while she's sleeping.  While Jake and Nog are running errands, Kai Winn discusses Weyoun's proposal with Sisko. The Dominion wants to sign a [[Nonaggression pact|nonaggression treaty]] with Bajor. She recognizes that [[Starfleet]] can't possibly protect Bajor from the full strength of the Dominion, but also knows that allying with the Dominion could make Bajor the next world conquered. Sisko advises that she stall for time and keep Bajor's options open. He tells her she needs to trust him this time. She puts her hand on his ear to read his ''[[pagh]]'', then agrees.   Meanwhile, Jake delivers a batch of Dr. Giger's requested items to his quarters. Giger then removes a chip from one of the devices just delivered, and uses it to activate a console panel on his wall, which then begins making a humming sound. The view then pans up, to the [[quarters]] above, where Weyoun is being accommodated; the sound has alerted him and his two [[Jem'Hadar]] guards that something is going on below him.  Later, Nog agreed to filter out subharmonic distortions from [[Worf]]'s [[Klingon opera]] recordings while Jake helps [[Kira Nerys|Kira]] with an upcoming speech to the [[Bajoran Agricultural Ministry]]. When they've collected the last of the supplies, however, they find that Giger and his equipment are no longer in his quarters.  === Act Four === Jake and Nog visit [[Odo]], who insists there never was such a person in those quarters. When he hears about the ""Cellular Regeneration and Entertainment Chamber,"" he reads them a list of charges including making a false report and wasting police time and scares them out of his office.  On their way out, Jake witnesses Kai Winn talking to a [[vedek]] on the upper level of the Promenade who had also bid on the lot containing the baseball card during the auction. Thinking that she was after the Bajoran mandala that was auctioned in the same lot as the baseball card, he deduces that she kidnapped Giger as a result of losing the bid.  Weyoun meets again with Kai Winn, and she tells him he'll have to wait until she's given a report to the First Minister. He says he understands, and that he and she are very much alike. She puts a hand on his ear as she did with Sisko, then says, ""''No, we are nothing alike'',"" and leaves. Shortly afterward, she is accosted in a nearby [[corridor]] by Jake and Nog.  Sisko is furious when he finds out that they have essentially accused the religious leader of Bajor of burglary and kidnapping, but Jake, still wanting to surprise his father, lies and insists that he and Nog got drunk at Quark's before approaching the Kai. Naturally, this makes Captain Sisko even angrier, and he tells them that he was wrong to place so much trust in them. He confines both of them to quarters and angrily dismisses them.  As the two argue on a [[turbolift]] after they leave Sisko's office, they're suddenly beamed onto Weyoun's ship.  === Act Five === Weyoun asks Jake and Nog about their connection to Dr. Giger. Jake explains that they were only trying to acquire a baseball card, but Weyoun doesn't believe him. He tells them that he knows about the polarized particles coming from Giger's room, that Jake and Nog have been holding secret meetings with the senior staff of the station (to acquire the requested items for Giger), and the fact that they met with Kai Winn immediately after she left him.  The [[Jem'Hadar]] bring Giger into the room, carrying the auctioned box, and revealing that it was Weyoun who had kidnapped him. Giger, seeing Jake and Nog, accuse them of betraying him to the soulless minions of orthodoxy, before he is relieved of the box. Weyoun then begins to examine its contents, telling Jake he would like them to be friends, but they must be truthful with each other.  Seeing no other option, Jake says he and Nog were working for [[Starfleet Intelligence]], and concocts an absurd story about hunting for a mysterious man from the future named Willie Mays. Weyoun realizes their original story was truthful.  Weyoun turns to Giger and asks for an explanation of his machinery. Nog dismisses Giger, quipping that he is working on a way to become immortal. Weyoun, who himself is a recipient of ""immortality,"" immediately becomes interested in Giger's work. Giger says it will take some time to explain his theories. As Giger starts to explain the chamber, Weyoun allows Jake and Nog to leave&hellip; with the baseball card.  :""''[[Captain's log]]: [[Stardate]] 50929.4. Two days ago, this station felt like a tomb. I'd never seen so many of my crew depressed at the same time. But for some reason, it now seems as though a new spirit has swept through the station &hellip; as if someone had opened a door and let a gust of fresh air blow through a musty old house.''  :""''Why this is happening is frankly a mystery to me. After all, nothing has really changed. The Dominion is still a threat, the [[Cardassian]]s are still threatening to retake the station, and I can still see the clouds of war gathering on the horizon.''  :""''So why do I sense a newfound sense of optimism in the air? But maybe I'm over thinking this. Maybe the real explanation is as simple as something [[Joseph Sisko|my father]] taught me a long time ago. Even in the darkest moments, you can always find something that'll make you smile.''""  Due to unintentional benefits of Jake's and Nog's trades, Chief O'Brien had time to go kayaking in the holosuite, Dr. Bashir has Kukalaka back (though Leeta is confused about losing him), Major Kira's speech was well received, and Worf is able to listen to his opera collection on the {{USS|Defiant|2370}}'s [[bridge]] again. Weyoun even takes an interest in Giger's work on immortality. But most importantly, Captain Sisko has a mint-condition Willie Mays rookie [[baseball]] card from [[Earth]], 1951. Sisko then gives Nog a hearty [[handshake]] and Jake a big [[hug]]. The whole station feels happier."

== Plot ==
A hot-tempered convict with a butter addiction tries to get revenge, with the help of his mentally challenged brother, on the ice cream trucker who was responsible for his arrest, unaware the driver also has a dark secret.

== Summary ==
[[Billy DeLuca]] and his brother [[Virgil DeLuca]] are planning a heist at the ice cream factory Billy currently works at. Virgil is watching cartoons as they go over the details of what will happen so they don't mess anything up. Verge gets a fact wrong about the sequence of events, which makes Billy lose his temper before Verge berates himself. Billy then tells him to get ready because he wants to eat some ice cream before 'shit goes down tomorrow'.

An ice cream truck is coming down the street driven by [[Mr. Earl Bird|Earl Byrd]], who is popular with the children. Byrd has a puppet that he shows the kids who applaud him. As the presentation is going on, Billy comes up and confronts Mr. Byrd for putting him in prison. Mr. Byrd says that Billy was stealing, and that's why he turned him in, for trimming his profits. Billy appears to make peace with Mr. Byrd in front of the children by asking for something to go. Being a butter fan, Billy asks for something in butternut, butterbrickle and buttermilk to which Mr. Byrd replies no to each one. Billy takes two butterscotch instead, and when he hands over his cash, he sees that Mr. Byrd has a large box full of money.

Back in the car, Billy gives Virgil some of his ice cream and laments about Mr. Byrd getting what is coming to him to which Virgil replies something that sets Billy off, knocking his ice cream out of his hand. Billy wants payback for the two years he spent in jail at Mr. Byrd's tattling. At the factory the next day, its CEEO Mrs. Grafungar is looking for Verge and his employees and after learning an employee went off base, she loses her temper and says that Mr. Byrd doesn't like to be kept waiting. Grafungar tells them that they could learn a thing or two from him. Grafungar thren greets Mr. Byrd out in his car and attempts to flirt with him by saying she just purchased a new pantsuit and it would look good with a date.

Byrd declines, to which she attempts to invite him to dinner for a green bean and potato chip casserole and he declines again. Grafungar gets upset, and he pays for his order. Billy and Virgil are watching Mr. Byrd counting his cash and they go over their plan again. Billy calls Virgil stupid, and he gets mad and reneges on their plan. Billy has to get Virgil back on his side so he says everyone is plotting against them. Mrs. Grafungar yells for Virgil to load up Mr. Byrd's truck, and Virgil snaps, saying he wants to hurt her. Verge confronts her in a locked room and attacks her, but she survives and crawls out of the room bleeding. Mr. Byrd is still waiting for the ice cream order to be loaded in his truck and he is growing increasingly impatient, calling for Mrs. Grafungar. Billy tries to keep her from being seen, so he grabs a hook from nearby and drags her out of sight. Mr. Byrd then drives away, and when Billy and Virgil try to go after the money in the safe, they realize it is locked up.

Virgil comes up with a plan to go after ""the puppet man"" (Mr. Byrd) for the money instead. At Mr. Byrd's house, Virgil and Billy kick the door in with guns in hands. They threaten him to give them the money, but Mr. Byrd tries to get away. Virgil shoots him in the head, knocking him over which forces the two men to have to search the house for the money instead. As they search, Billy finds a large ground freezer with money inside made to look like ice cream. He calls for Virgil, but he's not around. Suddenly a shot rings out from the opening in the next room, shooting Billy's lower leg off. [[Mr. Bird|Mr. Byrd]] comes out with a gun, surprising Billy who is now on the ground. He keeps calling for Virgil, so Mr. Byrd shows him his brother's dead body. Mr. Byrd tells Billy he thinks he and Virgil were close as brothers. He then tells Billy about his brother, whom he was close to until he died. Byrd says they are still close and tells Billy to look at what he has done.

Byrd turns around to reveal his attached twin brother Earl, who turns out to be the man Virgil shot in the head earlier, much to Billy's horror. Byrd reveals that his brother ""wasn't what you call a social butterfly"", but when he was doing Little Willie's voice, he was the best ice cream salesman and that he will miss him. An enraged Billy tells him to go to hell, to which Byrd replies 'you first' before he hits him over the head with the gun. Some hours later, Byrd is in the ice cream truck when a child comes up to tell him he smells. Byrd then turns to Earl's dead body, which is still attached to him, and they drive away.

== Summary ==
Three million years earlier on an unknown colony, a figure appears in front of [[Thomas Allman]] saying that he is unworthy of having existed, he then proceeds to erase him from history and replace him with an alternate version of him that was ""never given the gift of life"". Once complete, this figure ""deletes"" the physical form of the original version of Thomas Allman by disintegrating him with his gauntlet and then disappears.

While in ''[[Starbug]]'', after discussing the illogical of the [[wikipedia:Trojan Horse|Trojan Horse]] manoeuvrer after [[Dave Lister|Lister]] is reading the comic book version of Virgil's ''Aeneid'' (which according to [[Kryten]] has remained faithful to the original text; including many ""fzzzt!""s, ""zap!""s and ""kapow!""s). ''Starbug'' is on auto-pilot (being piloted by [[Holly]]), on a return course back to ''Red Dwarf'', then Lister's vocal chords are controlled, he is being made to speak in the figure's voice, he announces that he is the Inquisitor and that their ship is under his control, he is returning them to ''Red Dwarf'' to face judgement to justify their existence. Once released Kryten tells them on the [[astro]] folklore of the Inquisitor, a self-repairing [[simulant]] who survived to the end of time itself, who concluded that there is no god or afterlife of any kind and that the purpose of existence is to live a worthwhile life, so after constructing a time machine (in the form of a [[Time Gauntlet]]) he travels through time and space, judging each sentient lifeform, erasing those who wasted their lives and replacing them with those who never had a chance of life (the unfertilized ova, the sperm that never made it).

They return to ''[[Red Dwarf (ship)|Red Dwarf]]'' and the ""inquisition"" begins with [[Arnold Rimmer]], who is shocked to find out that the judge is himself (according to the Inquisitor, it's the only fair way to judge others). After trying to lie to himself unsuccessfully, he presents a simple case; he is nothing, but what else could he ever have been given his parents and upbringing... if anything, nothing is up. [[Cat]]'s case is a shallow one, claiming that he deserves to survive due to his ''""beautiful ass""''. Kryten honestly replies that despite his selfless nature it is not a result of a code of conduct he has decided for himself but the programming he received, and the validity of his deeds is questionable (nor does it help when Kryten asks what right the Inquisitor has to appoint himself the final judge of all sapient life). Lister is reminded that he could have gone far and has untapped potential, but blows off responsibility as he has always done and tells the Inquisitor to ""spin on it!"". The Inquisitor makes his judgement and makes Rimmer and the Cat disappear, although he is simply returning them to Red Dwarf as it is Lister and Kryten who have been judged unworthy of existence. Lister can't believe Cat led a more worthwhile existence than him; the Inquisitor explains that Rimmer and Cat are selfish, shallow and pathetic - by their own low standards, they have acquitted themselves. Lister and Kryten, on the other hand, were capable of much more. The Inquisitor erases them from time, but before deleting their physical forms, a future version of Kryten slices off the Inquisitor's hand with a [[holo-saw]] and throws them the gauntlet. After telling them of details of the ""final confrontation"", future Kryten is killed when his head is crushed against the wall.

Lister and Kryten try to move through ''Red Dwarf'' however Holly refuses to let them through a door since she doesn't recognise them and their palm prints and security codes are now useless. Turning back, they run into Rimmer, Cat and a [[Dave Lister (Alternate timeline)|new Lister]] and [[Kryten (Alternate timeline)|new Kryten]]. Lister convinces Rimmer they know each other by listing off several of Rimmer's embarrassing secrets. The gang are then ambushed by the Inquisitor as they exit [[elevators|a lift]], resulting in the deaths of these alternate counterparts. Lister and Kryten are separated from the others, and Lister helps himself to his counterpart's severed hand to enable them to get through the doors. Hiding out in ''Starbug'', Rimmer and Cat join them ready to take on the Inquisitor after the deaths of their shipmates. The four confront them, however Rimmer's [[Light Bee|light bee]] is destroyed while Cat is vaporised. Lister succeeds in freezing the Inquisitor with his gauntlet, and Kryten goes back in time to sacrifice himself, so that they get into the mess they're in, in the first place.

Lister dangles the Inquisitor over a chasm, threatening to kill him, then he saves him, reasoning that if Lister is erased, he won't be there to save him and he'll die - but the Inquisitor reasons that he can erase him quite safely as he wouldn't exist to threaten his life in the first place. It turns out that Kryten, under Lister's instructions, reprogrammed the Time Gauntlet to backfire and erase the wearer, if the ""erase"" function is used, which erases the wearer. It works, undoing all of the Inquisitor's work from the time-line, and restores Kryten, Rimmer and Cat to life. Kryten offers a high-five in which Lister decides to ""give him fifteen"" (two hands and the alternate Lister's hand, while it's still there).

1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"   == Summary == === Teaser === [[Jadzia Dax|Dax]], [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]], and [[Worf]] are in [[operations center|Ops]] discussing the trip that [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]], [[Kira Nerys|Kira]], and [[Keiko O'Brien|Keiko]] are on to the [[planet]] [[Torad V]] in the [[Gamma Quadrant]]. O'Brien frets to Worf and Dax on how he didn't want Keiko to go to Torad V in the first place ""in her condition"". Meanwhile, in [[Quark's|his bar]], [[Quark]] treats [[Rom]] to a glass of [[snail juice]] uncharacteristically on the house, to celebrate his return from [[Ferenginar]] and to announce that he is dying to all of his customers.    === Act One === Quark declares he has [[Dorek Syndrome]] with just six days to live, which he learned of after his annual [[insurance]] [[physical]] from [[Doctor]] [[Orpax]]. Rom takes some convincing that there's no other recourse, including suggesting talking to Dr. Bashir, but Quark doesn't think that will help. Quark soon turns to the significant debt he has and funeral arrangements to make. Rom suggests selling his vacuum-desiccated remains on the [[Ferengi Futures Exchange]]. Quark doesn't believe that will help, as he believes he is not viewed favorably by other Ferengi, ""Starfleet's favorite bartender,"" a joke. Rom insists he try, so Quark agrees.   Shortly afterward in [[Operations center|Ops]], the {{USS|Volga}} emerges from the [[Bajoran wormhole|wormhole]] with severe damage. Worf reports to [[Captain]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] that Dr. Bashir has reported two injuries: Kira and Keiko. O'Brien rushes to the [[infirmary]] and learns from Kira that Keiko is still in surgery. Much to his surprise, he also learns that Kira is now carrying his [[son]].  === Act Two === O'Brien is now with Sisko and Bashir, who is explaining Keiko was injured in the accident with a collision with an [[asteroid]] in the Gamma Quadrant. She was stabilized, but Bashir had to move the baby to Kira to save its life and, interestingly, that due to the short gestation period of [[Bajoran]]s, Kira must carry the baby to term. O'Brien has to process this. Later, Keiko and Kira soon recover and Kira goes to visit Keiko in her quarters, both feeling the weight of what's transpired and Keiko expressing her thanks.  Rom goes to visit Quark in his [[quarters]] to hear about the sale. At first, it seems no one but Rom wants to buy a piece of Quark, which he of course finds insulting. He starts to dismay about his life choices in opening a bar on [[Deep Space 9]], however, Quark is overjoyed to find that an anonymous bidder wants to buy all 52 discs for five hundred bars of [[latinum]]. Convinced the anonymous bidder is [[Zek|The Nagus]] and fearful that the bid will eventually be retracted, Quark accepts the bid and sells his remains. Rom congratulates him.  Quark begins to arrange paying off his debts and arranging his funeral when Bashir informs him that his doctor on Ferenginar, Orpax, had made an error and he is not going to die. Quark is excited about the prospect of suing his doctor for malpractice; the continuation of his life is just an afterthought. However, later, [[Brunt]] of the [[FCA]] arrives at his quarters and explains that he was the anonymous buyer. He condescendingly asks if Quark thought the Nagus placed the bid. The two laugh over that and agree that it would be a ridiculous idea. Quark explains that he is surprised that Brunt placed the bid and that he is not going to die. Brunt knows this already and has arrived to ensure that his merchandise, 52 discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark, will be delivered on time in six days.  === Act Three === Quark makes it clear that he is not dying, to which Brunt replies that he does not care that Quark isn't dying: he wants his merchandise. He intends to defile Quark's remains upon receiving them, and will not be talked out of the contract. Quark proceeds to offer Brunt a full refund and progressively larger amounts of latinum to try to convince Brunt to give up the deal. Brunt refuses all offers and tells Quark he will only accept his remains. When Quark asks what Brunt expects him to do, Brunt suggests Quark hire someone to strangle him &ndash; that way his body will be unmarked for desiccation. Quark is shocked and says they are not [[Klingon]]s. Brunt tells Quark that this is personal. Brunt tells Quark that he considers him a menace to [[Ferengi]] society, citing [[Family Business (episode)|the time]] he protected Quark's mother from an audit and when he [[Bar Association (episode)|secretly settled a strike]] at his bar. He loathes Quark for being a philanthropist. He doesn't gouge his customers as much as a Ferengi should. Selling medicine to Bajoran refugees has made him a generous [[humanitarian]] who has gone ""[[Starfleet]]"". All of this gives other Ferengi a bad name.   Quark begs that he can reform &ndash; that he can gouge his customers more and revoke his employee's vacation time. Brunt is disgusted by Quark's giving his employees vacation time and proceeds to start to leave the room. Quark cuts him off and tries to make another deal with him &ndash; surely there is another accommodation that Quark can make besides suicide? Brunt tells him the only way out is to break the contract. He wonders if Quark is Ferengi enough to keep the contract and hopes that he will break it. He wants to see Quark's assets sold to the lowest bidder, his mother begging on the street, and to have Quark cut off from all contact with his people. Brunt says that Quark is a disease, and that it is his job to cut him off.  Miles helps Keiko to a chair in their quarters. Keiko tells Miles that she has invited Kira over for dinner. The two agree that even seeing Kira every day would not be enough time for them to spend with their unborn child. She expresses frustration at having to make appointments to see her own child. Neither of them knows what to do.   Quark visits [[Elim Garak|Garak]]'s [[Garak's Clothiers|shop]]. He is busy helping [[Morn]] and informs Quark that his pants will not be ready for another week. Quark tells him he is there in order to hire him as an [[assassin]]. Garak feigns ignorance and says that before he was a [[tailor]] he was a [[gardener]]. Quark is not so easily dissuaded and tells him he still wants to hire him. Rom initially believes that Quark will have Brunt assassinated, but Quark reveals that ''he'' is the one that is to be killed.  === Act Four === Rom is upset about Quark's intentions to go through with the contract. Quark explains that he is like no one else in their family; he is a Ferengi businessman. He will go through with the contract. His life is about his business and that means that he follows the Ferengi [[Rules of Acquisition]], and he will not stop following them if they are inconvenient. He is confident that if he continues to follow the Rules that he will find himself in the [[Divine Treasury]] after his death. Because he will have died the way he lived: as a Ferengi. He and Garak then leave to discuss the method of his death.   Kira visits Keiko and O'Brien to show them how much the baby is kicking. Kira is concerned but Keiko tells Kira that this is good, and that she thought [[Molly O'Brien|Molly]] would kick her way of out. Keiko thanks Kira for sharing this with them. The two discuss the differences between Human and Bajoran pregnancies, and the fact that they do not know what Kira's symptoms will be because the baby is Human. Bajorans do not get morning sickness, but instead suffer from uncontrollable sneezing. Miles gets Kira a special pillow for her lower back. They invite her to remain for dinner and initially Kira does not want to impose. But Keiko insists that since Kira is carrying her baby she is now family and that besides dinner, the O'Briens also want to make a proposal.   Quark is eating dinner at the bar. Garak sneaks up behind him and breaks his [[neck]]. Quark walks over, and it becomes apparent that the dead Quark is only a hologram. Quark objects to the loud noise his neck makes when it is broken. Garak objects that it was not that loud. They are running out of options because Quark objects to all the methods that Garak has suggested (he couldn't be disintegrated because he needed his body, the disruptor ruined Quark's clothing, the knife was too savage, nerve gas smelled bad, hanging took too long, and Quark would not willingly eat [[poison]]ed food). Garak comments that Quark does not seem to want to die, to which Quark objects that he just doesn't want to see it coming. Garak promises that Quark will never know what hit him.   A jittery Quark heads to bed while trying to stave off death by yelling he won't be surprised before he enters his room. He quickly falls asleep and awakes in what looks like the Divine Treasury.  === Act Five === The first [[Grand Nagus]], [[Gint]] (who looks suspiciously similar to Quark's brother Rom), comes to him and Quark realizes that he is dreaming. The Nagus (or at least Quark's conscience) tells Quark that he must break the contract. Quark asks how he can walk away from the Rules. To this, Gint explains that when he authored the Rules of Acquisition, he called them such as a marketing ploy, and considers them more like ""suggestions"". Gint explains that Quark is having this dream because he is looking for permission to break the contract. Quark realizes if Gint came to him in a dream and told him to break the contract, then it would be acceptable. Brunt then appears, and the three of them argue until Brunt begins strangling Quark, who wakes up in his sleep with his own hands around his throat.  The next day, Quark walks into his bar and refuses to honor the contract. Brunt, sitting at a table, smiles as Quark has proved himself to be just another failure in a long line of weak-lobed Ferengi. However, Quark threatens that if he ever returns to his bar, he will never leave. Brunt immediately revokes Quark's [[business license]], and slaps legal documents on the walls preventing any Ferengi business to continue and seizes all of his assets. Quark is left with no other choice but to close the bar immediately and indefinitely, and is forced to ask his customers to leave.   Kira arrives at the O'Briens' quarters where she has agreed to live for the duration of the pregnancy. Kira tells Molly that she is her aunt Kira and that Molly is welcome to play in her room anytime.   Quark sits in a bare area at the bar near where the [[dabo table]] used to be, having been left with nothing, not even the shirt on his back which needs to be returned later to Brunt. Rom tries to cheer him up by offering Quark some of his old clothes, but to no avail. However, Bashir enters with a crate of [[Alvanian brandy]], claiming that a patient gave them to him as a gift, and, as he cannot accept them, he is willing to give them to Quark. Then Dax arrives with a dozen glasses she was given as a gift by [[Jadzia's sister 001|her sister]] that she claims are too ugly to keep.   Captain Sisko arrives and asks Quark if he can store several sets of tables and chairs from structural repair on level 2 of the habitat ring in the area, since it's currently free. Quark can scarcely believe what is happening, as the crew and residents start bringing in everything he needs to continue running the bar. Rom reminds his brother that Brunt didn't take ''all'' of his assets away, as Quark has apparently earned the loyalty and respect of many aboard the station. Despite being broke, Quark is left to ponder the thought that ''friends'' may be the most valuable asset of all. Overwhelmed by his friends showing their support, he attempts to thank them, but is literally speechless. "

[[Commander]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] is in his [[dress uniform]] preparing to welcome the [[Wadi ship|ship]], although he gets worried when he learns that [[Jake Sisko|Jake]] has been learning about [[Bajoran]] girls from none other than his new friend [[Nog]]. Sisko decides they need to set aside some time the next day so he can work 'damage control'.  The [[senior staff]] assemble in the [[airlock]] to greet the Wadi representative, [[Falow]]. Although Sisko is keen to make a good impression, he is put out to find that Falow and the other Wadi just want to head straight to [[Quark's]] in order to play games.  === Act One === In Quark's Bar, the Wadi delegates are eager to play a new game. However, [[Quark]] has to make sure they have something to gamble with for [[dabo]]. Falow offers ''[[klon peag]]s'' or [[alpha-currant nectar]] as items of value, but Quark refuses them. Then, he proffers a bag of gems, which Quark accepts greedily.  After about six hours, the delegates are winning almost every spin and both Quark and Commander Sisko are getting tired (in Quark's case, he is tired of them always winning). Sisko decides enough is enough and leaves the bar to go to bed. Before leaving, Sisko asks Quark to inform him when they stop playing dabo. Quark heads over to the table and pleads that the Dabo girl's hands are tired from all of those spins. Falow orders Quark to replace her. Quark gets [[Broik]] to replace her and instructs him covertly to begin fixing the table so that the Wadi do not win. He loses the next turn and becomes suspicious. He soon discovers Quark's deception and corners him at the bar. Quark tries to pass it off like he didn't know, but Falow is not fooled. He decides to start a new game and transforms the dabo table to a different board game, which he announces is called ''[[chula]]''. He explains that the game involves four {{dis|player|game}}s, and that their objective is to ""move along home"". Quark decides to play the game, in hope that the Wadi will be lenient with his cheating.  In Sisko's quarters, he finds Jake still awake late into the evening. Jake admits to his father that he has been spending time with Nog, but on a school project, nothing more. Sisko tells him to go to bed, saying that is no excuse, and promises to have a chat with him about Nog and girls in the morning. However, as he is sleeping, he tosses and wakes up to find himself lying on the floor of a large, odd room.   === Act Two === He tries to call Ops and attempts to end the program, if he is in a holosuite, but no luck. He has his [[Starfleet tricorder]] with him, so he searches around, trying all the doors until he finds an unlocked one. Sisko wanders a hall, opening another door. Behind it, he encounters an image of Falow, who, laughing mockingly, instructs him to ""''Move along, move along home!''""  Hearing faint cries for help, he finds [[Doctor]] [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]], who believes this is a dream and is trying to wake himself up. [[Major]] [[Kira Nerys|Kira]] and [[Lieutenant]] [[Jadzia Dax|Dax]] show up moments later, also drawn by Bashir's screams. Sisko tells them of his encounter with Falow, which Bashir believes is a behavioral test, which deeply upsets Kira. They decide to split up and use their comm badges, which are still working, to keep in touch.  Early next morning, Jake Sisko informs [[Odo]] that his father is missing. Odo discovers that Sisko and three other senior staff members are not on board the station and launches an investigation. After scolding Lieutenant [[George Primmin|Primmin]], who had assumed they were affected by the long party last night, Odo orders a full security sweep of the station and the docked ships.  Meanwhile, Falow keeps Quark in the game, forcing him to learn the rules as he plays. Quark nervously asks for a minimum wager and rolls. Falow goes to work, executing the next turn. Meanwhile, the four players reach a door, which opens to reveal a girl playing a hopscotch-like game, and singing a rhyme:  :''""Allamaraine, count to four,'' :''Allamaraine, then three more,'' :''Allamaraine, if you can see,'' :''Allamaraine, you'll come with me&hellip;""''  The players move into the room, and are sealed in. Moving across the room, Kira stumbles into a [[force field]]. The girl, however, moves through it. Bashir deduces that the pattern of the girl's movements allows her to pass though, but is also knocked backwards. Jadzia follows the girl precisely, both singing the rhyme and mimicking the hand actions, and successfully passes the force field. The others follow. The girl proclaims:  :''""Allamaraine! Third [[shap]].""''  Back on the station, the Wadi cheer ""Allamaraine!"", as Falow moves the four pieces down one level on the board and hands Quark several jewels. He happily accepts them and believes he is learning the game.  === Act Three === Falow asks Quark to choose a path for the players, either the difficult short route, with a chance of winning more prizes, or the long, easy route. He says to choose carefully. ""''Double their peril, double your winnings!''"" teases Falow. Quark excitedly tries to negotiate a licensing agreement to keep the game in his bar, when Odo barges in demanding to know if Quark has seen them. He brushes him off until Odo exclaims four officers are missing. Slowly, Quark makes the connection &ndash; four players, four missing officers. He nervously looks at the player pieces and then at Odo, who silently understands Quarks realization. Falow insists he choose, so he chooses the safer path and, with Odo watching, rolls the dice.   Moving through the corridors of the maze, the players find a room with Wadi in it, all drinking and laughing. They don't very well respond to the officers. Frustrated, Kira starts shouting and throwing a tray of food to the floor. Suddenly the doors close, and a [[toxic]] [[gas]] fills the room, causing the players to start coughing. Furthermore, Falow comes into the room, telling them to move home again, but otherwise not responding. Bashir notices that the Wadi remain unaffected and decides to try some of the drink that is being offered around. The drink relieves the effects of the gas. Sisko and the others also drink, and are also relieved. The Wadi all cheer. The image of Falow states that the players have progressed to shap four. At the table, the Wadi cheer ""[[allamaraine]]"" and Falow moves the player pieces ahead and Quark is happy to win more. Odo, concerned, leaves.  === Act Four ===  After some strange readings are detected on the Wadi's ship, Odo decides to visit the Wadi ship over Primmin's Starfleet objections. Odo retorts that he is not in Starfleet, and he orders him to [[beam]] him over and finds a room with an unusual energy signature. Stepping through the doors, he surprisingly ends up in Quark's Bar, to find Quark playing the game. Falow notices him, and reminds Quark to continue playing, choosing the next path. He chooses the safer path, but Falow says it's an ""unfortunate roll.""  In the game, they continue to move through the corridors when their tricorders detect an energy buildup. A bright light source appears and moves towards them. At the table, Falow selects a player piece. The light source scans them all, and then focuses on Bashir, who vanishes. Falow knocks over the piece, suggesting the player is out. Odo immediately orders them to give the officers back, but Falow ignores it, insisting they keep playing. However, he says Odo can have them back when Quark is done, albeit cryptically. Falow then tells Quark to choose which route to take, and he considers the risky path. Odo cautions Quark, but Quark realizes that the players were only one level away from ""home"", and the short route would take them there in only one move. Quark reassures Odo that he has spent his life assessing chance in games of all kinds, and that he has a good understanding of this one. With Odo's agreement, Quark decides to take the short route, but rolls a [[thialo]] &ndash; he must sacrifice one, so that two may live.  === Act Five ===  Odo is dismayed, and so is Quark, who is unable to decide which player to sacrifice. Odo says he cannot be forced to choose, but Falow says all three will be lost if he doesn't. He grovels dramatically and pleads to be allowed not to decide, and Falow accepts. He programs the computer to randomly select a player to be sacrificed.  In the game, they hear Bashir calling out. A door opens, and Dax heads into it. The others follow. They find themselves in a rocky cavern. In the distance, they can hear Bashir's voice calling to them, which entices them forward. Dax stumbles on loose rocks, and a large boulder lands on her leg. Fortunately, the leg is not broken, and they continue onwards. They see Bashir's figure, but instead of coming to help Dax, Falow's figure again appears and tells them they are on shape six. Dax eventually exhorts Kira and Sisko to leave her and reach safety, but they refuse, and insist on attempting to help Dax. Moving round a narrow outcropping on a steep cliff, they all fall off, appearing suddenly back in the bar, together with Bashir.   The Wadi finish their game and change the table back to a dabo table, and are about to leave, when Commander Sisko demands to know what was going on. At that point, Falow's normally stern demeanor changes. He states, with a comical intonation, ""It's only a game!"" There never was any actual risk, and that Quark had cheated them in Dabo. Having just feared for their lives, Commander Sisko is miffed at the Wadi; the Wadi have committed a [[wiktionary:faux pas|faux pas]] on the group by offering them a game that deceived them into thinking that they were playing for their lives, which understandably would annoy the players especially after finding out that their lives were not in danger all this time. After the Wadi leave, Quark chases after Falow, sensing an opportunity to market Chula.   "

Until the disturbance ends, we'll be forced to maintain the station with a [[skeleton crew]].""''  The crew of Deep Space 9 evacuates to avoid an impending [[plasma storm]], leaving a [[skeleton crew]]. [[Jadzia Dax]] has the {{USS|Orinoco}} ready at [[Landing pad|Landing Pad]] C in case of emergencies. [[Miles O'Brien]] and [[Odo]] are checking the station and are at the docking ring. A loud banging reveals [[Quark]] hiding in one of the [[airlock]]s. He goes back to [[Quark's Bar, Grill, Gaming House and Holosuite Arcade|his bar]], but they don't see a device on the wall beeping as they leave.  === Act One === While monitoring the storm and securing the station, the crew receives a [[distress call]] claiming to be from a [[cargo ship]] called ''[[Ekina]]''. O'Brien and Odo go down to meet them, but the crew is hostile. A timid [[Trill]] named [[Verad]] and his crew (a pair of [[Klingon]] [[mercenary|mercenaries]], [[T'Kar]] and [[Yeto]], and former [[prostitute]] [[Mareel]]) surprise them. T'Kar directs the takeover, forcing Odo into a locked box, and capturing O'Brien and Dr. [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]], but not before forcing Bashir to put the box in stasis in the [[infirmary]]. The group then goes to [[operations center|Ops]] and captures the rest of the crew. In the corner, O'Brien realizes Quark probably had a hand in them getting around the security measures and notes this to [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]].  Yeto goes to Quark's bar and makes it clear he is not going according to the plan Quark understood (a business transaction), and brings him to Ops under guard. There, Verad, again timidly, states he wants the {{dis|Dax|symbiont}} [[Trill symbiont|symbiont]].  === Act Two === Verad explains he is bitter because he applied to be ""joined"" and was rejected after a lifetime of preparation and sacrifice when the [[Symbiosis Evaluation Board]] declared him unsuitable for joining. He targeted the Dax symbiont specifically, as it is the most compatible for him, and furthermore plans to escape to the [[Gamma Quadrant]] to start a new life. Bashir attempts to refuse to perform the procedure, but Verad shoots O'Brien at his right shoulder, making it clear he will hurt everyone there if he does not get what he wants. He allows Bashir to tend to O'Brien briefly, and Jadzia submits in order to prevent further harm, even though she knows removing the symbiont will kill her within a few hours. Yeto then escorts them to the infirmary, leaving Mareel and T'Kar.    Verad forces Bashir to transfer the symbiont into his body while he's awake, using a neuro-electrical suppressor, and demands a monitor to watch the procedure. Bashir reluctantly puts Jadzia to sleep, asking for forgiveness. Yeto watches as Bashir performs the operation successfully, asking forgiveness from Jadzia.  In Ops, the crew waits and has a quiet conversation. Demanding silence, T'Kar starts a scuffle and O'Brien is attacked. Mareel subdues [[Kira Nerys|Kira]] and gets the upper hand with a phaser. Later, Kira gets Mareel to talk. She informs them she knew Verad a long time ago back when he was a [[communications clerk]] at the [[Embassy|Federation Consulate]] on [[Khefka IV]] and he helped her out of a bad situation, and that she loves him. She doesn't believe Sisko's point that a joined Trill becomes an entirely different person than before, and that she will lose him.  At that point, Verad Dax appears, completely calm and confident.  === Act Three === Bashir has Yeto act as a [[nurse]] as he tries to save Jadzia's life. Yeto resists, trying to get a rise out of Bashir, but does eventually help him. She wakes up feeling very alone. He promises to save her, and tells her to rest.  Meanwhile, Sisko tries to coax his old friend (Verad now has the memories of both Jadzia and [[Curzon Dax]]) into setting things right, first by recalling memories going back to when they first met at [[Pelios Station]], but eventually mentioning discovering the [[Bajoran wormhole]], one of Jadzia's memories. This gives him pause, but he says it's too late, that the integration is already happening and the symbiont is too weak to undergo the procedure again. He then justifies it by saying he wants to benefit many worlds in the Gamma Quadrant with his knowledge and experience, including Jadzia's memories. Mareel questions why Verad is entertaining the conversation at all and gets a snap retort from Verad &ndash; she begins to realize how much he has changed, but continues to remain loyal to him.   Sisko realizes Verad intends to let Jadzia die, and ends their friendship abruptly. This affects Verad.  === Act Four === Verad's group waits the storm for safe passage to the wormhole. Meanwhile, Mareel attempts to give O'Brien a [[Senarian egg broth]] to help him with his strength, which he reluctantly accepts. Mareel looks up to Verad, who is thinking alone in Sisko's office, and Sisko again tries to convince her he's changed more than she realizes. She stays loyal, but the talk gets heated. Seeing this, Verad comes out from Sisko's office, but she assures him everything is fine. Just then, Quark attacks T'Kar, and pretends to be injured so he is taken to the infirmary. Verad orders Mareel to take him down. There, Quark squeals and signals to Bashir to ""run some further tests."" Mareel leaves Yeto alone with him and Bashir, giving the two their opportunity. Bashir knocks him out with a [[hypospray]], then removes the container Odo is in from the medical bay's stasis field. Bashir does not see how the container can be opened without the access code, but Quark identifies its [[Delgorian locking mechanism]], which he manages to crack using his superior hearing and a bit of impromptu ""surgery"" with one of Bashir's [[laser scalpel]]s.  Mareel goes to Verad and they plan their escape. Verad wants to ensure she is safe, however, when Mareel mentions them being together, he is reluctant to reciprocate. Now, Mareel is doubtful.  Once Verad realizes Yeto is subdued, he guesses that Odo is free and immediately heads for his ship with T'Kar. He takes Kira as a [[hostage]] just in case. Mareel wishes him luck, staying behind in Ops. Verad bids Sisko farewell, wishing they could stay friends, but Sisko promises him they'll be seeing each other again. This stuns Verad a bit, but he leaves.  === Act Five === Sisko goes to Mareel again, asking about the rendezvous since he knows it will never happen. She's now convinced Verad lied to her about the rendezvous, which he has never done, and finally accepts that the ""new"" Verad is no longer the man she loves.  Sisko promises that he will save both Verad and Jadzia by removing the symbiont from one and replacing it in the other. Mareel relents and surrenders her [[phaser]] and [[combadge]], but promises to kill Sisko if Verad is not brought back alive. He believes her.   By the time Verad reaches his ship, Odo has released the [[docking clamp]]s, leaving him stranded. Verad runs when he sees Odo, leaving T'Kar to be overpowered by both Odo and Kira. Verad heads for a different [[runabout]] in a neighboring airlock, but runs into Sisko and the two have a stand off. Believing that Sisko will not shoot his old friend in fear of harming the symbiont, Verad begins to walk away, but Sisko shoots him with his phaser anyway, declaring, ''""Don't call me Benjamin.""''   Fortunately, Bashir successfully reverses the symbiont's host, and Verad wakes up without it. He is very shaken up, despite Mareel's devotion and her promise that she will never leave his side. Meanwhile, Jadzia wakes up on the next table and gratefully embraces Sisko. She confides that the symbiont's brief contact with Verad has given her his memories - ''""and it's all so sad"". ''Even though the procedure has been reversed, Verad is now part of the Dax symbiont forever.   "
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0," ==Summary== ===Teaser=== It is a hectic day in [[Quark's|the bar]], as [[Quark]] is grousing about the backup in his drink orders because of a [[drink replicator]] malfunction. He says his maintenance request has been put off by an overworked [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]], who had promised to send [[Rom]] who in turn promised to send [[Nog]]. As Quark complains, [[Jadzia Dax]] arrives offering to repair his replicator, explaining that Nog was given the chance to go to [[Ferenginar]] and she is doing this to repay a favor to him. Quark insists that such a job is ""beneath"" her, and [[Odo]], listening, wryly observes that the [[Ferengi]] has some tender feelings for the [[Trill]] and teases that it must irritate him that she's married. Quark tells Odo that that is the most ridiculous thing he has said this past year and tells him to leave since he is not ordering anything. After Odo leaves, Quark stares longingly at Dax while her back is turned to him.  Meanwhile, [[Nog]] and [[Jake Sisko|Jake]] are departing [[Starbase 257]] in the [[Danube class|runabout]] {{USS|Shenandoah}}, to travel to [[Ferenginar]] to deliver an official message from the [[Federation Council]] to [[Grand Nagus]] [[Zek]]. Even if Nog won't say anything about its contents, Jake suspects it is about something big, maybe even an [[alliance]]. Nog is put out when he discovers that Jake told the editor of the [[Federation News Service]] that he could get an exclusive interview with Zek despite promising he wasn't coming on the trip as a [[reporter]] and tells Jake that he won't even be getting anywhere near the Grand Nagus. Their discussion is cut short when they encounter a wing of six [[Jem'Hadar fighter]]s on their way to attack the base. Even though they weren't the original objective, one fighter breaks formation and comes after them.  ===Act One===  Nog makes an emergency warp jump, despite Jake's warnings that their course is taking them further into [[Cardassian]] territory. When Nog drops to [[impulse]] speed to engage the Jem'Hadar ship in real space, the runabout takes a heavy beating from its weapons, but then they are miraculously saved by the arrival of another ship they first believe to be the {{USS|Defiant|2370}}, but which turns out to be a different {{class|Defiant}} ship, the {{USS|Valiant|NCC-74210}}.  While the ship engages the enemy fighter, the two friends are beamed aboard and are surprised to be greeted by ""[[Acting]] [[Chief Petty Officer]]"" [[Dorian Collins]] &ndash; a young woman in a [[cadet]] uniform but wearing a chief's [[rank insignia]]. Escorted to the [[bridge]], they see that the entire crew is composed of cadets. Nog recognizes them as [[Red Squad]], the elite cadet cadre within [[Starfleet Academy]] that he so fervently wanted to join [[Homefront (episode)|two years]] [[Paradise Lost (episode)|earlier]]. After the fighter is taken out, they meet ""[[Captain]]"" [[Tim Watters]], the ship's [[commanding officer|CO]], who explains that he was given a [[battlefield commission]] by the previous captain, {{dis|Ramirez|24th century}}, and he has used that authority to promote other cadets as needed to fill vacant positions. Watters orders Chief Collins to take Jake to [[sickbay]] to see to some minor burns he has suffered. When the ship's [[first officer]], ""[[Commander]]"" [[Karen Farris]], reports that the [[warp drive]] is still functioning below warp 3.2, Nog volunteers a suggestion, and Watters is happy to accept the advice of a trained [[engineer]].  With Jake in sickbay and Nog in Captain Watters's [[ready room]], Chief Collins and Watters explain their unique situation to Jake while treating him in the ship's sickbay; the ''Valiant'' departed on a [[shakedown cruise]] eight months ago, crewed by seven regular [[officer]]s and thirty-five cadets, on a three-month training mission to circumnavigate the entire [[Federation]] before returning home. Although such cruises are standard for senior cadets, Jake notes that it is unusual for them to be entrusted with a state-of-the-art [[warship]], or for such a large group of cadets to be given a mission of such complexity. Collins proudly explains that they are Red Squad and considered anything but usual. In the ''Valiant''{{'}}s ready room, Watters explains that the ship was transitioning through the [[Kepla sector]] when the [[Dominion War|war]] broke out and a Dominion invasion force swept through the sector on the first day, so they were caught behind enemy lines. They tried to make it back to [[Federation space]] when they encountered a [[Cardassian]] [[Cardassian battle cruiser 001|battle cruiser]] near [[El-Gatark]], and in the ensuing battle, both ships lost main power becoming adrift and all the ''Valiant''{{'}}s [[senior officer]]s were killed or critically wounded, including Captain Ramirez. Despite having a [[puncture]]d [[lung]] and massive internal injuries, Ramirez refused to go to sickbay and instead, stayed on the bridge to direct the entire damage control effort and the cadets were able to get the ''Valiant''{{'}}s systems back online in three hours and destroy the Cardassian ship. Just before he died the next day, Ramirez gave Watters command of the ship.   Nog is awestruck at the tale and how Red Squad has spent eight months behind enemy lines, and Watters offers him a post as [[chief engineering officer]]. Nog is a little hesitant to take on such a responsibility, but Watters tells him that the undermanned ship needs him. Nog accepts and is given a Red Squad pin for his collar. Watters then explain that with Nog's help, they can fix their warp drive problems and get on with their mission: when the war broke out, [[Starfleet Command]] (unaware that command of the ship had passed to a cadet) transmitted new orders to the ''Valiant'' to collect technical data on a new [[Jem'Hadar battleship|Dominion battleship]] being deployed in their sector. Since they were ordered to maintain [[radio silence]], the ship had been cut off from the rest of [[Starfleet]] since the outbreak of the war. Undaunted, the young captain is determined to carry on the ''Valiant''{{'}}s mission or die trying.  ===Act Two=== Chief Collins takes Jake to the [[mess hall]], where he draws more than a few stares from the rest of the thirty three-man crew (being the only [[civilian]] on board). They converse amiably, and Collins starts to tell him about her home of [[Tycho City]] on [[Luna]]. As she remembers growing up on Luna, she starts to get emotional and excuses herself saying she's on duty.  In [[engineering]], Nog makes some modifications that Farris objects are unsafe, but Watters is willing to try anything, and the ship succeeds in getting to warp 4.  Collins is in sickbay looking at a [[PADD]] and [[crying]] a little when Watters comes in and, despite Collins's disapproval, grabs some pills from a cabinet and swallows them. He notices she's been crying, and she admits that she has been feeling a little [[Homesickness|homesick]].  The next thing Jake knows, he has been summoned to the ready room for an ""interrogation"" by Watters and Farris. They remind him of the extreme urgency of their mission and say that his presence is upsetting the delicate morale of their shipmates. They dismiss Jake, and Watters tells Farris to keep a close eye on him. Before she is dismissed, Farris remarks that Watters spent another double shift on the bridge, and she is concerned that he is not getting enough sleep. Watters assures her that he is fine &ndash; before swallowing another handful of pills after she has left.  ===Act Three===  Still smarting, Jake runs into Nog, and is surprised to see that he has now joined the crew, with a brevet rank of [[lieutenant commander]]. Nog is stung when Jake echoes his own earlier doubts about whether he is ready to be chief engineer of a starship. Before they can argue further, [[red alert]] is sounded and all hands are ordered to report to [[battle stations]]. Jake and Nog run to the bridge.  The ''Valiant'' has located the objective of its mission. While hovering outside its sensor range, the ship launches a [[class 3 probe]] to gather the intelligence needed and shadows the ship for several hours. Between an overzealous crew and an almost inhuman dynamic, the mission finally comes to a successful end.   :""''[[Captain's log]], [[Stardate]] 51825.4. We've been shadowing the Dominion battleship for three hours. The data our probe has gathered so far has not only been interesting, but it may have given us a golden opportunity to strike a blow for the Federation.''""  In the mess hall, Watters announces that their mission is a success: they have gathered the required intelligence without being detected, and they are now free to return home to Federation space. But he says that the Jem'Hadar battleship is a direct threat to every Federation outpost and colony within fifty light years and that it must be destroyed, and it can. Farris then explains that their scans indicate a major design flaw in the battleship &ndash; the primary support braces of its [[antimatter storage system]] is composed of [[viterium]] which is ordinarily resilient but becomes extremely unstable when exposed to [[delta radiation]]. A direct hit with a specially modified [[quantum torpedo]] should be able to cause the entire antimatter storage system to tear itself apart and destroy the entire ship. Nog immediately sees a problem: the modified torpedo will need to have its [[guidance system]] all but removed, which means the ''Valiant'' will need to fire at extremely close range &ndash; approximately three hundred meters and remain there while the torpedo is guided in manually. Captain Watters says it may be dangerous, but it is better that they take the risk than have ""some other ship, with some other crew"" be asked to take it later and that he thinks they can do it, and they should do it.   This gets the crew excited, but Jake, having had enough speaks out and attempts to appeal to the common sense of the crew and convince them to leave the area with the new information. He explains that [[Benjamin Sisko|his father]] has a well-deserved reputation as one of the best combat officers in [[Starfleet|the fleet]] and not even he would attempt this mission with a single ship (even were that ship the ''Defiant'' with a full crew complement of his veteran officers). And if he can't do it, it can't be done. Watters dismisses his objections, deciding that the reward outweighs the risk and that they are Red Squad, and they can do ''anything''. The crew begin cheering and start chanting ""Red Squad"", including Nog, which shocks Jake.  ===Act Four=== Alone in engineering, Jake tries to talk some sense into Nog while he is modifying the torpedo. The Jem'Hadar battleship they are going up against is twice as large as a {{class|Galaxy}} starship, with three times the armament, yet Watters wants to try and combat it with a single [[escort vessel]]. Nog says that the captain knows what he's doing, something Jake would understand if he was an officer and not just a reporter. Angrily, Jake tells Nog about Watters' addiction to [[cordafin]] [[stimulant]]s, which he learned from talking with Collins despite being ordered to stay away from her, but Nog refuses to listen. Jake says that Watters is going to get them all killed, and Nog orders Jake, ""get out!""  Unknown to Jake and Nog, Watters happened to be monitoring their conversation from his ready room, and summons help right as Jake said that Collins told him of Watters' drug-taking. As soon as Jake leaves engineering, he is apprehended by Cadet [[Riley Aldrin Shepard|Shepard]] and another cadet with [[Type 2 phaser|phaser]]s and thrown in the [[brig]].  The ''Valiant'' prepares for its mission: the sickbay crew is drilled, and Collins issues [[Type 3 phaser|phaser rifle]]s to the security teams in case they have to repel boarders (or perhaps even board the vessel themselves). Watters addresses all hands with an inspirational speech, reminding them to keep their minds on their duty. The ship accelerates to warp 6.  ===Act Five=== When the Jem'Hadar warship spots the ''Valiant'', it drops out of warp and turns to face them. There is a moment of nervousness, as the bridge crew starts to fully appreciate what they are up against. Watters remains undaunted and orders the helm to take the ship on a [[Pattern Suicide|head-to-head]] attack run at close range to avoid its weapons. The Jem'Hadar open fire, and ''Valiant'' begins to take damage.  The torpedoes are launched, and Farris guides them to the battleship's perceived weak spot. The [[torpedo]]es score a direct hit, and the bridge crew cheers as there is an explosion of flame, and the battleship begins to flounder&hellip; before emerging intact from the fireball. Watters asks if they missed the target, and Farris confirms they scored a direct hit &ndash; except their tactic simply ''""didn't work.""'' As the reality of their situation becomes clear, the normally arrogant and overzealous Red Squad is replaced by a group of very frightened youths, trapped deep in enemy space and massively outgunned at close range by an invulnerable enemy ship five times the size of their escort.   The battleship begins hammering the ''Valiant'' with its own torpedoes. Watters starts to order [[evasive maneuvers]] when a console explodes, ripping the [[captain's chair]] off its support and killing him. The ''Valiant'' loses [[main power]], [[propulsion]], [[weapon]]s, and [[shields]]. Farris starts to repeat the evasion order, before more explosions kill her and the rest of the bridge crew, except Nog and Collins. Collins asks Nog for orders since he is now ranking officer, saying their [[phaser bank]]s are still partially functional, but after a moment's pause, Nog knows the battle's outcome is now a foregone conclusion. After he triggers the [[evacuation alert]], Nog grabs Collins' hand and leads her off the bridge.  In the brig, most of the security crew has been killed when Nog and Collins run down to free Jake from the holding cell. Together, they make their way to the [[escape pod]]s.  Only four pods are launched from the ''Valiant''; two are destroyed by the battleship, and one is caught in an explosion as the ''Valiant'' is destroyed. The listing, rupturing hull of the ''Valiant'' hides from the battleship's view the one pod that gets away, carrying Nog, Jake, and Collins.  In a nearby sector of space, the ''Defiant'' is searching for Nog and Jake's missing [[runabout]], when [[Major]] [[Kira Nerys|Kira]] picks up the pod's [[distress signal]], identifying it with the ''Valiant''. [[Worf]] warns that the ''Valiant'' officially went missing eight months ago, and it may be a [[Dominion]] [[trap]]. But [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] says the signal may be legitimate and therefore, they have to check it out anyway.  The pod is rescued, though Sisko grimly informs Jake that no others were found in the area. They enter sickbay where [[Dr.]] [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]] treats Collins and Nog's injuries, and Jake goes to comfort a somber Nog. He asks Jake if he plans to write a story about the incident, and Jake says he probably will. Nog then asks Jake about what he is going to say, to which Jake asks what he should say. Nog tells Jake to say that the ''Valiant'' was a good ship, with a good crew, whose only mistake was blindly following Captain Watters as he led them ""over a cliff."" From her sickbed, Collins objects, saying that Watters was a great man. Jake reminds Collins that Watters got everyone killed, but Collins insists that if Watters failed the mission, it was because the crew that ultimately failed him. Nog then tells Jake to include both opinions in the story, and let people decide for themselves. Nog then gently taking Collins' hands in his own and giving her his Red Squad [[insignia]] pin, declares to Collins that while Watters might very well have been a hero and even a great man, he was a bad captain in the end."
1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0," ==Summary== ===Teaser=== [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]], [[Odo]], and [[Quark]] are in the station commander's office debating the disposition of 27 [[Cardassian vole]]s which Sisko claims are intended for [[Vole fighting|fighting]]. Apparently Quark and [[Morn]] were discovered painting numbers on the voles' backs in Quark's [[storeroom]], even though Quark claims that they were Morn's pets. Sisko orders that the voles be [[confiscate]]d, suggesting that if Morn wants new pets, he can get some [[goldfish]] instead. Quark says ""''Poor Morn. This is gonna break his [[heart]]s.''""  Sisko then walks out into [[Operations center|Ops]], where he tells an unnamed lieutenant ""Ops is yours"" and walks toward the [[turbolift]] landing… just as the car arrives carrying {{mu|Miles O'Brien|O'Brien}}, who is out of uniform, which surprises Sisko, who asks if O'Brien is going somewhere. As O'Brien steps off the turbolift, he tells Sisko that he needs to converse privately, then after Odo leaves with Quark draws a [[phaser]]. However, Sisko immediately orders the Ops crew to stand down.  After ordering Sisko onto the [[transporter]] pad, O'Brien waves a [[multidimensional transporter device|multidimensional transporter]] over the normal transporter controls, after which O'Brien and Sisko transport to a [[Terran raider|raider]] and Sisko asks where they are. ''""I guess you could say we just stepped through the looking glass,""'' O'Brien says in reply.  ===Act One=== O'Brien leads Sisko into another compartment, and, in a quick moment, Sisko disarms him. At barrel's end, O'Brien confirms that they are in the [[mirror universe]]. Since [[Crossover (episode)|the time last year]] Kira and Bashir crossed over, the {{mu|Terran}}s have started a [[Terran Rebellion|rebellion]] against the [[Klingon-Cardassian Alliance]], and the rebellion at issue was led by {{mu|Benjamin Sisko|Sisko’s counterpart}}… until he was killed when the ship he was on was destroyed by the Alliance. Sisko demands to be taken back to his own universe, as he can't further influence events there. O'Brien then encourages him, explaining that, in his universe, {{mu|Jennifer Sisko}} is very much alive, working for the Alliance on a trans-spectral sensor array that will enable the Alliance to root the rebellion out of their bases in the [[Badlands]]. In closing, O'Brien explains that if Sisko will not retrieve her from {{mu|Terok Nor}}, the rebels will be left with ""no choice but to kill her."" Sisko concedes than he cannot bear the death of a [[Jennifer Sisko|second Jennifer Sisko]], and agrees to attempt her rescue.  On Terok Nor, Jennifer Sisko arrives at [[Intendant]] {{mu|Kira Nerys|Kira}}'s [[crew quarters|quarters]], clearly not enthusiastic about talking to her. The Intendant informs Jennifer that her husband has been killed, but she is not fazed, as they did not part on good terms. Back on the raider, O'Brien &ndash; or rather ""Smiley,"" as he's reminded Sisko to address him &ndash; explains that Jennifer despises her late husband, who was much better at fighting than leading. Finally the two of them transport to a rebel base, where a new mission is under discussion. It appears {{mu|Julian Bashir|Bashir}} is ready to take charge of their force, and wants to simply smuggle explosives on the station and detonate them, no matter the risk. Just then, Sisko and Smiley enter. As Bashir looks on Sisko with a gimlet eye, {{mu|Tuvok}} points out that they all thought Captain Sisko dead. Sisko attributes it to propaganda. He successfully wins over the group with his confidence, but then {{mu|Jadzia Dax|Jadzia}} saunters in to give Sisko a kiss of gratitude, a slap across the face for letting her think that he was dead, and a question: ''""are you coming or not?""'' Sisko hangs back so that Smiley can explain to him that Jadzia is Sisko's {{dis|mistress|lover}}. Jadzia seduces a reluctant Sisko, who returns her advances.  ===Act Two=== On Terok Nor, the Intendant is dismayed by the decreased productivity on the station. Garak insists he's doing all he can, but she takes him down to the processing center and orders gratuitous executions of Terran [[Slavery|slaves]] as an incentive. {{mu|Elim Garak|Garak}} suggests that she's been in a foul humor… ever since Captain Sisko was killed. The Intendant denies it, but she is clearly frustrated and Garak knows it.  As the rebels are restless about the impending completion of the sensor array, a suspicious Jadzia is telling Sisko that she is tired of fighting the Alliance, after not seeing progress for a year. She's tired of living on the run, and says they ought to just abandon the rebellion, as their group of ex-slaves with delusions of grandeur are not capable of winning. Sisko says he's not ready to give up just yet, and they must make sure Jennifer Sisko does not complete the sensor array.   Later, with the whole group, Sisko insists (over Bashir's objections) that Jennifer's rescue, not her death, is their next objective. Bashir continues to argue, and, quietly during, O'Brien suggests to Sisko that he hit him, as the other Sisko would. He quickly goes over and hits him just as he starts talking about his wife. He berates him for doing so, though Bashir and Dax remind him it would be much easier to kill her than to convince her to leave. O'Brien reminds them that they need a scientist to help them counteract the Alliance's efforts.  On Terok Nor, {{mu|Rom}} is on the station to inform the Intendant that Sisko is alive… and that he has information that will lead to Sisko's recapture.   ===Act Three=== Sisko and Smiley, in a fighter, soon become surrounded by ''decloaking'' Alliance ships en route to Terok Nor, captured, and taken to the station. The first thing Sisko does upon leaving the airlock is to kiss the Intendant passionately, and they briefly discuss the likelihood of his execution. Kira then moves onto O'Brien and chastises him for betraying the Alliance. After Smiley explains that he did it because he wanted to be free, Kira contemptuously orders him sent back to Ore Processing, and she leads Sisko back to her quarters. Once there, she explains to him that since she can't trust him, it will be a matter of time before she needs to ""dispose of"" him. Later, Jennifer arrives, accompanied by Garak, who leaves no doubt as to his hatred of Sisko. After Garak leaves, Ben and Jennifer spar over Ben's bellicosity and womanizing, but Ben puts that to a stop by explaining that he's on the station to rescue her.   ===Act Four=== After more arguing, Ben uses the adversarial nature of their marriage as a wedge to suggest that she's working for the Alliance as a response to his leadership of the rebellion, and finally asks her to defect as an alternative to slavery. Sisko tells her to think about it, then uses a subdermal [[communicator]] to alert Smiley to his progress and disables the guards on the Intendant's quarters. Smiley creates a diversion to get himself and several slaves out of Ore Processing, while subduing a few guards in the process.   With Ben guarding the door with two Klingon [[disruptor]]s, Jennifer ultimately agrees to follow him &ndash; though only after insisting that she ''still'' hates him &ndash; and the two of them meet up with Smiley and the (former) slaves in the Habitat Ring. They need to coordinate to subdue a few Cardassian soldiers, but they successfully reach the airlock where Rom's shuttle is docked, only to discover Rom's corpse hanging from the airlock door, by a dagger through the chest.  ===Act Five=== On the verge of being overpowered by the Intendant and her men and with no obvious means of leaving Terok Nor, the rebels head back to Ore Processing with Jennifer in tow. Once there, the rebels engage in a firefight with the guards, and after promising Jennifer that he will get her off the station, Sisko starts manipulating a console, explaining to Smiley that he hopes the designer of the Mirror Universe Terok Nor is the same Cardassian who designed [[Deep Space 9]].  The Intendant and the troops with her ultimately force entry to the rebels' haven in Ore Processing, where she orders the rebels (excepting Jennifer) killed &ndash; only to have Sisko tell her that doing so would be a mistake… because he has initiated the station's [[auto-destruct]] sequence. Thinking that he's bluffing, the Intendant points out to Sisko that he doesn't know the needed [[command authorization code]], at which point he proves her wrong. When she tries to stop the sequence, she discovers that Sisko has ''changed'' the command code, and offers to let him off the station if he will give her the new code. He demands that he and his companions be let off the station first, and the Intendant capitulates, closing with an oath to Sisko that she will hunt him down.  After the trip from Terok Nor to the rebel base, Jennifer insists on knowing who Ben ''really'' is. Commander Sisko tells her that she can ask Smiley to fill her in on the details, and then the two of them say their goodbyes when Smiley arrives to take Sisko back [[prime universe|home]].   "

A genie comes out of the bottle and offers to grant the Castles four wishes. Arthur's first wish, for the sake of arguement, is for the broken glass in the display case to be repaired, which the genie does to prove himself. They next wish for a million dollars in cash, some of which they give to their friends. An employee of the IRS gives the Castles a tax that will only leave them $5 once it's paid.  The genie warns the Castles that their wishes have consequences and advises to pick their next one wisely. After consideration, Arthur wishes to be the leader of a modern country where he can't be voted out of office and he becomes Adolf Hitler at the end of World War II when he's given cyanide to kill himself in his bunker. Picking up the vial, Castle uses his last wish to return to his old life and throws it on the floor, then is instantly back at the curio shop, shattering the bottle. While sweeping, Arthur accidentally breaks the glass in the display case, officially returning the Castles to their normal lives before the genie appeared. All they have to show for their wishes is a new perspective on life. Arthur dumps the pieces in the trash can where they magically form back into the bottle, waiting for someone else to take it."

== Summary ==
===Introduction===
The [[Centauri]] agricultural colony on [[Ragesh III]] is [[Invasion of Ragesh III|attacked]] by an unknown force exiting [[hyperspace]]. On [[Babylon 5]], [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Susan Ivanova]], the new second-in-command of the station after [[Laurel Takashima]] was reassigned, is in search of [[Commander]] [[Jeffrey Sinclair]] in the [[Zócalo]]. She finds him in the [[Observation dome]] to let him know there is a problem. [[Ambassador]] [[Londo Mollari]] approaches [[Garibaldi]] to ask him for a favor, but is interrupted by his new aide, [[Vir Cotto]], who informs him that Ragesh III has been attacked.

=== Act I ===
[[Minbari]] Ambassador Delenn and [[Narn]] Ambassador [[G'Kar]] enter and offer their condolences. Mollari is suspicious that the Narns had something to do with it, but G'Kar adamantly proclaims his ignorance. Mollari plans to call an emergency meeting of the [[Babylon 5 Advisory Council]] and the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]] later.

A transport ship sends word to the station that they are under attack by Raiders. Ivanova tells Garibaldi, who takes a small [[Starfury]] flight to investigate. Just as he leaves, commercial telepath [[Talia Winters]] steps into [[C'n'C]] to report her arrival on the station, per [[Psi Corps]] regulations, only to get a notably cold shoulder from Ivanova, who leaves to find Sinclair. She finds him in his office, listening to the election coverage of the [[Earth Alliance]] presidency. They spend time trying to figure out who could have taken part in the attack of Ragesh III, but do not come up with any clear conclusions. She's astonished when Sinclair insists that the Minbari could not have been responsible, that he considers them too honourable to commit such a sneak attack, despite his own history as a veteran of the Earth-Minbari War. Sinclair explains to Ivanova about his grandfather, who inspired him to join [[Earthforce]] and taught him ""to ignore the propaganda...to focus on what he can see.""

Mollari soon receives footage of the attack and identifies the vessels as [[Narn]]. Mollari storms off to find G'Kar.

In deep space, Garibaldi and his wingman find the remains of the attacked transport, stripped bare with no survivors.

Mollari finds G'Kar in the Zócalo and threatens retaliation, which G'Kar mocks and then extends his own threats. Mollari has to be physically restrained by station security from assaulting G'Kar.

=== Act II ===
In the aftermath, Mollari and Sinclair speak in the former's quarters. Mollari apologizes for the incident with G'Kar and tells Sinclair of a prophetic dream he once had, a vision of his own death were he sees himself and G'Kar, both twenty years older, strangling each other to death. Sinclair tells him things can change in twenty years, but Mollari is convinced it will happen. Sinclair also tells Mollari he is calling the Advisory Council and the League, hopeful he can form a coalition against the Narn attack. Mollari explains that to keep his nephew, [[Carn Mollari]], safe from harm, he personally arranged for him to have a higher position &ndash; on Ragesh III. He may have sealed his fate. Mollari then explains that interstellar diplomacy is all a game, and that the only thing that matters is blood. He swears that if Carn is dead, if it is the last thing he does, he will see war against the Narn.

Sinclair goes to visit [[Vorlon]] Ambassador [[Kosh]]. Kosh agrees to attend the emergency council session Sinclair has called, but declines to help, instead offering a cryptic remark. In C'n'C, Garibaldi suspects that transport routes (typically kept secret to prevent Raider attacks) have been leaked somehow. He investigates to find a link between the transports hit and the supply routes. He also notes that, judging from the state of the destroyed transport, that the Raiders are packing much more powerful weapons than usual.

Mollari soon finds out that the Centauri government has decided to take no action to the attack &ndash; citing the colony is too far, too small, and too unimportant to risk a confrontation. He tells Vir Cotto that they will not tell the Council of this, to see if the other races can take action and thus embarrass the Centauri government into acting.

Winters runs into Garibaldi in a transport tube and asks why Ivanova seems so standoffish. Garibaldi recommends she try talking to Ivanova in her off-duty hours at the casino. He then invites her back to his quarters to see ""his second favorite thing in the whole universe.""

G'Kar encounters Sinclair in the [[Zen Garden]], reflecting quietly before the Council meeting. G'Kar reflects on the Centauri occupation, and about his dream to wipe the Centauri out completely. He also points out that the Narns were one of the few races to supply weapons to Earth during the [[Earth-Minbari War]]. Sinclair rebukes G'Kar's assertion that Earth ""owes"" the Narn Regime, proclaiming that the Narns ""will sell to anyone who can pay"", and criticizing the Narn for a cowardly attack on a civilian colony.

After leaving the garden, Sinclair is met by Garibaldi, who has discovered that one company that sold transport routes is the common link between all the attacks. They are now fairly convinced of what the Raiders' next attack will be.

=== Act III ===
Sinclair speaks with an Earth Alliance Senator, asking for authorization to vote for military intervention. The Senator is hesitant to authorize action so close to an election, and tells him to abstain from the vote. Ivanova, who has been watching from the doorway, informs him that a flight of Starfuries is ready to intercept some [[raiders]], Garibaldi believing he has discovered the leak. Sinclair comes up with the plan to lead the mission himself. Telling Ivanova that she ""never heard"" the conversation, Ivanova is left to chair the council meeting and vote in support of sanctions.

During the council meeting, G'Kar's explanation of why the Narn attacked was because a hundred years ago the planet had been a Narn colony. Ambassador [[Delenn]] admonishes G'Kar for being willing to invade a colony over blood spilled so long ago. G'Kar rebuffs the allegations of invasion, insisting they were invited to come by the colonists. He introduces a transmission from Ragesh III, from Carn Mollari, who claims that they had asked for Narn assistance. Londo Mollari believes it to be a coerced statement, and not factual, but while the others present suspect he is right, there is no proof. G'Kar motions that the charges be dismissed, and the motion passes.

Meanwhile, in deep space, Sinclair and his Starfury wing successfully track down the Raiders in the midst of the latest attack on a transport.

=== Act IV ===
Sinclair's fighter wing engages the Raider vessels, easily scattering them and saving the transport. Following the skirmish, Sinclair's wing locates the Raider's command and control vessel.

Back on the station, Mollari assembles a hidden weapon to kill G'Kar. On his way to kill him, he crosses paths with Winters, who gets a telepathic vision of what he plans to do. She reports this directly to Garibaldi, who quickly intercepts Mollari and convinces him not to go through with it. Instead, Garbaldi convinces Mollari to return to his quarters and wait for Security to arrive to search it for weapons.

Sinclair approaches G'Kar with his discovery from the raiders' base: a Narn officer, supplied along with weapons sold to the raiders by the Narn. Intercepted transmissions logged on the base also confirm Mollari's assertions that the attack on Ragesh III was entirely unprovoked. Sinclair threatens to bring the evidence before the Council unless Narn forces withdraw from Ragesh III.

Ivanova explains why she has been avoiding Winters, that her mother had refused to join the Psi Corps, and opted to take [[sleepers]] to suppress her telepathic abilities instead of going to prison. The drugs lead Ivanova's mother into a deep depression, ultimately lead to her suicide.

=== Act V ===
Garibaldi has convinced Ambassador Delenn to come back to his quarters with him, where they share popcorn and a night of watching [[Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century|Duck Dodgers]], although the comedy is lost on her.

Sinclair watches election returns, showing a victory for the incumbent president [[Luis Santiago]].

==Short Summary==
A woman desperate to boost her social media score hits the jackpot when she's invited to a swanky wedding. But the trip doesn't go as planned.

==Full Summary==
[[Lacie Pound]] lives in a world where anyone can rate your personality out of five stars, from your friends to strangers you meet on the street. Obsessed with being received well, she currently has an approval rating around 4.2. She lives with her brother [[Ryan Pound|Ryan]], who has a lower approval rating than her, and she is eager to move out. She learns that to be able to afford to live in an apartment on an exclusive estate, she must have a rating of 4.5 or above, and is informed the best way to improve her rating is to socialise with people in the higher circles of society. Her childhood best friend [[Naomi Blestow|Naomi]] contacts her and asks her to be her maid of honour, which Lacie delightedly accepts. Naomi, who has a rating of 4.8, has many upper-class friends and lives on an exclusive and idealistic island. Lacie believes if she nails a perfect maid of honour speech, she will be flooded with enough 5-star ratings to pull her approval up to the 4.5 she needs, so pays the security deposit for the apartment.

At the airport, Lacie is informed her original flight has been cancelled, and she needs 4.2 to get a seat on another. However, due to a row with Ryan and several unfortunate encounters with strangers, her rating has dropped into the 4.1s, so she is refused the seat. She causes a scene at the airport, and security drops her rating a whole star for 24 hours, to 3.1, and inform her that during that period all downvotes will incur a double multiplier. This means that she can only rent an old model of a car so she can drive to Naomi's wedding. When the car loses charge and she cannot find a way to charge it, Lacie decides to hitchhike but her rating, which has now descended to below 3, puts people off picking her up with some people ranking her down for no reason as they drive past. Eventually an older woman driving a truck, [[Susan Taylor|Susan]], offers to give her a ride. Lacie initially refuses as Susan's rating is 1.4 but eventually accepts. During the drive Susan reveals she too was obsessed with ratings, until her husband missed out on vital cancer treatment because his rating was .1 lower than another patient, leading to his death. Susan then decided to no longer care what people thought of her and started being honest and although a lot of her so-called friends turned against her she felt better for it and encourages Lacie to do the same. Susan drops Lacie off, however Naomi calls Lacie and tells her not to come due to her rating, which has dropped to 2.6. She admits that she only invited Lacie in the first place because having an old school friend in the low 4's would play well with her guests and help improve her own rating.

Lacie gets drunk and decides to go anyway, breaking into the island and gatecrashing the wedding reception. She drunkenly performs her speech, embarrassing herself and ripping into Naomi for sleeping with her high school boyfriend. All the guests subsequently rank her down causing Lacie's rating to plummet to 0.6, though Lacie is unfazed by this. She attacks Naomi's new husband, Paul (Alan Ritchson), with a knife when he tries to restrain her. She is arrested, has the technology removed, and is placed in prison. However, she finds herself surprisingly happy, exchanging insults with the prisoner opposite (Sope Dirisu), without fear of being ranked down.

== Summary ==
Aeons ago, a [[GELF|genetically-engineered]] [[polymorph]] was the ultimate warrior, able to change its own shape to ""suit its terrain and deceive its enemies"", and also emotionally crippling the enemy to disorientate them. Sealed away inside a [[Genetic Waste Pod]], where it remained for three million years, it was eventually able to escape, unfortunately for the blissfully unaware [[boys from the Dwarf]], just as the ''[[Red Dwarf (ship)|Red Dwarf]]'' is passing by. The GELF enters the [[cargo bays]] by chewing a hole in the hull, and begins to seek out victims, taking dozens of different forms as it goes, such as an [[alarm clock]], a [[rabbits|rabbit]] and a bouncing beach ball.

Meanwhile, in the [[sleeping quarters#Officer.27s_Quarters|Officer's Quarters]], [[Dave Lister]] cooks his ""[[Shami Kebab Diablo]]"" using a whole tub of chilli powder - a dish which he is proud to point out that once put [[Olaf Petersen]] in [[Medi-Bot|sick bay]] for a week - for himself and [[Cat]]. This is Lister's attempt at more 'classy' dining, and he wanted to do something a little 'different', involving using items from the medical unit; this includes using an embryo refrigeration unit to store the food, using surgical trays as plates, using scalpels instead of knives, and a bovine artificial insemination syringe to serve lemon juice. Cat is disgusted, with him calling it more of an autopsy than a meal, and he leaves. [[Kryten]] then enters and finishes off the cleaning of the Officer's Quarters with his [[Groinal Attachment]], accidentally sucking up a penny in the process and shaking violently.

When the Shammi Kebab Diablo suddenly jumps off the plate and around Lister's neck, Lister throws it across the room. Putting on his boxer shorts, they suddenly begin shrinking around his groin, and Lister falls to the ground as he attempts to remove them. As Lister pleads for Kryten to help take them off, [[Arnold Rimmer]] walks in and gets the wrong impression, saying that he's not surprised since Lister will bonk anything. The boxers then shape-shift again, this time turning into an anaconda - Lister's second worst fear - and then into an ""eight foot tall armour-plated alien killing machine"" - his worst fear - taking Lister to the very limit of terror. The polymorph then drains Lister of all his fear with a plunger-like tongue on Lister's forehead. It then quickly escapes from the quarters, leaving Lister unconscious.

The others get Lister up to the [[Science Room]], where Kryten runs some tests and deduces that Lister has been drained of all his fear. After Kryten explains what the [[polymorph]] is, and that it feeds on negative emotion, Lister wakes up wanting to fight the polymorph - saying they should get out there and ""twat it"" - and also fight everybody else present. Kryten sedates him, and Rimmer says their [[plan]] should be to ""run away"", and so they go down to the [[shuttle bays|shuttle hangars]]. As they load up supplies from the [[cargo bays|cargo bay]], Cat is forced to run from their own accidentally-fired heat-seeking [[bazookoid]] fire, although with his lightning reflexes Cat is able to trap the fire-bolts in an airlock.

Full of pride, Cat is seduced by a woman, Genny. Genny reveals herself to be the genetic mutant, but Cat doesn't click on, and after offering sex and inflating his ego, proceeds to drain Cat of all his vanity. This turns Cat into a very out-of-character drunken, smelly tramp with a low opinion of himself. Kryten and Rimmer then find him, and Rimmer tells Kryten it is his fault as he let Cat run off alone, causing the [[mechanoid]]'s guilt chip to go into overdrive. Rimmer reveals himself as the Polymorph and drains Kryten of all his guilt, breaking Kryten's programming. Kryten immediately develops a selfish and insulting demeanor, and no longer cares about his crew-mates.

They then go back up to the [[Science Room]] and meet up with Lister to find [[Arnold Rimmer's Mother|Rimmer's mother]] apparently having just had sex with Lister, which an amused Kryten points out contradicts Arnold's ""very prim, very proper, almost austere"" view of her and further enrages Rimmer. He initially tries to keep his cool, but between Lister's attempts to provoke a fight, Kryten's taunting, and ""Mrs. Rimmer"" telling him how Lister made love to her using Alphabetti Spaghetti, Rimmer blows his top and the polymorph (who was in Mrs. Rimmer's form) drains Rimmer of all his anger.

The Dwarfers then discuss their next move, and [[Holly]] tries to rally them to fight the polymorph while it rests after its four-course meal, however being drained of their emotions means they don't get very far in preparing a plan of attack. Lister is determined to take out the Polymorph through the most violent means possible (especially if he gets the chance to kill himself in the process), even suggesting letting the others ambush while it eats him to death, or strapping on a [[Mining torpedo|nuclear warhead]] to his head and headbutting it. Rimmer is now a glasses-wearing pacifist donning a t-shirt which reads 'give quiche a chance' who plans to hit the Polymorph with a leaflet campaign followed by benefit concerts; Cat feels he is too worthless to venture an opinion; and Kryten is too busy dishing out insults and working out if he can survive by sacrificing the others to offer any kind of valid opinion. It's eventually decided, in lieu of an actual plan, to head down to face the polymorph and hope for the best.

The Dwarfers go down to the [[cargo bays]] to confront the polymorph, but they accidentally release the still-active heat-seeking bazookoid energy bolts which Cat had evaded earlier and sealed in the airlock. With a quick duck, the released bolts hit the polymorph which was emerging in full form behind them, exploding it.

The polymorph's demise instantly restores their altered personalities, and Kryten offers to commit suicide due to the guilt, and Cat and Rimmer are horrified as to what they are wearing. As they walk off, a second polymorph that was in the same pod has turned into Lister, smiling.

''The second polymorph is not seen again. In the [[Red Dwarf Remastered|remastered version]], the second stowed away in Lister's clean underpants drawer, where it died of old age many years later.''

==Plot==
The [[Planet Express crew]] manage to bring [[Calculon]] back from the dead. After he discovers he was replaced on [[All My Circuits]] with [[Vaxtron]], Calculon stars in his own one-man show.

==Summary==
The episode starts with [[Linda van Schoonhoven]] and [[Morbo]]'s show ""Entertainment and Earth Invasions Tonite"". After Morbo does an intro for his interview with [[Extermulo]], the General from his home [[Planet]], Linda is shown at the burial site of Calculon, where fans have come to mourn the loss of Calculon on the anniversary of his death. Linda interviews [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] and [[Bender Bending Rodríguez|Bender]], the latter of whom explains that ''All My Circuits'' hasn't been good since Calculon died. After the interview, they rush home to watch a new ''All My Circuits'', only to complain about the new main character, Vaxtron. Fry begins to wish that they could bring Calculon back to life, which [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] replies is possible. The Professor explains that since Calculon was a [[Robot]], they can reboot his system into his original body using science. First, they need Calculon's body, which Bender promptly exhumes. Then, the Professor explains they now need Calculon's soul, which was in Limbo because he committed suicide, meaning they would have to venture to Robot Hell to retrieve it.

Meanwhile, in Robot Hell, Calculon is expressing his sadness of not being alive, much to the Robot Devil's annoyance. Just then, Fry and Bender arrive planning to reclaim a soul. The Robot Devil refuses, but promptly changes his mind after learning the soul is that of Calculon. Fry challenges the Robot Devil for Calculon's soul. If he wins, he wins the soul; if he loses, The Robot Devil gets to kill them. Soon, Fry wins the challenge, although he guessed wrong (he had to guess what number the Robot Devil was thinking, which was between 1 and 3) - the Robot Devil, tired of the hammy windbag, hands over Calculon's soul and tells them to leave.

Back at Planet Express, the Professor and the Planet Express team get ready to bring Calculon back with ""science"" (though as Hermes points out, it seems like a satanic ritual). First, everyone puts their protective cloaks on, then place five wireless networks around Calculon's body (which creates a pentagram), Amy then plays Calculon's installation disc backward (it says, ""Rise from the dead in the name of Satan"") while the professor sacrifices a mechanical goat for its main hard-drive and installs it into one of the wireless networks which sends an electric pulse into Calculon's body and returns his soul to his body. Calculon wakes up in a woozy state, but once he snaps out of it, he is thrilled to be alive again. The Planet Express team expresses joy and the Professor screams ""Hail Science!"" (as his hood falls off showing the number 666 on his forehead).

The next day Fry, Leela, Bender and Calculon all watch the new episode of All My Circuits. Calculon shows disgust at the fact they replaced him with Vaxtron. They all fly to Hollywood to get Calculon's job back. They meet with the execubots and learn that Calculon cannot return to his job on All My Circuits because his acting style is outdated. Back at Planet Express, they watch on TV and learn that Calculon's star on the walk of fame has been removed and replaced with a second star for [[Robert Wagner's head]]. Depressed, Calculon decides to try the one man play he created many years ago but never got around to performing. Soon enough, everyone is at Calculon's performance of his play. After the first night: Fry, Leela and Bender take Calculon out to celebrate at The Tragic Pan and learn that the play received horrible reviews and twelve people are hospitalized from boredom. Even more depressed, Calculon blames Fry, Bender and Leela for bringing him back and promises to never act again.

The following morning, Calculon packs his things and prepares to leave for good. Leela, noticing how depressed he truly is, believes that after being knocked down so many times he is actually showing true acting talent. Leela tells Calculon to audition for a small role on All My Circuits in disguise. They all go to the All My Circuits auditions: Calculon receives his old role (although they don't know it's him, they give him the role because he looks like he could act badly enough to be Calculon). At the set, Calculon reminisces on how he used to feel like the king when he was on set. But after several minutes, he returns to his old ways. During his big scene with Monique, Calculon complains about the script and the director cuts the scene. He threatens Calculon that he has one more chance or he's fired. Calculon, not used to second takes, begins to scream about how he was the star and doesn't do second takes. Leela, getting annoyed with his attitude, tells Calculon how he was always a lousy actor, that no one missed him when he died and that he was better off dead to begin with. She also mentions that his acting days are over and he should give up. Being told this, Calculon begins to feel depressed again. When re-doing the scene, Calculon's acting is more believable, to the point where some begin to cry. After being asked who he is by the Director, Calculon removes his disguise shocking everyone except the Planet Express team. Everyone applauds Calculon and asks him to take a bow. Calculon, now a little more humble feels he doesn't deserve it. Leela encourages him to take the bow. Unfortunately, the noose he hung in the scene falls and some stage lights crash. Calculon is relieved that it didn't kill him. Before he can finish his sentence an entire catwalk lands on him, killing him once again.

The day after his passing, The Mayor officially puts Calculon's star back on the walk of fame, feeling Calculon deserves it. The Robot Devil and Calculon's spirit are watching as Calculon's star is reinstalled and Calculon begins to feel loved once again. The Robot Devil, annoyed with Calculon returning, turns the TV off. Calculon then offers to perform his one man play for everyone in Robot Hell: the Robot Devil screams, ""Haven't they suffered enough?!""

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0," == Summary == === Teaser ===  In his [[quarters]], [[Worf]] rehearses, a little nervously, how he will explain to his son [[Alexander Rozhenko|Alexander]] what it means to be a true [[Klingon]] warrior. Alexander dashes in, pursued by his friend [[Eric Burton|Eric]] with a [[fullerene]] water balloon. He misses Alexander and instead hits Worf, who is not amused. However, he continues with his explanation.  He tells Alexander that there are actually two [[Rite of Ascension]] ceremonies; Alexander won't be required to pass through the second rite (the one with [[painstik]]s) until he is older, but is old enough for the first rite now. His fighting skills and his knowledge of the teachings of [[Kahless]] will be tested, and Worf promises to help him with this. The first step is lighting a [[kor'tova candle]] and declaring one's intention to be a Klingon warrior.   Alexander doesn't want to do it, reminding Worf that his mother [[K'Ehleyr]] [[Reunion (episode)|told him]] he didn't have to do any ""Klingon stuff"" he didn't want to. Worf agrees that it must be Alexander's choice, and Alexander runs out of the room, declaring that he has no intention of becoming a warrior.  === Act One === The {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-D|-D}} is supposed to rendezvous with another ship, the ''[[Kearsarge]]'', but it won't arrive for another four days, so the [[senior staff]] plan extra activities. [[Captain]] [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] wants to visit the [[Hatarian system]] where there's an [[archaeology|archaeological]] dig, and [[Data]] suggests [[stellar dynamics]] can have more access to the lateral sensor grid to examine the [[Vodrey Nebula]]. Picard notices that Worf looks distracted during the briefing, and Worf explains afterwards about the problems he is having with Alexander. Picard suggests that the ''Enterprise'' detour to the Klingon [[outpost]] on [[Maranga IV]] where they'll be celebrating [[Kot'baval Festival|Kot'baval]] and Alexander can immerse himself in Klingon culture and folklore; this will also give Stellar Dynamics a chance to see the entire nebula, as the outpost lies on the other side of it.  On Maranga, the festival is in full swing; there is almost a county fair atmosphere, what with the vendors and the banners and the colorful re-enactments of Klingon history. Worf and Alexander watch one such drama, in which the story of how Kahless defeated the traitor [[Molor]] is shown. The actor playing Molor issues repeated challenges to ''[[bat'leth]]'' duels, and audience members are invited to participate. Alexander is caught up in the excitement and accepts a challenge. The actor takes a fall to let Alexander win.   After spending a full day at the festival and even making some friends among the Klingon children at the outpost, Alexander meets up with Worf, who is waiting for him. Alexander explains that he needs fifty [[darsek]]s to see the [[mummy|mummified]] head of Molor but Worf believes the man who is offering this is simply trying to take his money. Worf tells his son it is time to go and promises they will return tomorrow. They are about to return to the ''Enterprise'' when a trio of armed Klingon warriors appear from the shadows, cornering them.  === Act Two === Before the fight starts, an older Klingon man comes out of the shadows of an alley and fires a [[Klingon disruptor|disruptor]] at one of the assailants. Worf takes on the other two, shouting to Alexander to run. The older Klingon helps to defeat them, and they run away. Worf recognizes the man as [[K'mtar]], ''[[gin'tak]]'' or adviser to the [[House of Mogh]].   They beam aboard the ''Enterprise'' where [[Commander]] [[William T. Riker|Riker]] wants to question them, unhappy with K'mtar's reluctance to answer. K'mtar shows the dagger dropped by one of the assailants. It bears the insignia of the rival [[House of Duras]], indicating that [[Lursa]] and [[B'Etor]] are behind the attack. They have not been heard from [[Past Prologue (episode)|since they tried to sell]] [[bilitrium]] [[explosive]]s to a [[Tahna Los|Bajoran terrorist]] on [[Deep Space 9]]. They are after the seat on the [[Klingon High Council]] now held by Worf's brother [[Kurn]], who has sent K'mtar to protect Worf and his child and put a stop to the sisters' treachery. Riker says the next step will be to track down the sisters. Riker offers to help find them and gives K'mtar quarters on the ship.   Worf and K'mtar leave to his quarters. K'mtar relates Kurn's concern about Alexander, as he has no male heir and so Alexander may have to lead the House of Mogh someday. Kurn believes in Worf's ability to teach him, but it can't be easy being the only two Klingons on a starship full of [[Human]]s. He inquires how Alexander is doing as far as his Klingon warrior skills, and Worf says he is not as good as he should be, because he doesn't take time to practice as all Klingon youths do. K'mtar promises to help, and Worf accepts. Very gently (for a Klingon), he approaches Alexander's bedside and speaks in warm, understanding tones, telling him that learning warrior's skills will help Alexander to feel that not only he, but his father, are safe from harm. Worf, around the corner, is a little uneasy that there is another voice influencing Alexander, but he does trust him.  === Act Three ===  The next day, on the [[bridge]], Riker has Worf contact Deep Space 9 while Data searches records for the Duras sisters. Data does not find any more information, and so Riker turns to DS9. He bribes information out of the station's [[bartender]] [[Quark]] as to what the Duras sisters are doing and where they are. To get the information out of Quark, Riker offers to return his [[voucher]]s he received when he won playing [[dabo]] while at Deep Space 9 instead of [[latinum]], which Quark did not have enough of to cover his winnings of twelve bars. Quark then explains he heard a rumor that Lursa and B'Etor were trying to buy some secondhand [[mining]] equipment to dig up a [[magnesite]] deposit (which actually belongs to the [[Pakled]]s) in the [[Kalla system]]. Riker promises to send the vouchers back to Quark, but he had them voided while they were speaking.  While the ''Enterprise'' travels to the Kalla system, K'mtar comes up with a [[holodeck]] simulation different from what Alexander is used to. Instead of just going through the exercises, he proposes a re-enactment of what happened on Maranga. As Alexander goes up against one of the attackers, K'mtar freezes the program at various points to illustrate how Alexander can take advantage of his opponent. Alexander knocks the attacker to the ground but won't kill him. When K'mtar angrily insists, Alexander gets disgusted and runs away.  When the ''Enterprise'' arrives at [[Kalla III]] and beams down an away team, they find a lone [[Dopterian]], [[Gorta]]. In exchange for passage off planet, he tells them that the sisters have already left, taking everything of value with them (and stranding him). The plan had been to sell the magnesite ore to a [[Yridian]] trader in the [[Ufandi system]].  In [[Ten Forward]], K'mtar meets up with Worf. He apologizes for his anger earlier and suggests that Alexander be sent to a Klingon school on [[Ogat]]. Worf dislikes the idea because Alexander is at home on the ''Enterprise'', but K'mtar says it is almost impossible to learn true Klingon ways under these conditions. He again gets heated and says he might have to invoke the ''[[ya'nora kor]]'', a law which can remove a child from unfit parental custody. Outraged, Worf asks if he questions his fitness as a parent. K'mtar says that for the good of their House, yes, he is indeed. He only wants what is best for the boy. However, K'mtar is growing increasingly angry and frustrated with Alexander, who questions traditional Klingon stories and disagrees that it is so vitally important that he become a warrior.  === Act Four === K'mtar sits Alexander down to try to teach him the Klingon ways, telling him more of Kahless and [[Morath]]. Alexander listens, but cuts him off, saying he already knows the story. K'mtar says it's important to tell it even if it's known, but Alexander starts questioning each statement like an inquisitive Human would. K'mtar is increasingly frustrated, saying those details don't matter, but rather the Klingon warrior interpretation. He then tells Alexander about the school, but he says he doesn't want to leave the ''Enterprise''. He realizes K'mtar is just like his father, only caring about being a warrior, and leaves.  Meanwhile, Riker has tracked down the ore taken by the sisters to the Yridian trader [[Yog]], and buys it from him for half a gram of [[Anjoran bio-mimetic gel]]. Instead of beaming it to the ''Enterprise'', though, Riker blows up the ore in space with the ship's [[phaser]]s, and discovers a [[cloak]]ed [[Klingon Bird-of-Prey|Bird-of-Prey]] ship nearby. He has found the sisters, and soon brings them aboard. Telling them he knows the ore was stolen, he confronts them with the [[assassination]] attempt on Worf and shows them the dagger. They claim to know nothing about it, and Riker asks K'mtar about his other evidence which he claims to be on the homeworld. Riker prepares to set a course and K'mtar leaves to contact Kurn. However, after he leaves, B'Etor notices something on the dagger which clearly shocks her and Lursa, upon seeing it, claims that what's she's seeing is impossible. Riker asks what's going on, and B'Etor tells him the crest on the dagger has symbols representing the various members of the family&hellip; including Lursa's son. Lursa says she doesn't have a son, but she is expecting a child and only found out a few days previously and told no-one but B'Etor who furiously demands to know where the dagger came from. Based of their reactions and the evidence, it's now clear that the sisters weren't responsible for the assassination attempt, and the officers are left astounded by this mysterious turn of events. Worf decides to go and speak with K'mtar about the origin of the dagger.   Worf immediately goes to ask K'mtar about this, but discovers him apparently preparing to kill Alexander with his disruptor. After a brief struggle, he throws K'mtar to the ground and prepares to strangle him. But K'mtar cries out, calling him father and that he is actually Alexander himself.  === Act Five === Worf demands proof and asks him what his mother's last words were. K'mtar tells him of how he witnessed the death of K'Ehleyr, and that all she said was his name, and she put his hand in Worf's. ""''And then you howled in rage, and said 'Look at her. Look upon death, and always remember.' And I always have.''"" He reluctantly lets him go and picks up the disruptor. Alexander explains that he has come back from forty years in the future, with the assistance of a man that he met in the [[Cambra system]]. Alexander did not want to end his own life, but rather to change things, to influence his younger self to follow a different path. He explains that he never became a Klingon warrior, but a diplomat and peacemaker, who sought to put an end to the centuries of struggle and feuding between the Great Houses. He had declared that the House of Mogh would no longer engage in vengeance or blood feuds. Worf warned him that this was a show of weakness, but Alexander insisted this was the way of the future. Almost immediately thereafter, Alexander witnessed Worf's murder on the floor of the [[Great Hall]] of the Klingon High Council. He thought that, if he had become a warrior, he'd have been able to stand with his father and defeat the assassins. So he came back to persuade his younger self to follow that ancient path, first by staging the assassination attempt on Maranga, then by trying to awaken young Alexander's interest in being just like all the other Klingons, as well as in protecting his father. He despaired when he saw that he had failed.  Worf says that Alexander has already changed history by coming back in time, and that things may not at all happen the way he fears. Worf explains that he must die with honor, and he cannot do that unless his son is true to himself and his beliefs. This means that Alexander must return to the future and continue to work for peace. Even a Klingon can see that peace is a worthy and just cause, and Worf believes Alexander has a noble future ahead of him. K'mtar says that he has failed, because the boy he was remains the same. Worf says that Alexander is the same, but Worf has changed, and now he understands that Alexander will have a noble future even if he is not a warrior. K'mtar embraces him and says, ""I love you, father."" Worf replies, ""And I you, Alexander.""  Later, young Alexander is waiting for Worf and K'mtar in the holodeck to begin ''bat'leth'' practice. Worf explains that K'mtar had to leave suddenly, but asked him to say goodbye, and that he will always respect Alexander no matter what he decides to do with his life. Worf, too, has come to respect Alexander, and suggests that they simply spend time together as father and son. "

==Summary==
===Teaser===

A young woman named [[Emi]] is grasping [[Quark]]'s [[lobes|ears]] from behind, presumably giving him or leading up to [[oo-mox]], as he is obviously enjoying the experience. She is attempting to get Quark to finalize a deal whereby she will purchase [[self-sealing stem bolt]]s from him, but he says it can wait since Emi's family will not return to [[Deep Space 9]] for another week. [[Rom]] enters Quark's [[quarters]] and ruins the party, telling his brother that they need to leave. However, it is too late; [[Grand Nagus]] [[Zek]] and his servant [[Maihar'du]] enter behind Rom moments later. Maihar'du gestures at Emi to leave Quark's quarters and she promptly does. Although Zek's head is covered and Maihar'du does not speak as usual, it seems the Nagus plans to move in with Quark.

===Act One===
Elsewhere on [[Deep Space 9]], [[Doctor]] [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]] is in the [[infirmary]] and is called to the [[wardroom]] by [[Commander]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]], where he learns from the station's commander that, for his work in [[Biomolecular replication]], he has been nominated for the [[Carrington Award]], the [[Federation]]'s most prestigious medical award, and finds the entire [[senior staff]] waiting for him to congratulate him on being the youngest nominee in the award's history. Despite the honor he seems less than enthusiastic, to everyone's surprise. He later confides in [[Jadzia Dax|Dax]] (who submitted his name for consideration) that the Carrington Award honors a lifetime of achievement in the field of medicine and, as such, most people nominated are far older than he is. As a result, he knows he has no chance of winning due to his youth. Bashir excuses himself awkwardly shortly after.

Meanwhile, Quark has moved into Rom's untidy quarters and has found living with his brother unbearable. Nog is visiting his [[Ishka|grandmother]] on [[Ferenginar]], so the place is messier than usual. Quark is further angered that his [[Aldebaran whiskey]] and other items such as tables and chairs from the bar have been taken. He decides that the two of them &ndash; or rather, Rom &ndash; will confront the Nagus to find out what is going on. As soon as he observes that Zek is more than happy to see Rom, Quark comes out from his nearby hiding place and greets the Nagus. Quark and Rom find that Zek has composed his ""crowning achievement"": ''[[The Rules of Acquisition: Revised for the Modern Ferengi]]''. Zek gives them a copy and leaves them to read it; Quark is excited, until he reads the first rule in it: ""''If they want their money back, give it to them.''"" The two then notice Maihar'du crying in the corner.

===Act Two===
Quark attempts to find some sort of master plan in the Nagus' work, looking for a secret code hidden within the ""new rules"" &ndash; he and Rom attempt to ""discover"" the code by reading one word from each page (which, naturally, translate as gibberish), but the two are hilariously unsuccessful. Still convinced the new rules are part of a scheme, he decides to go along with it for now. 

Later, Quark and Rom are in the [[Quark's Bar, Grill, Gaming House and Holosuite Arcade|bar]] when Zek arrives. Continuing to exhibit his vastly different new personality, Zek buys a round of drinks for everyone, since it will make them happy and, in turn, will make him happy. Quark goes along with it and offers Zek [[Hupyrian beetle snuff]], however, he refuses, saying it's not fun for the beetles. Quark is then horrified to learn that Zek has told Emi where she could buy self-sealing stem bolts at wholesale; much less than what he was offering. He said he was concerned she was taken advantage of. Quark walks off, and Rom expresses his surprise. Zek says it will take time to get used to the ""new ways"" and asks Rom to walk with him.

Meanwhile, Bashir and O'Brien are playing [[darts]] in a [[cargo bay]], as they have been playing much too many [[racquetball]] games &ndash; 106, to be exact. They're both rusty, but wanting to play some game other than racquetball. To throw Bashir off, O'Brien starts talking about the Carrington competition. Bashir calmly says any of the others would make a fine recipient, and still doesn't assert his worthiness. O'Brien continues his jabs, saying he would vote for Bashir, but that most other people would wonder who he is. Bashir then turns the tables, changing the conversation to Keiko's absence. Now, O'Brien can't hit the board.

Upon returning to his quarters that night, Quark finds Rom busy with several other Ferengi transforming the quarters. Rom explains that it will be the new headquarters of the [[Ferengi Benevolent Association]]. 

===Act Three===
Quark takes Rom into the other room by the ear, having enough of what's going on with Zek. Contrary to normal Ferengi values, the association seems to have been created for the same purpose its name implies: helping other people, free of charge. Rom insists Zek is a visionary and that the both of them are going to be central to his plan. Rom is excited about becoming a ""new kind"" of Ferengi, though he is not sure what that means at the moment. He continues to repeat concepts incomprehensible to Quark, then tells him they are both co-chairmen of the Association and will accompany Zek back to Ferenginar when he announces to the whole [[Ferengi Alliance]]. Now, Quark is alarmed as this will undoubtedly result in the three of them being killed by being pushed off of the top of the [[Tower of Commerce]] for the ideas. 

Finally, Quark takes Zek to Dr. Bashir, who examines the older Ferengi thoroughly but finds nothing wrong. Quark cannot believe it, and insists on more tests, even insulting him and bringing up the Carrington competition. He eventually relents, and Zek expresses his appreciation with a bar of [[latinum]], suggesting to donate it to charity if Bashir does not want to accept it. Interestingly, Zek mentions that he will be giving a gift to the [[Bajoran]] people that night at the [[Bajoran shrine]] as a ceremony, and hopes Bashir attends. He leaves, telling Quark there's a lot of needy people out there.

Quark and Rom sneak onto the Nagus' [[Zek's personal shuttle]] to find what the ""gift"" is. They're interrupted by Maihar'du, but, instead, he brings them into the shuttle. He reveals that the gift is a Bajoran [[Orb]].

===Act Four===
Quark tries to get some answers, but as vexed as Maihar'du is at Zek's behavior, he cannot say because of his [[vow of silence]]. Rom tries to look inside the Orb box, but Quark tries to wrestle it from him instead. It comes open in Quark's direction, and he has an odd [[orb experience]] in which he is taunted by Zek's figure about not understanding and being fearful. Afterwards, Quark learns that the new rules were a ""gift"" from the [[Prophet|Bajoran Prophets]] to Zek. He and Rom discover, through Zek's [[personal log]]s, that, as soon as he received the Orb from his contact on [[Cardassia III]], Zek headed for the [[Bajoran wormhole]], apparently intent on using the Prophets' ability to see the future for financial gain. Quark determines to go in himself and find out what happened.

Meanwhile, at the [[Replimat]], Bashir is busy on a [[PADD]]. Even [[Odo]] is caught up in the craze about the Carrington, and so comes to offer a ""revelation"" from a distant contact that Wade will not win the award, increasing the odds for the rest. Despite the fact he is apparently certain he is not going to win, Odo manages get Bashir to accidentally admit he's been working on an acceptance speech.

s inside the wormhole]]
Zek is at a terminal talking to a party who needs [[Kohlanese barley]], and is going out of his way to acquire some. He cuts off the transmission when Maihar'du, Quark and Rom come in, quickly [[kidnapping]] Zek and take him into the [[wormhole]] aboard his ship. Throughout the ordeal, oddly, he remains extremely pleasant and not disturbed at all.

===Act Five===
Once inside the wormhole, Quark opens the [[Orb of Wisdom]] (as Zek reveals it is called), instantly gaining the wormhole aliens' attention. The aliens inform Quark that they found Zek's goals to be ""adversarial"" and ""aggressive."" As a result, they ""restored"" Zek to a more peaceful state. Quark demands that they change Zek back, but the aliens decide to change him as well. However, Quark manages to convince them that doing so will only bring more Ferengi who will want to know what happened. He proposes that if they change Zek back, they will never have to speak with his people again. The Prophets agree and set Zek back to normal. Quark is very pleased when Zek states that he plans to sell the Orb of Wisdom to the Bajorans, and intends to make them pay a lot for it.

In the wardroom, people have gathered for the announcement of the Carrington Award recipient and everyone is disappointed to find that it has gone to [[Henri Roget]], someone who was never considered a serious contender. Although Bashir acts like he's not surprised, he admits to Dax even though he felt he wasn't going to win he's still disappointed he didn't.

Zek leaves the station, making sure that Quark and Rom have destroyed every last copy of the new Rules of Acquisition and will tell no-one that he donated to charity. Quark laments that despite going through a lot, he didn't manage to make some kind of profit. Rom admits to having made enough of a profit from both of them by embezzling from the Nagus. Quark congratulates him and says that this piece of theft would make [[Keldar|their father]] proud.

"
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0," ==Summary== ===Teaser=== [[Dr.]] [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]] is tending to [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]] in the [[Operations center|Ops]] pit. When O'Brien asks what happened, [[Commander]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] tells him that one of the [[plasma conduit]]s blew out while he was attempting to re-route a [[phase inducer]]. Bashir tells O'Brien that he has a mild case of [[radiation poisoning]], before injecting him with a [[dose]] of [[hyronalin]] to counter the effects. The doctor recommends O'Brien be placed on [[light duty]] for the next few days and Sisko agrees. Before they can discuss the matter further, [[Major]] [[Kira Nerys|Kira]] interrupts with news that a [[Romulan]] delegation has arrived and is requesting permission to dock. Sisko allows them to dock at [[Docking bay|Bay 12]]; he and Kira will meet them there. Before heading out, the Commander gives O'Brien one word of advice. ""''Light means light,''"" he says. Sisko doesn't want O'Brien spending the night crawling through [[Jefferies tube]]s looking for power surges. The chief jokingly replies, ""''You won't get any arguments today, Commander.''""  On the [[Promenade]], Kira and Sisko are on their way to meet the Romulan delegation when a drunken [[Klingon]] staggers out of [[Quark's]], assisted by two [[Bajoran]] security guards. [[Constable]] [[Odo]] explains that a [[Klingon 24th freighter 003|Klingon freighter]] had to dock with the station and, due to a [[computer]] error, will not be able to depart until it is repaired, which will take at least two more days. Sisko takes Odo aside and asks him to keep a close eye on the Klingons, as the commander doesn't want them to get in the way of the Romulans. Odo acknowledges Sisko's request and the drunken Klingon is taken to a holding cell.  Kira and Sisko continue to the docking port, where two [[Starfleet]] security guards are waiting. The circular doors are wheeled back and a Romulan named [[Ruwon]] steps out, followed closely by his aide, [[Karina]], and two guards. Sisko offers them accommodation after their long trip but all Ruwon is interested in are intelligence reports on the [[Dominion]]. The commander exchanges a brief glance with Kira, before escorting their guests to the [[wardroom]].  In his [[bar]], [[Quark]] is hanging up a [[dartboard]] for O'Brien, but he is skeptical it will bring him any profit. The chief confidently notes that ""''[[dart]]s and bars go together like [[bacon]] and [[egg]]s''"" to which Quark reminds him that people actually order bacon and eggs, and no-one has of yet asked to see a dartboard. In an attempt to convince, O'Brien hands Quark some darts and challenges him to hit the bulls-eye. Quark, unaware of how to play the game, throws them all at once, hitting [[Morn]] in the process. The [[Ferengi]] points out how dangerous the game is; after all, if one of his customers was injured, he could be held liable. But the chief doesn't give in and picks up a dart, intent on showing Quark how the game is properly played. As he aims for the board, there is a bright flash of light and he is transported to the upper level of the Promenade. But something isn't quite right. O'Brien looks across the way and sees himself, arguing with Quark about the damage the Klingons are doing to two of his [[holosuite]]s. Quark asks O'Brien that a maintenance crew be dispatched immediately. A confused look comes across his face as the other O'Brien tells Quark to keep the Klingons out of the holosuites from now on. Finishing his conversation, he turns away, and the two lock eyes, both incredibly confused by what is happening. But before they can say anything, the original O'Brien is back in Quark's. His dart hits the bulls-eye and he falls to the floor, disoriented.  ===Act One===  In the [[infirmary]], Doctor Bashir explains that the chief's earlier collapse was due to a sudden decrease in his serum [[calcium]] levels, a common side effect of the radiation poisoning, and gives him a dose of [[asinolyathin]] for the pain. The doctor continues to explain that his ""vision"" was also likely a mild side-effect, though the Chief isn't fully convinced. He explains it to Bashir, who jokingly mocks him, saying he has a ""sadly deficient fantasy life"". On that note, O'Brien sarcastically ""thanks"" the doctor for his help and leaves.  In the wardroom, Ruwon proclaims that the Dominion is the greatest threat the [[Alpha Quadrant]] has seen in the last century and wants to know exactly what Sisko and his crew have obtained through use of their [[cloaking device]] on the {{USS|Defiant|2370}}. When the commander admits they know very little of the Dominion, [[Karina]] responds, asking about Odo, incorrectly referring to him as a [[Founder]]. She believes he can tell them all they need to know about the Dominion, though Major Kira soon corrects her, informing her that Odo may be a [[Changeling]] but he is not a Founder and wants nothing to do with them. The commander backs her up by telling them it is the truth, ""''whether they chose to believe it or not''"". Ruwon reminds Sisko that they [[The Search, Part I (episode)|agreed to install]] the cloaking device in exchange for information on the Dominion, but they have received very little so far. He goes on to demand every piece of information [[Starfleet]] has on them no matter how insignificant, including any classified reports made to [[Starfleet Command]]. Sisko says he will have to clear it with his superiors first. On the upper level of the Promenade, Quark is complaining to O'Brien about the damage the Klingons have caused to the holosuites. In the middle of his sentence, O'Brien stops and, remembering his previous vision, looks across the way to where he was standing before. Another O'Brien is standing there, watching them. This time, Quark sees him too and observes that O'Brien currently has bigger problems than his holosuites. A few seconds later, the other O'Brien disappears.  In Sisko's office, [[Jadzia Dax]] reports that she did detect a minor [[temporal disturbance]] in Quark's, and another later on the Promenade, around about the same time O'Brien had his visions. It soon becomes apparent that O'Brien did travel to the future and then back again, to the same moment he left. Dax theorizes that the [[ion]]izing radiation he was exposed to earlier may have something to do with it and wants to examine Doctor Bashir's medical scans. Before she can explain further, the chief flashes back to Quark's in the middle of a bar fight and sees himself fighting with a Klingon. The future O'Brien is knocked to the ground, at which point another Klingon takes out his ''[[d'k tahg]]'' and heads towards him. O'Brien quickly grabs the Klingon's arm, knocking the dagger away and throwing him to the floor. Just as he avoids a bar stool being thrown at him, he flashes back to the commander's office, where he again collapses to the floor. Dax and Sisko quickly rush to his aid, but he doesn't respond; he is unconscious.  ===Act Two=== Back in the infirmary, Bashir has run a micro-cellular scan and has detected damage to O'Brien's [[cerebrospinal nerve cell]]s, which he thinks has been caused by the timeshifting. The doctor explains that while he can repair the current damage, the effect is cumulative and that there may come a time, if the timeshifting continues, when he can no longer repair the damage, and O'Brien could die. Sisko comforts him, saying Dax is using every scanner on the station to hunt for any temporal abnormalities, which is of some relief to O'Brien. ""''If anyone can find the cause of the timeshifts, it's Dax,''"" he says with a relaxed smile. The commander goes on to ask him if he was aware how far ahead the timeshifts are taking him, in case it affects the meeting with the Romulans, but he doesn't know. Sisko decides to ask Odo to increase security around Quark's Bar just in case.  At that moment, Major Kira walks in and, after asking how O'Brien is, she walks Commander Sisko onto the Promenade. As they pass a Bajoran stall, she explains that the Romulans want to debrief everyone who was on the ''Defiant'' when it was captured by the Founders and unrestricted access to the ship and all personal logs. Sisko immediately rejects access to personal logs, but decides to permit them limited access to the ship and allow debriefings of crew. He explains to Kira how the Romulans are completely dependent on them for information to which a frustrated Kira suggests they send one of their own ships through the [[Bajoran wormhole|wormhole]]. He continues to explain how the Romulans generally prefer to sit back and pull the strings from a distance if they can, and though Kira replies she is one puppet who doesn't like her strings pulled, she accepts his orders. As they part ways, Sisko reminds her to be diplomatic, to which she replies ""''I'm always diplomatic!''"". In the wardroom, Kira yells at the Romulans for insinuating she abandoned the ''Defiant'' prematurely during the battle with the [[Jem'Hadar]] but they only see her emotional outburst as evidence that they are correct in their assessment. Relaxing a little, she continues to explain how she was trapped in a hand-to-hand fight below decks and was knocked unconscious, before Odo put her on the shuttle. She says she only came to after they had left the ship and there was nothing they could have done. Ruwon begins to question why Odo didn't help any of the other crew but Kira defends him, insisting they were blocked in. Karina then asks her why she was in Odo's quarters before the attack and rather keenly suspects the Odo might be harboring feelings for Kira, which pushes Kira further over the edge. She puts an abrupt end to their questioning saying they can rip the cloaking device from the ''Defiant'' and advises them not to ask Odo the same questions or they may just find themselves on the other side of the bulkhead, floating home. Ruwom and Karina share a nervous glance as Kira storms out of the room, pushing the guards to one side.  In Quark's, Bashir has just beaten O'Brien in the tenth game of darts in a row. He tells the chief that because he has told them what happened he has changed the future, and with the increased security and Quark's promise not to let the Klingons in, the fight won't happen, though O'Brien isn't entirely convinced. Just then, three Klingons make their way down from the holosuites. The chief grabs Quark by his arm and demands an explanation as to why they are in the bar. Pulling out a bar of [[latinum]], he replies that the Klingons weren't in the bar, they were in the holosuites, and besides, they are paying him triple to use them. The three Klingons walk over to the two Romulans seated at a table and call them ""''filthy [[petaQ]]''"". Another suggests they ""''show them the way out.''"" Not ones to take insults, the two Romulans stand and begin confront their aggressors.  In the [[security office]], Kira is telling Odo what Ruwon said about them, which makes Odo feel slightly uncomfortable given that [[Heart of Stone (episode)|he does indeed have feelings for her]]. They are suddenly interrupted by a call from Quark; a fight has broken out in the bar. O'Brien gets into a fist fight with a Klingon, but using his knowledge manages to get the upper hand this time and knocks him to the floor. He then sees his younger self, who attacks another Klingon wieldying a ''d'k'tagh'' thereby fulfilling his second vision. As he warns his past self about the flying bar stool, Odo rushes in and breaks up the fight. But before O'Brien has a chance to recover, he is again flung into another future. This time, he appears in a corridor in the habitat ring where he sees his future self opening a panel. He calls out to him but before he can do anything a sharp bolt of energy is fired out from the panel, knocking his future self to the ground. The chief rushes to see if he's alright, but after feeling his pulse, he realizes he himself is dead.  O'Brien awakens in the infirmary where he was taken after the fight. Bashir tells him everything is OK and he's going to be alright, but O'Brien knows otherwise. ""''No, I'm not''"" he says, ""''In a few hours I'm going to be dead!''"".  ===Act Three=== Sisko, O'Brien, and Odo are in the corridor where the accident happened. The chief believes it was some sort of phaser or [[high-energy laser]] that killed his future self but a scan of the bulkhead reveals nothing. Odo carefully opens the panel but again there is nothing by the computer display inside. They theorize that the perpetrator has yet to plant the device but he will do so in the next few hours. Odo suggests placing a [[surveillance device]] in the corridor so they can observe if anyone does indeed try and tamper with the panel, at which point they are interrupted by Dax over the comm system. She wants Sisko and O'Brien to head up to Ops; she says she has found a clue as to the chief's timeshifting.  Up in Ops, Dax explained she tried several scans of the surrounding space but got nothing until she ran a scan on the lower [[subspace]] bandwidths with turned up some curious [[tetryon]] emissions. O'Brien remarks he hasn't seen emissions like that outside of a [[neutron star]]. Dax, however, suggests the presence of a [[quantum singularity]], the only strange thing is that it isn't affecting the [[gravimetric field]] signature of the station as it should. Sisko, assuming that a quantum singularity is responsible, turns to Bashir and asks how its effects can be combated. Bashir theorizes that the singularity is attracted to the [[delta-series radioisotope]]s in O'Brien's body, effectively pulling him along like a magnet. And if that's the case, he may have a cure for it, but it's going to take time. He warns the Chief that he could experience one or two more time jumps before the process has been completed. O'Brien wants to get started right away, and so heads down to the infirmary with Bashir. Meanwhile, Sisko orders Dax to continue to pinpoint the singularity in an effort to get rid of it. Just then, Major Kira enters Ops and informs the commander she had to move the Romulans to alternative quarters as the [[replicator]]s were malfunctioning. It just so happens that the quarters she has moved them to are on level 2, section [[47]], directly adjacent to the area where the future O'Brien was killed. Kira suggests moving them to a different room, but Sisko objects so as not to alert those responsible. Instead, he tells her to inform Odo and let the scenario play out before they make any further moves.  A short while later, Sisko is summoned to Odo's office where he informs him that someone has planted a class 3 surveillance device in the bulkhead, though he doesn't know who as they used a low energy [[transporter]] to put it there. Sisko calls it a delicate piece of transporter work. Odo goes on to say that although they cannot trace the transporter signal, he believes it originated from the station as there were no ships in range at the time. The Klingons are the prime suspects but Odo also intends to investigate the Bajorans, Quark, and the visiting [[Terellian]]s just to make sure. Sisko asks if Odo actually considers Quark a suspect, and Odo explains that he always investigates Quark as a matter of procedure. In Quark's, Bashir and O'Brien are waiting out the time he has until his death in the other future when Quark arrives with the drinks they ordered. Being his usual self, he also asks O'Brien to keep an eye out for the numbers on the [[dabo]] wheel next time he jumps into the future. O'Brien doesn't pay any attention to him and suggests he and Bashir leave. As they exit the upper level, O'Brien is again flung into the future, this time he is in the infirmary. He notices a body on one of the [[biobed]]s, covered in a white sheet. He slowly walks towards it and lifts the top to reveal his own corpse.  ===Act Four=== O'Brien covers up his dead body lying on the biobed when Bashir walks round the corner. He had been expecting him and has some important news for the chief to pass onto Bashir's past self. The radiation had damaged the [[basilar artery|basilar arteries]] in O'Brien's [[brain stem]] which hadn't shown up on any scans and was only picked up in the [[autopsy]]. Bashir instructs him to tell his former self to run a [[basilar arterial scan]] so he can detect and repair the damage in time. O'Brien begins to argue with Bashir about his inability to save him, but he flashes back to the upper level of the Promenade. O'Brien falls to the floor and Bashir summons a [[nurse]] and an emergency [[medkit]] there immediately. In the [[habitat ring]], Odo explains to Sisko that he was finally able to trace back the source of the transporter beam to some empty quarters. Sisko speculates that they brought in a [[portable transporter]] but Odo quickly discounts it as the technology is too bulky to be dragging around the halls. Sisko nods in agreement as Odo continues to explain how they modified the replicator, turning it into a mini-transporter by realigning the [[matter energy conversion matrix]]; a very sophisticated and professional job. Reaching into the replicator circuitry, Odo pulls out a device which he says is manufactured on [[Davlos III]], a planet on the Klingon border and which does ninety percent of its trade with the [[Klingon Empire]]. Sisko doesn't think it is enough to hold the Klingons and Odo agrees but there's more. A friend at [[Starfleet Intelligence]] that used to be assigned to the {{dis|Federation Embassy|Qo'noS}} on [[Qo'noS]] put him in contact with an old Klingon operative who provided him with information showing the three Klingons currently on the station are part of a covert strike force, reporting directly to the [[Klingon High Council|High Council]]. They now have enough to hold the Klingons for questioning, questioning that Odo feels can continue until after the Romulans have left the station. Sisko agrees though tells Odo to be careful, to which he replies, ""''There is no careful way to question a Klingon''.""  O'Brien is back in the infirmary where Bashir is scanning him. He wakes up and tells Bashir he needs to run the basilar arterial scan or he'll die within a few hours. ""''Well, who am I to argue with me''?"", Bashir jokes.  Meanwhile, Odo has arrested the three Klingon operatives: [[Bo'rak]], [[Atul]] and [[Morka]] and has placed them in a holding cell for the time being. He accuses them of being spies and saboteurs, to which they simply reply with threats of vengeance. Odo tries a threat of his own by telling them if they help him he will forgo telling the Klingon Intelligence service that they have been captured. He says from what he hears they frown on operatives who fail their missions. The Klingons look at each other thinking about his offer.  Back in Ops, Bashir informs Sisko that he has eliminated almost all of the radioisotopes from O'Brien's system and the last treatment is in a couple more hours, after which there should be no more timeshifting. Dax also reports that the quantum singularity is [[orbit]]ing the station in a roughly elliptical pattern. O'Brien continues by saying the anomaly radiates temporal energy at certain points in its orbit which seems to be causing his timeshifts. At that very moment, he shifts again. There are lots of people scrambling into a [[runabout]]. His future self is at the [[helm]] and initiates an [[emergency escape protocol]], disengaging the [[docking clamp]]s and immediately engaging full [[impulse]]. All three of the station's runabouts hastily escape the vicinity as explosions cascade across the habitat ring. The future O'Brien explains he was sleeping when an explosion rocked the station and was on his way to Ops when the [[evacuation alarm]] sounded, so got as many people as he could to the runabout before leaving. He tells O'Brien that doesn't know what happened or if the other senior staff made it off the station, and urges him to find out what happened and prevent it. As the runabout flies away, the explosions engulf the station, destroying it. At that point, the [[Bajoran wormhole|wormhole]] opens only to suddenly collapse an instant later. O'Brien watches the events in horror before he shifts. Back in Ops, Sisko asks the chief what's wrong. ""''We've got a new problem, sir''."" he replies.  ===Act Five=== Sisko questions O'Brien on his latest timeshift, asking for any clue of how the station may be destroyed. O'Brien says he noticed some explosions along the habitat ring but it all happened so fast that he couldn't get a clear sense of exactly what was going on. The commander orders a silent preparation for evacuation should it need to come to that, but he doesn't want to do anything that would alarm their enemy into attacking sooner. He also orders Dax to do a complete systems check on anything that could potentially cause this type of disaster. The chief also has an idea. If they could cause him to travel into the future on purpose, this time only by two or three hours, he may be able to find out what the threat is and stop it happening in their timeline. Bashir notes the problem with the plan; in order to do this, O'Brien's body would need to be flooded with Delta-series radioisotopes and prolonged exposure would kill him. But the chief knows the risks and is willing to do it if it means saving everyone on DS9. After thinking on it for a few seconds, Sisko approves his plan and they get to work. In the infirmary, Bashir instructs O'Brien on a rectangular device designed to inject him with a two [[rad]] dose of [[delta isotope]]s. He explains to him that the device is already calibrated for the return trip so all he has to do it press it again to return to the present. Bashir warns him that he cannot wait too long or his body will fail due to severe radiation poisoning. On another note, O'Brien mentions a message to [[Keiko O'Brien|Keiko]] that he has left in his quarters. He wants Bashir to deliver it should the plan fail. Bashir understands.  Upon activating the device, O'Brien is transported to his quarters where the future O'Brien is asleep. He manages to wake him and explains the situation. The two of them quickly head for Ops and on arrival a [[D'deridex DS9 001|Romulan warbird]] decloaks and opens fire on the station, taking out the [[shield generator]]s in the first shots. Kira orders return fire but it is no use, the Romulans have hit the [[power core]]. The future O'Brien realizes the orbiting quantum singularity was the power source of the Romulan ship and tells O'Brien to go back and stop it. But he can't. The radiation poisoning has taken its toll on his body and he would die if he did, and would then be unable to warn the crew. Instead he takes off the device and hands it to future O'Brien, convincing him to go back in his place.  The new O'Brien wakes up in the infirmary next to Doctor Bashir, who asks how it went. After confirming it worked, O'Brien immediately contacts Sisko in Ops, who raises the station's shields and readies weapons. Bashir quickly realizes that this O'Brien is different; he doesn't have nearly as many delta isotopes in his body and his metabolic readings are completely different. In the wardroom, the Romulans are interviewing Quark, when Sisko, Kira and Odo barge in. The commander tells him to leave before revealing what he knows to Ruwon and Karina. He tells Ruwon how he remembered what he said about the Dominion being the greatest threat to the Alpha Quadrant for a century and that if he truly believed that he would want to close the wormhole for good. Kira finishes by saying that the Federation and Bajor wouldn't just stand by and watch them do it so they would have to destroy the station as well and make it look like an accident. The two Romulans deny the allegations calling it a mere ""theory"". But Sisko responds by informing them he has about fifty [[photon torpedo]]es locked onto their ship. He then asks Odo to escort their ""guests"" to the nearest transporter room.  In Quark's, over darts, O'Brien tells Bashir how weird it is to be living in the past, that it is like living the other O'Brien's life. Bashir says that he's the same O'Brien, just with a few extra memories. As he leaves, he whispers in Quark's [[lobe]], ""''dabo''."" Quark doesn't understand what O'Brien means until a small crowd at the wheel yells, ""''Dabo!''"" Quark then yells for O'Brien to come back, who simply walks away, laughing.   "

== Plot ==
A young runaway named [[Mary Jo]] (Patricia Arquette) lives and works on a desolate farm under the watchful eyes of [[George Yates|George]] (Chelcie Ross) and [[Luisa Yates|Luisa Yates]] (Susan Blommaert). Some time ago, George caught Mary Jo robbing a store in town and has been blackmailing her to work for them ever since. She is regularly abused by the Yates; if Luisa -- who walks with a leg brace -- isn't beating her with a cane, George is usually sexually harassing her. 

One day, George spies on Mary Jo as she collects eggs. He later orders her to milk the cow, then watches her with erotic thoughts. He sneaks up on her “looking to talk” but she throws the milk bucket at him in self-defense. He threatens her once again with his blackmail, but she pushes him to call the police as she’d rather live anywhere else. George grabs the screaming Mary Jo and smashes a bottle over her head, leaving her with a nasty head wound. Luisa comes looking for Mary Jo after hearing the scream, so George covers the unconscious girl with hay. While he sloppily lies to Luisa about what happened, Mary Jo wakes up and runs out to the cornfield. She falls down in front of a clown-faced scarecrow and imagines it briefly coming to life before passing out again. The Yates find her and wake her up; she begins rambling about “her man” and how much she wants him to make love to her. George insists the head injury made her crazy, but Luisa is suspicious.   

A few nights later, Mary Jo makes dinner while George once again harasses her. She rebuffs him and talks about her man, leading a frustrated George to tell her nobody’s around for 60 miles. She claims her mystery man will come and make love to her; Luisa, aware of her husband’s advances, angrily chases Mary Jo out of the kitchen. The two realize they have “free help“ for a lifetime, deducing that nobody else will take care of a crazy girl. This excites George, a moment that does not go unnoticed by Luisa. Later that night, George wakes up after having a wet dream of Mary Jo — he looks out the window and sees the giddy girl heading into the cornfield. He follows her to the scarecrow and watches her talk to it. Believing she has no concept of reality, he tries making a pass on her. She rejects him again; he angrily insists the scarecrow isn’t real and that he is “flesh and blood”, causing Mary Jo to run off. When he returns to the house, Luisa asks where he’s been. He claims to have been chasing a trespassing critter — Luisa spots Mary Jo outside happily dancing around. She calls George a fool and goes back to sleep.    

Mary Jo wears a dress around the farm the next day. She informs George she has another date with her man at midnight, getting him aroused. That night, Luisa threatens to do “the same thing you do to bulls when you want them to be steers” if she ever catches George cheating on her. After falling asleep, George dreams of making love to Mary Jo when suddenly she changes to Luisa — he wakes up and steps out of the bedroom.    

Midnight strikes. Mary Jo heads into the cornfield and starts fondling the scarecrow, whose eyes suddenly open. When he wraps his arms around her, she happily proclaims “You’re truly alive!” and kisses him. As the two get passionate, Luisa angrily approaches them; the scarecrow goes back onto the pole and becomes stationery, causing Mary Jo to plead “Don’t leave me!“ Luisa demands to know where George is; Mary Jo claims nobody except she and “her man” are out here. Finally pushed to her breaking point, Luisa insists the scarecrow isn’t real and proves her point by stabbing it repeatedly with a rake. Blood trickles from the scarecrow — it falls to the ground and the clown mask falls off, revealing it to actually be George. She stands over his lifeless body and calls him a fool one last time before Mary Jo fatally stabs her in the back with the rake. Now with a confident look in her eyes, Mary Jo grabs the key to the farm’s only working car off George’s neck and runs off singing about being “free at last”.

Following a [[magnetic wave survey]] of the [[Parvenium system]], we have detected an object which we cannot immediately identify.""''  As the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-D|-D}} encounters an unknown space probe; it emits a low level [[nucleonic beam]] at [[Captain]] [[Jean-Luc Picard]], who is standing on the [[bridge]] looking at it through the [[viewscreen]]. Picard faints, and [[Commander]] [[William T. Riker|Riker]] catches him, assuring the captain that he is safe. Medical assistance is summoned. Captain Picard soon awakens with a strange woman tending to him and calling him ""[[Kamin]]"".  === Act One === Picard quickly learns that he is not on a [[holodeck]] simulation; in fact, he is no longer on the ''Enterprise'', and nobody has even heard of the ''Enterprise''. Picard demands to know what is going on and why he has been brought to this place, inquiring to the woman if he is a prisoner here. Disoriented, Picard goes outside, despite the woman's protestations that he shouldn't leave. In a town square, he meets a councilman, [[Batai]], who is giving a speech to the other citizens, telling them that a sapling [[tree]] which has been recently planted is an affirmation of life, in defiance of the [[drought]] they are currently facing, with expectations of a long life. Batai tells the others that they will strive to keep it alive, as a symbol of their survival. After the villagers applaud, Picard walks over to Batai, who seems to know him and appears to be a friend. He confusingly explains to him, when Picard presses him, that the woman he was speaking to earlier is his wife [[Eline]], the community is named [[Ressik]], and the planet is [[Kataan]]. He leaves Batai to walk around the community, convincing himself it's not a dream.   He arrives back ""home"" at night to a worried Eline, and discovers more about this ""new"" existence. He is an [[iron weaver]] who enjoys playing his [[Ressikan flute|flute]], which he has never been able to master. Picard also learns that the world has never made contact with any alien species. Eline tries to convince him to come to bed, but then Picard sees her necklace, a miniature version of the probe he saw while on the ''Enterprise''. She says Kamin gave it to her, his first gift he ever gave her.  Although hours have passed for Picard, only a couple of seconds have passed back on the ''Enterprise''. Riker calls [[sickbay]] for help, as Picard has fallen into a [[coma]].  === Act Two === Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]] arrives with [[Alyssa Ogawa|Ogawa]] and [[Martinez]] and discovers Picard is undergoing tremendous neurological activity &ndash; his [[neurotransmitter]] levels are off the scale. It seems the alien probe has locked itself onto Picard. [[Worf]] advises destroying the probe and announces to Riker that he has [[phaser]]s locked onto it, ready to fire on his order. Dr. Crusher advises Riker against destroying the probe as the captain may be injured, so they decide to wait.   Meanwhile, five years have passed on Kataan, and ""Kamin"" has become integrated into his new society, though has not let go of his past life. He suggests to the [[Kataan administrator 001|visiting administrator]] that [[atmospheric condenser]]s are needed to survive the extended drought they are currently experiencing. His ideas are rejected, but Batai notes that it is the first time Kamin has spoken as a member of the community in years. He tells Kamin that it was good to hear that again. Later that evening, Batai and Kamin sit outside while Kamin plays ""[[Frère Jacques]]"" on his flute.   After Eline asks Batai to leave for his home, Kamin asks Eline for permission to build something. Eline says that Kamin does not need her permission, to which Kamin responds that in this case, he does: he wishes to build a nursery, Eline is briefly taken aback, but the two then begin to plan for a family, starting with the construction of the nursery.  Back on the ''Enterprise'', [[Geordi La Forge]] has launched a probe to follow the alien probe's [[ion trail]] back to its source. [[Data]] has determined a method of disrupting the beam, and they make plans to implement Data's idea and cut the connection to Picard.  === Act Three === Once again, several years have passed on Kataan. Kamin and Eline are in the middle of a ""naming ceremony"" for their second child, named {{dis|Batai|Kamin's son}} (after their late friend, who had passed on a year before). Viewing his children, Kamin tells Eline that he cannot believe how quickly they are growing up, noting that it seems like only yesterday that his daughter [[Meribor]] had her naming ceremony. He confides to his wife that in the past, he never thought he needed children to complete his life. Now, however, he cannot imagine living his life without them. As the reception begins, Kamin suddenly collapses and Eline asks for a doctor to come immediately. On the ''Enterprise'', Ogawa finds Picard is suffering [[somatophysical failure]] with the connection cut. Dr. Crusher tries in vain to save Picard with [[delactovine]] and [[cardiac induction]], but he needs the beam back. Data reestablishes it, thereby stabilizing Picard's condition.  Ten years have passed on Kataan, and Kamin, together with his now adult daughter Meribor, have found that the [[soil]] in their yard is simply dead. The sun's [[radiation]] has sterilized the dirt making it incapable of supporting life, a process that is implied to be wiping out all plant life on the planet. Kamin jokingly tells her that he should have filled her mind with trivial things like games, toys, and clothes instead of devoting so much time to scientific study of things she can't change. He mentions [[Dannick]], a man who is in love with her. Meribor ominously says she believes she should marry him sooner rather than later, and Kamin agrees that she should live for the present and make now the most precious time.   La Forge has managed to trace the alien probe's path back to the unmapped [[Kataan star system]] in the [[Silarian sector]]. It contains no habitable planets as the [[star]] went [[nova]] approximately one thousand years earlier.  === Act Four === Many more years have passed on Kataan, and Kamin is visibly elderly and now on the council himself. Using his [[telescope]], he has discovered that the drought will continue indefinitely, and the planet may be doomed. Eline comes and encourages Batai to tell him he wants to concentrate on his music instead of school. Kamin is startled, but ultimately accepts his decision, musing after he leaves that there may not be much time to follow any dream.  The next day, he argues with the government administrator, who tells him in confidence that the government [[scientist]]s had come to the same conclusion that he has two years earlier. Kamin pleads with him that an evacuation, even of a handful of people, must be attempted, but the pained administrator points out to Kamin that they simply do not have the technological capability for spaceflight of that magnitude, having only recently started launching small unmanned missiles into orbit. Reluctantly, the administrator shares with Kamin that there is an effort underway to save ""some"" piece of the [[Kataan native|Kataan civilization]], though he will reveal no more about it. Kamin's son Batai arrives and informs him that something is wrong with his wife Eline, and the pair rush home. Shortly afterward, Eline dies a natural death, and Kamin grieves over her body.  === Act Five === Years later, a very elderly Kamin is playing with his grandchild, Meribor's son, [[Kamie]]. He laments that his grandson deserves a long and full life, but like the rest of their world, he will not survive. Kamin reluctantly goes along with the pair to join everyone in the community to view ""the launching"", which only he seems not to know about. Kamin asks, ""''What is it they're launching?''""  His daughter, Meribor: ""''You know about it, father. You've already seen it.''""  ""''Seen it?  What are you talking about? I haven't seen any missile.''""  Batai: ""''Yes, you have, old friend. Don't you remember?''""  Kamin turns to see his old friend, Batai, but in the prime of his life. Batai explains, ""''You saw it just before you came here. We hoped our probe would encounter someone in the future &ndash; someone who could be a teacher, someone who could tell the others about us''.""  ""''Oh&hellip; oh, it's me&hellip; isn't it? I'm the someone. I'm the one it finds. That's what this launching is &ndash; a probe that finds me in the future!''""  ""''Yes, my love&hellip;''""   Stunned, Kamin turns and sees Eline, glowing in youthful beauty, with the rest of his family. She says, ""''The rest of us have been gone a thousand years. If you remember what we were &ndash; and how we lived &ndash; then we'll have found life again.''""  ""''Eline&hellip;''""  As the missile launches&hellip;  ""''Now we live in you. Tell them of us&hellip; my darling&hellip;'""  Picard regains consciousness on the bridge of the ''Enterprise'' as the alien probe breaks contact by ceasing its beam. After the initial disorientation, he discovers that he has lived decades in the course of twenty to twenty-five real-time minutes. Riker orders the probe brought into a [[shuttlebay]] with a [[tractor beam]] on board the ship for further study. As Picard approaches the entrance to the turbolift to accompany Dr. Crusher to sickbay, he instinctively raises his right hand to touch the door mechanism he remembers from Ressik.   Later in his [[quarters]], as Picard slowly attempts to adjust back into his real life, Riker reports that the probe has completely shut down as it was clearly designed to do. He then delivers to Picard a small box found inside the alien probe. Picard opens the box to find the flute which he still vividly remembers from his life as Kamin. Picard glances at Riker and he leaves his quarters so he can be alone. Picard, full of emotion, holds the flute close to his chest and begins to play the tune he had played at his ""son's"" naming ceremony.  "
0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"==Plot== [[Bender]] grows concerned that he will be doomed to obscurity, and sets off to rectify the situation. One of these schemes includes spraying graffiti on the side of a building, saying ""Bender Lives Large And Kicks Butt."" The building is demolished, and his phrase is reduced to ""Bender Licks Butt"". Bender returns the [[Planet Express Building]] to find out that the [[Planet Express Crew|crew]] has staged a ""funeral"" for him, but it ends badly. The [[Professor]] assigns the crew a new mission: deliver a giant sandstone block to the [[planet]] [[O'Cyris IV]].  Upon their arrival, they find a desert world whose society is modeled after ancient [[Egypt]] and who they claim introduced interstellar travel to them. The crew is enslaved to work on the building of the funeral pyramid of [[Pharaoh Hermenthotip]]. Their job is to work alongside the other slaves, moving heavy stone blocks manually. Bender, impressed by the [[Osirin]] Pharaohs' method of ensuring their place in history, becomes a workaholic, working so fast the slave drivers can't even keep up with him.  Pharaoh Hermenthotip arrives to inspect his newly completed pyramid; and just as he was about to set everyone free, he is killed when the nose falls off a giant statue of himself. The priests entomb Hermenthotip, and he is remembered in [[Pharaoh's Funeral Song|song]], and the next day they consult their [[Wall of Prophecy]] to select the new pharaoh. While the slaves partied over their few hours of freedom, Bender sneaks out and makes a few surreptitious modifications to the wall, therefore, the wall declares him the new pharaoh.  Newly crowned Pharaoh Bender demands a statue of himself, one billion cubits tall, so that he will be remembered forever. Construction proceeds, with Bender quickly establishing himself as an excessively dictatorial and ruthless pharaoh, and the massive statue is soon completed. Nonetheless, when it is unveiled, Pharaoh Bender announces that he is displeased with it, and wants it to be torn down and rebuilt. The high priests, disgusted and tired with Bender, wrap him for burial, and toss him into the tomb, along with [[Fry]] and [[Leela]] at Bender's request.  Fry and Leela want to blast their way out using the explosive Schnapps from the tomb's distillery; but Bender objects, worried that he won't be remembered if the statue is destroyed. Fry and Leela make a show of not remembering Bender, and he relents. After blasting a crack in the statue's foot, Fry, Leela, and Bender escape and run back to the [[Planet Express ship]]. As the ship departs from O'Cyris IV, the statue explodes in a gigantic fireball. Bender is distraught, but Leela consoles him with the knowledge that his reign of terror will be remembered longer than any statue. Satisfied, Bender tells the crew to set course for [[Earth]]. As the ship approaches an Earth-like planet, Bender begins to laugh evilly. Leela points out that the planet isn't Earth and Bender stops laughing. The ship flies away from the planet, ostensibly towards Earth.  "

{{log entry|Captain's log, USS Enterprise (NCC-1701), 2269|Captain's log]], [[stardate]] 4978.5. We are approaching the [[Arcadian star system]] on a mission to locate an old friend.}}

Upon the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701}}'s arrival at the planet [[Motherlode]], [[Captain]] [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]] asks [[Spock]] what the odds are of [[Harcourt Fenton Mudd|Harry Mudd]]'s presence on the planet. Spock tells the captain that the odds of him being on the surface are approximately eighty-one percent, plus or minus .53. ""''Why can't you just say ""Mudd's probably there?""''"" [[Dr.]] [[Leonard McCoy|McCoy]] asks. ""''I just did, doctor,''"" Spock replies. [[Lieutenant]] [[Arex]] reports that the ''Enterprise'' has entered parking [[orbit]] of the planet. Kirk beams down to Motherlode with Spock, and after locating Mudd, Kirk tells him that he's wanted for fraud, illegal drug manufacturing and swindling. For proof Mudd demonstrates the potion on a woman who [[Spock]] discovers to actually be a reptilian illusion created by a [[Rigellian hypnoid]]. Angered by this, the [[miner]]s begin to attack Mudd, but he is once again rescued by the ''Enterprise'' [[crew]], apprehended, and incarcerated. Mudd blames Kirk for ruining his scheme on Motherlode and sues him, in which Kirk reluctantly complies.

Aboard the [[starship|ship]], Spock requests a medical report from [[Nurse]] [[Christine Chapel|Chapel]]. Mudd, imprisioned in the [[brig]], sees that she is enamored of him but he is ""''a trifle lacking in the warmer emotions.''"" He then proceeds to convince Chapel to try the potion on Spock. When Chapel thinks that the potion does not actually work, she becomes bitter and seeks out Mudd. Without warning, the potion begins to take an effect on Spock. He had '''''no''''' immunity to its effects; it simply took somewhat longer to affect a [[Vulcan]], and as he hands over his report with her summary appended he says, ""''Ahh. Nurse Chapel's sweet summary. Dear, lovely, Christine.''"" During a fight between Mudd and Chapel, love crystals are broken near an air vent in the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s [[shuttlebay]] and permeate throughout the ship. It begins to affect the entire crew. Mudd captures Chapel and escapes to a rocky planet in a stolen [[shuttlecraft]]. The love-stricken Spock becomes so enamored with his beloved Nurse Chapel that he will do anything to rescue her. Spock wants to lead a [[landing party]] and he tells Kirk, ""''Captain, I insist upon going. Christine, I can't stand the thought of any danger to her. The woman I love.''"" Kirk exclaims, ""''Love, Spock?''"" Spock replies, ""''Yes, captain. I want to protect her. Hold her in my arms.''"" Spock seems to be utterly unstoppable.

{{log entry|Captain's log, supplemental. Harry Mudd has escaped from the ''Enterprise'' taking Head Nurse Chapel with him, apparently as a hostage. Meanwhile, Mr. Spock is acting very strange.}}

Spock says, ""''Come on, hurry. If he's harmed one hair on her pretty head...''"" Kirk accompanies Spock but they are attacked on the planet by [[rock beast]]s. Spock asks Chapel, ""''Darling. Are you all right?''"" Chapel questions, ""''Darling? How wonderful.''"" Unable to transport to the vessel because of the potion's affect on the crew, Kirk asks Spock, ""''Can't you take your hands off her?''"" Spock replies, ""''That's my affair. Jim. No, captain. We're both reacting to the drug. The love potion.''"" 

On the ship in [[sickbay]], McCoy is flirting with a crew woman and says, ""''Did I ever tell you about the time I saved Captain Kirk's life? Or Spock's? And my dear friend Scotty? And that pretty little [[Lieutenant]] [[Nyota Uhura|Uhura]]. I've saved just about everybody on this here ship. If the ''Enterprise'' had a [[heart]], I'd save her too. Oh, let's talk about your heart, my dear.''""

When Kirk thinks he can distract the beasts Spock tells him, ""''That is an outstandingly stupid idea! Ah, I'm sorry. The [[drug]]. I simply doubt that we can appeal to their better nature, if they have one.''"" Kirk, though, uses the crystals to make the beasts become docile and loving. Eventually the potion wears off and the crew beams everyone back to the ship, but then the chemical proves to have rebound after-effects that cause hatred and animosity among the crew. 

Mudd is placed back in the brig, where he confesses to other con jobs. When Spock then asks Chapel if he can help her to record Harry Mudd's confession, she adamantly repulses him. Spock comments, ""''A few moments of love paid for with several hours of hatred. Your potion is scarcely a bargain, Harry.''"" Spock then assures Mudd he will get [[rehabilitation]] therapy for his crimes. Mudd laughingly answers, ""''I just hate to leave you all, all my loved ones.''""

Charlene cheerily tells the children to get along. Politely, Jeffrey apologizes to Belle, who concedes that it is Jeffrey's turn. Charlene seems excited and the three of them stand at attention as the man of the house approaches.  [[The Doctor]] turns a corner, a cup of [[coffee]] in one hand and a briefcase in the other, and compliments Charlene on the quality of the coffee. Charlene tells him she [[Replicator|replicated]] a new blend from [[Paksor III]] and she seems pleased to hear he enjoyed it. The Doctor kisses her on the cheek and informs her he will be home at the usual time. Everything seems to be in order as Charlene reminds her husband not to overwork himself, Jeffrey promises to have his [[homework]] done by the time The Doctor returns from work, and Belle assures The Doctor she will receive an A on her [[history]] test. She adds that she'd like to do some [[algebra]] problems with him if he has the time. Finally, Charlene reminds The Doctor to invite some of his friends from work for dinner, as she wants to meet them before she and the children say goodbye to The Doctor.  In [[sickbay]], [[Kes]] stands at a terminal as The Doctor materializes, a satisfied look upon his face. Kes asks what The Doctor's new holo-family is like, and he confidently informs her it is everything he could have hoped for.  ===Act One=== :""''[[Captain]]'s log, [[stardate]] 50836.2. We're had long-range communications with a seemingly friendly race known as the [[Vostigye]]. We'll be rendezvousing within the hour at one of their [[space station]]s.''""  When {{USS|Voyager}} reaches the rendezvous where it was scheduled to meet with the Vostigye, the [[crew]] finds nothing but debris and all sixty Vostigye [[scientist]]s appear to have died. There is evidence of energy discharges, although it is possible the assailants used non-traditional [[weapon]]s. [[Ensign]] [[Harry Kim|Kim]] notes a strange [[subspace]] signal leading away from the station, so Captain [[Kathryn Janeway|Janeway]] decides to follow it.  The Doctor sits in [[sickbay]] with {{Lieutenant}} [[B'Elanna Torres|Torres]], who has just performed a diagnostic to ensure that his recent tinkering with his program doesn't interfere with his systems. The Doctor and Kes tell Torres of his new holographic family, which he found surprisingly easy to manage despite what he has heard about families being difficult. Both Torres and Kes express interest in meeting his new family, so he invites them over for dinner.  At dinner, Charlene informs Torres and Kes that she took a course in continental cuisine so she could replicate new and interesting foods for [[Kenneth]] (The Doctor's name in the program). Kes tries to be polite and goes along with the program, but Torres grows increasingly impatient as the conversation continues. When Charlene, Belle, and Jeffrey cheerily describe Kenneth as the best husband and father in the [[quadrant]], Torres stops the program. The Doctor is confused, as he sees nothing wrong with the program, but Torres informs him that his family is nothing like a real family. Describing The Doctor's wife and children as ""lollipops,"" she explains that he won't learn anything from spending time in a fantasy world with a perfect family. However, she offers to help him make them more realistic.   Meanwhile, [[Tom Paris]] announces that the signal ''Voyager'' has been following has thinned out. There are no signs of [[starship]]s or [[life sign]]s, but there is an increasingly large [[subspace]] disruption, so Janeway puts the ship on [[red alert]]. A massive energy wave anomaly emerges from subspace as ''Voyager'' attempts to back away.  ===Act Two=== The anomaly emits some sort of [[shock wave]] and bears down on ''Voyager'' as Paris announces that the ship's [[impulse drive|engines]] have failed. Janeway and the rest of the crew brace for impact and arm the ship's [[phaser]]s only to see the anomaly disappear seconds later. The crew is in shock until [[Commander]] [[Chakotay]] speaks up. ""''I'm not afraid to say it, I've never seen anything like that before.''"" Once the anomaly has dissipated, Janeway decides to investigate it further. Chakotay informs her that according to his readings it was an [[astral eddy]] that formed at the confluence of space and subspace. Ensign Kim finds that the eddy was highly charged with plasma, so as well as being a scientific curiosity if the energy could be harnessed it would also go quite a way to relieving their power shortages. They prepare to anticipate the next such occurrence.  Back in sickbay, Kes seems cautious about the randomized behavioral [[algorithm]]s that Torres has added to The Doctor's family program. However, he doesn't anticipate any problems he can't handle, as he has been programmed with a full [[database]] of [[pediatrics|pediatric]] care and childhood development and has experience with ""romantic relationships."" He is due home for dinner shortly and transfers himself to the [[holodeck]].   Upon entering his [[holographic]] home, The Doctor finds his home disorganized with things lying around everywhere, no one to greet him at the door, and a strange series of bangs and other sounds that distantly resemble [[music]] coming from elsewhere in the house. Charlene is in a hurry to go somewhere and seems less than interested in his usual stories about his day at work. She is set to speak at the [[Bolian]] [[embassy]], and he learns that it is his turn to cook. Belle yells from her room that she can't find her mallet, and Charlene tells her she would have better luck if she cleaned her room. After Charlene leaves, The Doctor attempts to be reasonable with Belle, explaining she would know where it was if she put it in her closet. She whines as she searches the house frantically, late for practice, but they can agree that the music is too loud. The Doctor tells Jeffrey to turn it off, and he all but ignores his father. Two [[Klingon]] adolescents, {{dis|Larg|hologram}} and [[K'Kath]], knock on the door and rudely ask where Jeffrey is; when The Doctor tells them Jeffrey is doing homework and can't see friends, Jeffrey emerges and says something to Larg and K'Kath in [[Klingonese]]. They simply walk past The Doctor while he attempts to deal with the temperamental Belle.  ===Act Three=== Paris is in the [[mess hall]], looking for food. [[Neelix]] asks if Paris wants any food, but Paris complains about Neelix making the same casserole four days in a row. When Neelix suggests that Paris use the [[replicator]], Paris admits that he's out of rations. Neelix dishes him a plate of the casserole.  Paris goes over to sit next to Torres, who is reading a book on a [[PADD]], saying ""''a beautiful woman should never eat alone''."" He asks what she is reading, and she tries to hide the PADD, saying it's ""nothing"", but Paris manages to grab it and begins reading aloud. The book is a Klingon [[romance novel]] called ''[[Women Warriors at the River of Blood]]''. In the ensuing conversation, Paris and Torres speak about the Klingon romantic side. The conversation is filled with double entendres and innuendo. Tom borrows the book, saying ""''Maybe it'll give me some ideas of how to make ''your'' heart quicken.''""  Another anomaly appears, and Captain Janeway calls senior officers to the [[bridge]].  Paris and Torres exit the [[turbolift]] onto the bridge. Captain Janeway asks Paris if he can get the ship close enough to the anomaly to send a probe in. The ship gets a bit of a rough ride. Paris apologizes, saying he's trying to find a way to ride out the graviton waves.  [[Tuvok]] launches the probe. When the probe hits the anomaly, the ship is shaken worse than before. Paris says that it's kind of fun. Torres disagrees. They begin to receive telemetry from the probe. The anomaly has an interior temperature of nine million [[Kelvin]], exchanges matter between [[subspace]] and normal space, and has a perfectly calm eye in the center. Janeway and Torres talk about trying to transport some of the anomaly onto the ship, but the anomaly disappears, taking the probe with it. The probe is still transmitting, and Torres detects some sort of energy, neither in space nor subspace. They then discuss not taking energy from the anomaly, but from its waste. It is decided that ''Voyager''{{'}}s energy output is too great and would corrupt the [[plasma]]. Paris suggests taking a shuttle. Torres points out that Paris will be exposing himself to [[radiation]]. Captain Janeway orders Paris to report to sickbay before departing.  After injecting Paris with something to provide him with temporary protection from the [[astral eddy]], the talk turns to The Doctor's family. He informs Paris that he has analyzed the situation and come up with a solution. Paris urges caution: a family is not something that can be ""fixed"" like a sick patient.  The Doctor's plan is to call a family meeting and to dictate new ground rules to each of its members, so that the family will function more harmoniously. The new rules include shifting the schedules of the activities of his wife and daughter, and forbidding his son to see his Klingon friends. Everyone objects to this plan. His wife objects that she was not consulted beforehand and seems to have no input over the family's direction. His daughter objects to a sports team demotion that will be necessitated by the new schedule. His son objects that it is not his father's place to dictate to him what friends he will and will not have &ndash; a point on which his mother agrees. It's also clear that The Doctor has designed the changes in such a way that he alone would be allowed to continue without making any new sacrifices. The meeting collapses, with everyone going their separate ways, and The Doctor has less respect from his family than before. His daughter, however, takes the time to tell him that she still loves him, even if he has made a mess of things.  Meanwhile, Paris, inside a shuttlecraft, begins exploring the eddy. He encounters turbulence, and is pulled inside. When the eddy disappears from normal space, so does Paris and the shuttle.  ===Act Four=== ''Voyager'' manages to regain contact with the shuttle. Paris is unhurt, but he doesn't know where he and the shuttle have been sent.  In sickbay, Kes persuades The Doctor to take the rest of the day off and to 'go home early' to see to the needs of his family. He interrupts his son and his two Klingon friends in the living room. While they pretend otherwise, it is clear that the boys are planning to use a Klingon dagger called a ''[[kut'luch]]'', to begin a ceremony involving violence and bloodletting, in preparation for becoming a warrior. Jeffrey's Klingon friends are ordered to leave the family's house, but The Doctor is unable to prevent the situation with his son from escalating. Jeffrey is disgusted with his father's value system and with that of Humanity in general; he intends to become a warrior, and adopt the Klingon way of life. When The Doctor states that Jeffrey needs to live by his father's rules as long as Jeffrey continues living in his father's house, Jeffrey replies, ""Then I won't live here,"" and leaves.  Immediately after this incident, The Doctor is contacted by his wife. Their daughter has been injured during a [[parrises squares]] competition.  At the hospital, The Doctor explains the situation to his wife. Their daughter has suffered severe brain trauma. Despite operating on her for three hours, The Doctor and a colleague are unable to reverse the damage. Charlene won't accept that there is nothing more that can be done. Charlene leaves to get a second opinion. Unable to face the pain involved in Belle's impending death, The Doctor stops the program.  ===Act Five=== Meanwhile, Paris and the ''Voyager'' crew determine that Paris' shuttle has been sent to an ""interfold layer between space and subspace."" Paris and the bridge crew are able to conceive and execute a plan in which Paris rides the eddy back into normal space, where he can be rescued. The shuttle's hull is ruptured and ''Voyager'' is damaged by debris along the plasma wave but they manage to rescue an injured Paris and beam him directly to sickbay.  As he is treating Paris in sickbay, The Doctor complains bitterly about people who love to take risks regardless of the danger. Paris can see he is upset and The Doctor tells him about his daughter's injury. The Doctor informs the rescued Paris that he, The Doctor, won't be returning to his holodeck family, stating that he couldn't face it. Paris replies that he and the other crewmembers would avoid that kind of pain (of a loved one dying) if they could, but that in real life, they do not have much choice or control over such things.   When The Doctor replies that fortunately, he does have the ability to make such choices, Paris asks him whether that really is such a fortunate thing; he goes on to say that The Doctor created the program so he could experience what it's like to have a family &ndash; to experience the good times ''and'' bad; however, one cannot have one without the other. Paris points out everyone on ''Voyager'' left people behind when they got stranded in the [[Delta Quadrant]], and that everyone has suffered a loss. But, they have found support and friendship with each other, and have become a family, in part because of the pain they have shared.   Paris continues by telling The Doctor that if he turns his back on this program, he'll always be stuck at this point; he'll never have the chance to say goodbye to his daughter, or be there for his wife and son when they need him... and he'll be cheating himself of the chance to have their love and support. In the long run, says Paris, The Doctor will miss the whole point of what it means to have a family.  With this new perspective, The Doctor re-enters the program as his daughter is dying, providing what comfort and calm that he can for her. His wife returns and joins them. Then his son comes in, without his Klingon jewelry, bringing his sister her security blanket from home. The four continue talking until Belle dies. The wife breaks down sobbing, and the son tries to comfort her. The Doctor stands back for a moment, then he and his remaining family members draw closer to one another in their grief.  "
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"==Summary== ===Teaser=== [[Data]] and [[Geordi La Forge]] are enjoying a [[Sherlock Holmes]] mystery [[holodeck]] program. However, when Data tries to prove the guilt of the alleged murderer by throwing a matchbox at him which he catches with his right hand, Data is puzzled as the program should have rendered the character [[left handed]], which would have conclusively proved Data's accusation. La Forge, agreeing this seems like a malfunction, freezes the program and calls for [[Reginald Barclay]], asking him to come down and examine the program, as this certainly was not the first time something went wrong with it. After saving the program, Data and La Forge run into Barclay outside the holodeck. Barclay thinks it might have been a glitch in the [[matrix diode]]s and assures them he will solve the problem.   While performing a diagnostic on all files concerning Sherlock Holmes program 3A via the holodeck [[arch]], he discovers files stored in protected memory. When Barclay runs the files contained within the arch, [[Professor]] {{dis|James Moriarty|hologram}} appears, standing in the center of the holodeck. Barclay engages him and, unprompted, throws his diagnostic device at him and establishes Moriarty is left handed, as he should be. Moriarty throws the tool to the floor and demands to see [[Captain]] [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]], surprising Barclay, who is unaware of the [[Elementary, Dear Data (episode)|previous encounter]] with Moriarty four years prior. Barclay is shocked to hear that Moriarty really knows what he is, a holodeck character, and even more so when he learns that Moriarty experienced the passage of time. Denying Moriarty's claim that he is alive, Barclay tells him that he cannot leave the holodeck when he is asked if this is possible. Moriarty suspects that Picard has forgotten all about him since their first meeting, only agreeing to try to help him leave the holodeck in order to rescue [[Katherine Pulaski|his hostage]]. He demands to see Picard in the sitting room at 221B Baker Street.  Barclay explains that he needs to store Moriarty in memory again until he has contacted Captain Picard. When Moriarty is gone, Barclay leaves the holodeck, but a brief moment later Moriarty reappears again with an amused smile on his face.   ===Act One=== :""''[[Captain's log]], [[stardate]] 46424.1. The ''[[NCC-1701-D|Enterprise]]'' has arrived at the [[Detrian system]] to observe a unique celestial event: the collision of two planets.''""  The {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-D|-D}} has come to the [[Detrian system]] to observe the collision of two [[gas giant]] planets, [[Detria II]] and [[Detria VI]], which may cause the formation of a new [[star]]. La Forge is briefing his engineering staff along with Data, ordering that he wants triple redundancies placed on all [[sensor array]]s, as they may never get another chance to view something like this again. Entering [[engineering]], Barclay tells La Forge and Data that Moriarty has appeared and that he has demanded to speak to the captain.  Later, Barclay takes the captain and Data to the holodeck, activating the sitting room at 221B Baker Street. They enter and run the Moriarty program. Picard greets Moriarty, and tells him how they have spent much time investigating how he became [[self-aware]], and how he may manage to leave the holodeck. They turned over problem of how to allow Moriarty an independent existence to Starfleet's best scientific minds, but still are awaiting an answer. Picard is concerned that Moriarty experienced the passage of time. Moriarty gets angry that while Picard and the crew experience a real life outside the holodeck door, he is left as a low priority, confined to the holodeck. Picard opens the exit, and demonstrates by throwing a book out of the door that objects will disappear when they enter the real world, as they have no substance. Moriarty claims that, as a conscious being, his willpower will maintain him outside the holodeck, quoting Descartes' Latin phrase ""''Cogito ergo sum''"" (""''I think therefore I am''""). In front of the astounded crewmembers, he walks through the holodeck door and into a corridor with no apparent ill effects.  ===Act Two===  Data calls for two security officers, causing Moriarty to remark that policemen are recognizable in any age. Everyone believes that this is impossible. Picard wishes for them to go to see [[Dr.]] [[Beverly Crusher|Crusher]]. Her [[medical tricorder|tricorder]] scan reveals that he is real, and La Forge detects no traces of loss of molecular cohesion. Crusher reports that Moriarty's [[DNA]] is a bit unusual, but all of his major systems are detected and he is functioning normally. Picard assures him that the crew will continue to investigate. Moriarty wishes to go ""above deck,"" and is surprised to see the stars outside the [[Ten Forward]] [[viewport|window]], exclaiming that they are adrift in the heavens. Picard explains to Moriarty that they are on a [[starship]]. Moriarty wishes to learn the ship's means of propulsion and how far they are from [[Earth]]. Picard offers to give him books, and asks that he remain aboard for a while. Moriarty does not care, and is excited to live his life. Picard reminds him that criminal behavior will not be tolerated in the [[24th century]] any more than it would be in the [[19th century]], to which Moriarty replies that he was only a criminal because Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] made it so. He promises that as a person, he is no criminal. Picard enumerates the opportunities beyond Moriarty's wildest dreams that await him in this century. He thanks Picard for his graciousness, and asks if they can bring out [[Countess]] [[Regina Barthalomew]]. Picard explains that they would have no idea how. Moriarty wishes to bring out the countess using a method similar to that which brought him out. He becomes angry, and begs the captain to give him his wish.   In the [[observation lounge]], the [[senior staff]] and Barclay are talking about whether they should comply with Moriarty's request. [[Counselor]] [[Deanna Troi|Troi]] understands Moriarty's frustration at being alone, without his love. Dr. Crusher thinks that they should at least fully analyze Moriarty before performing the procedure again, and Barclay agrees with this. Data remarks that they have no idea if Moriarty's ability to exist outside the holodeck is permanent, and advises not to recreate their actions until they fully understand what has happened. Picard agrees, and decides to hold off on the request. He asks for the investigation to continue, and goes to tell Moriarty of their decision.  Picard tells Moriarty in his [[quarters]] that they have decided to postpone action. Moriarty says he is tired of waiting. In an attempt to get Moriarty to understand their caution, Picard questions him about his feelings for the countess, hoping their shared concern for her safety will make him less impatient. He remarks that he would love the countess even if he had not be designed to &ndash; he adores her. Picard tells him that they will act as soon as they learn enough to allow her to leave the holodeck safely. Picard is then called to the [[bridge]] by [[Commander]] [[William T. Riker|Riker]]. On the bridge, Riker has the two planets put on screen. Picard asks [[Worf]] to launch four [[class-A probe]]s towards the planets, but the computer does not respond. Command functions have been rerouted, and Moriarty reveals that he has transferred command controls and taken over the ''Enterprise''.  ===Act Three=== Worf brandishes a [[phaser]] from under his [[tactical console]], but Moriarty warns him not to fire, as he is the only one who can release the command lockout. Picard explains the ''Enterprise'' is in grave danger. Moriarty tells him that he will relinquish control once the countess is in the real world. Picard orders Data to start working on a solution.    In engineering, Data, Barclay, and La Forge are discussing the possibility of using the [[transporter]]. Barclay asks what would happen if they attempted to beam a holodeck object off the grid. La Forge explains that a holodeck object has no pattern to lock on to, making the attempt impossible. If the object could be locked on, the transporter might work. Barclay suggests that they use the [[pattern enhancer]]s to create a way to lock on. As they are talking, Picard comes to inform them that Moriarty will not disrupt normal ship's functions as long as they work on the problem. Taking him aside, Picard asks La Forge how Moriarty gained control of the ship. Apparently Moriarty somehow managed to override the security lockouts. La Forge tells Picard that the man is brilliant in ''any'' century. Picard also asks La Forge to find a way to regain control of the ship.  Barclay returns to the holodeck to set up the pattern enhancers. When he asks the computer to run Sherlock Holmes program 3A, he is slightly puzzled when the computer tells him that program is already active. He enters to find the countess there. He is initially cautious, but after the countess makes it clear that she understands that the pattern enhancers are part of the plan to take her and Moriarty into the real world, he relaxes a little. She talks about all her adventures in [[Africa]], saying that she had a wonderful time.   Moriarty returns, and explains that he has already attempted to make the countess self-conscious in a similar way to himself. The countess explains to Moriarty that they will be using the pattern enhancers to take a chair off the holodeck and into the real world. If the experiment succeeds, the countess will be next. Barclay asks Data to proceed with the transport. Data attempts to beam the chair off, but while the chair disappears from the holodeck, nothing appears on the transporter pad; it seems to have lost its molecular cohesion as soon as the transporter cycle is finished. Data explains that they may be able to learn something from this and checks the transporter logs to see the results. But strangely, while the log exists, it contains no information. Data remarks that it is as if the transport of the chair never occurred.   Meanwhile, La Forge has asked Picard to come to engineering as he may have a way to regain control; he asks the captain to try his codes again. Picard inputs his [[command code]]s, which the computer verifies. As La Forge notices that the transfer seems to not have worked, Data arrives. He watches suspiciously as La Forge uses his [[PADD]], and after gaining his attention, tosses a small tool which La Forge catches with his left hand.  Addressing the captain, Data announces that he has determined how Moriarty managed to leave the holodeck &ndash; he never did. The entire ''Enterprise'' is actually a simulation created by Moriarty in order to fool Picard into releasing the ''Enterprise'' command codes to him.  ===Act Four===  Data explains his Holmesian deduction of this fact to the captain. The fact that by beaming a hologram off the holodeck, they were attempting something that had never been done before, and since it was a holographic transporter, the computer could have no real data to create the transport logs. He also noticed that the holographic La Forge was working with his left hand, although the real La Forge is right handed &ndash; a similar problem to the fault that first caused Barclay to activate the Moriarty hologram.  As further confirmation, Data throws his [[combadge]] at the warp core, causing the grid from the holodeck wall to show through briefly. Picard attempts to command the computer to stop the program, then calls Riker to ask him what is Picard's location on the ship. Riker says ""engineering"", causing Picard to suggest that Moriarty has their combadges tied in to his simulation.  Data explains that the only real people in this simulation are himself, Picard and Barclay, the three who originally entered the holodeck to meet Moriarty. Now that he has Picard's command codes, Picard expects Moriarty to use them to attempt make demands on the real Riker to find a way to allow him to leave the holodeck. Picard begins to muse about a plan to give Moriarty what he wants.  Aboard the real ship, Riker is indeed negotiating with Moriarty for the return of Captain Picard, Barclay, and Data. Moriarty, on the ''Enterprise'' viewscreen, appears to be in holographic [[crew quarters]]. He now has control of the ship, and Riker fears that they will not be able to move to a safe distance from the planetary collision. Moriarty demands that they must come up with a way for him to leave the holodeck, and explains the lines of research the crew on his holographic ''Enterprise'' were pursuing, telling the real crew that they must do better with their real transporters. La Forge explains that the fact that Moriarty's transporters were only holograms was probably not the only reason why their experiment didn't work. Moriarty then raises the warp core temperature to demonstrate his complete control of their ship. Riker orders La Forge to proceed with working on the problem.  Back on the holographic ''Enterprise'', Picard enters the holographic holodeck, returning to 221B Baker Street where Picard introduces himself to Countess Barthalomew. The Countess finds him charming, comparing him to a bewitching Viscount of her acquaintance. Picard explains to her a plan he says his crew have devised, to allow him to use transporters to make holograms real, by first decoupling the [[Heisenberg compensator]]s and allowing them to rescramble randomly. He appeals to her to work on Moriarty to persuade him to do the right thing by releasing the computer to him before he agrees to use this technique. After telling Picard that sounds more like a threat than a compromise, she agrees to do what she can.  Back on the real ''Enterprise'', the collision is proceeding apace. Worf is working on manually disabling the [[force field]] Moriarty has used to prevent physical access to the holodeck.  Meanwhile, in 221B Baker Street, Countess Barthalomew tells Moriarty of Picard's plan and tries to persuade him to accept Picard's proposition that they release the ship's computer. Moriarty dismisses this option and instead triumphantly calls for an [[arch]], using this to contact Riker. He tells Riker he wants him to uncouple the Heisenberg compensators.  ===Act Five=== Countess Barthalomew is putting a hat on while Moriarty explains to her how many other worlds there are to visit together. Riker communicates and tells them they are ready to transport. It appears to be successful, as Moriarty and the countess materialize on the transport pad. But Moriarty still refuses to give up control of the ship's computers until Riker agrees to give him one of the ''Enterprise'' shuttles. Riker has little choice but to agree.  Riker walks into the shuttlebay, and tells Moriarty and the countess that they have programmed a shuttle to accept voice commands &ndash; they can control the ship by simply telling it where they want to go. Riker suggests they make [[Meles II]] their first stop, as it is the closest inhabited planet and its inhabitants are friendly.  Moriarty says he's sorry he won't be able to say goodbye to the captain in person, as Picard is still trapped on the holodeck in Moriarty's program. They board the ''[[Sakharov]]'' and take off, admiring the beautiful sight of the heavens. Finally Moriarty orders the shuttle computer to interface with the ''Enterprise'' and uses his codes to release the ''Enterprise'' computer back to Riker's control.   Back in the shuttlebay, Picard enters and orders the computer to store his program ''[[Picard Delta One]]'' and discontinue simulation. The ""real"" Riker and Worf disappear, and the shuttlebay becomes a blank holodeck. Picard has fooled Moriarty with his own ""false reality"" trick. Picard then ""leaves"" the ""holodeck"" meeting Data and Barclay ""outside"". Now that Moriarty has released his control over the computer, Picard can discontinue Moriarty's fake ''Enterprise'' program. Picard checks in with Riker, who says their systems came back on line a few minutes ago, allowing them to move the ''Enterprise'' to a safe distance from the collision. Picard opens the door, and they are at last back aboard the real ''Enterprise''. Before he leaves, Barclay opens a control panel by the holodeck door and removes a yellow [[tech cube]] from the computer.   Debriefing Riker, Picard explains that the Moriarty program is still running inside that cube, and that although it is not physically realized, the Moriarty program will continue, unaware of the deception. Barclay places the cube inside a portable unit which he says contains enough active memory to provide both of them with new experiences for a lifetime. Deanna Troi observes that, in a way, Picard has indeed given them exactly what they asked for.  Picard suggests that their own reality might just be existing in a little device sitting on somebody's table for all they know, leaving a nervous Barclay to try a ""computer end program"" command. As nothing happens, he smiles, reassured, before leaving the observation lounge.  From a safe distance, the ''Enterprise'' observes the collision of planets and the formation of a brand new star.  "

==Summary==
===Introduction===
[[Susan Ivanova]] meets [[John Sheridan]] pondering in the now-empty War Room. Sheridan notes on the last time he heard from [[David Sheridan|his dad]], he learned some people were in town asking around about him. He wanted his dad to get out, but now has no information regarding him. Ivanova notes he can take care of himself, and Sheridan moves on. 

In the customs area, security has stopped a group to inspect their luggage, but their refusal to go along with it rouses suspicion. [[Zack Allan]] bursts suddenly intervenes, and after a heated argument with the man, who doesn't explain himself, Allan decides to shoot the case open. To his surprise, cameras emerge from the case &ndash; prompting the group to revea themselves as [[ISN]] reporters.

===Act I===
[[Stephen Franklin]] runs into Sheridan and informs him of some logistics in [[Medlab]]. The telepaths that the Shadows surgically altered need to be shuffled around due to mechanical problems with the cryogenic tubes (and due to the threat the pose if left unattended). Sheridan agrees his proposal and leaves to visit the ISN reporter, being held in detention. There, [[Dan Randall]] introduces himself and is frustrated with how he's been treated, and goes on telling they withheld their identities at first, since they probably wouldn't have been let on the station. Sheridan disagrees this presumption, saying they have an open-door policy, but the equipment is a different matter. He notes that ISN is a propaganda machine, and, though Randall disagrees with the idea of objectivity, he still wanted to do a story, revealing at least some of the truth, claiming it's better than none. He asks for their co-operation in this matter.

[[Michael Garibaldi]] is going with his business of helping people locate their lost ones and posessions during the Shadow War. [[Client (The Illusion of Truth)|The current client]] is describing a statue of sentimental value he lost, backing it up with a story about how he lost it. Garibaldi doesn't believe him, and call his bluff using his knowledge of [[Centauri]] and [[Drazi]] religions to poke holes in the story. The man is increasingly frustrated as Garibaldi goes on threatening to tip of tthe Drazi about his illegal conducts forcing the client to raise his fee for finding the statue. 

As the man leaves, [[Lennier]], being nearby, turns around, having listened to the conversation. Garibaldi invites Lennier to sit with him and Lennier asks why Garibaldi left. Garibaldi initially responds rather friendly, but hints a bit of frustration with everyone else asking him if he's all right. Lennier also gives Delenn's regards, but Garibaldi cuts him off, asking if [[Londo Mollari]] is back. By then, Garibaldi sees Sheridan arriving with Randall. Sheridan greets Garibaldi and asks Lennier to show Randall around, as he would be assured to have an honest tour of the station. Lennier agrees and leave with Randall. Sheridan turns to Garibaldi, but leaves without saying a word. Garibaldi suddenly has a flashback of his abduction ordeal.

===Act II===
Randall and Lennier converse in a lift. As the cameras occasionally bump into Lennier's head, making him uncomfortable, Randall asks about the damaged ships and who pays for the repairs. They arrive at [[Downbelow]] prrompting Lennier to explain the situation there. They briefly encpunyter Franklin go by helping a patient and Randall asks to interview him later. Franklin gets a call about the cryogenic chambers, and the brief exchange is captured on camera.

Mollari follows Sheridan into the [[Zócalo]] to complain about a temperature problem in his quarters. As they talk, a picture of Mollari pointing his finger at Sheridan is captured by an ISN camera.

Delenn and Sheridan sit down with Randall. He starts with B5's declaration of independence, and the two explain that they were forced to do so and would be happy to re-join once martial law is lifted and President Clark resigns. Randall also asks about their accusation that Clark is behind [[Luis Santiago]]'s death, and Sheridan explains their actions due to it as well. Randall also inquiry about their close relationship, and that there must be a lot of misgivings to that. The two explain that they do expect resistance, but that no one willl be able to stop what they begun. The camera takes a picture.

Randall then finds Garibaldi, this time without his entourage. Garibaldi doesn't respond well initially to his approach, but Randall persists in to getting him to open up just a bit, and he re-considers, by ousting his misgivings on Sheridan's behaviour and actions after returning from the rim of space to his suspicions of how he would react to the interview, finishing the scene by saying that ''""someone has to say something""''. 

Ivanova sits for dinner in Sheridan's office to watch the ISN broadcast, together with Sheridan. Delenn arrives just as Sheridan turns on the broadcast.

===Act III===
The ISN broadcast starts, hosted by [[Alison Higgins]]. The dictatorship's propaganda broadcast resumes; with the Clark adminstration announcing that 75% of Mars has been taken back and of the Senate holding hearings on anti-Earth activities. The broadcast includes a damning confession from a writer, [[Lee Parks]], who has clearly been subjected to psychological torture prompting him to name his alleged co-conspirators, reciting a forced statement, that undoubtedly was put in front of him. The introduction ends with a mention of '''""this day in history.""''', briefly recapping historical events.

Dan Randall resumes with the next segment on the B5 story. The video is played with completely intentially misrepresented dialog on top. He turns to the question of why a ""renegade"" like Sheridan would do what he did. He turns to a live conversation with psychologist, [[William Indiri]], who notes a probable cause, as an inferiority complex suffered by veterans of the [[Battle of the Line]]. Randall then implies this to a large conspiracy, cutting to when Franklin got called on the cryogenic chambers.

===Act IV===
Randall resumes, showing the Minbari cruiser outside the station being repaired. A heavily re-edited interview with Sheridan and Delenn interpreting the dialogue as if they are putting Human-Minbari relationships above the interests of Earth and those standing in their way. Then he cuts off, showing his interview with Garibaldi, when he admits that he believes Sheridan has been acting differently, hinting on a god complex. Next, he shows that they went to Medlab to take a look at the cryogenic chambers, noting that the names don't match those on of transport manifests. He claims that people are being subjected to Sheridan's will, and, if resisting, put into cryogenic stasis. He suggests that, with a military force like they possess, have the means of enforcing their goals.

===Act V===
Randall resumes his interview with Franklin, who explains the difficulties they face. Randall asks him about the cryogenic chambers and Franklin denies that they are being utilised, beyond a few extreme cases. Randall returns to Indiri, who says he's worried, because he percieves a self-loathing of one's own kind and an empathy for of aliens. He also hesitantly suggests that Sheridan is mentally ill and would refrain from diagnozing at a glance, but hints on Sheridan suffering from some form of MWS, based on the interviews and otherwise segments.

Randall also suggests that Delenn's transformation is the result of surgerical alteration performed by the B5 on Sheridan's order to put his perceptions of himself to others into action - making himself and those around him look more alien. He laments that they should have seen foreseen Sheridan's condition, and plays the empathetic observer. He also reveals that his family's farm was burned to the ground and his father is missing, further putting pressure on Sheridan psyche.

Randall ends the program by signing himself off. Ivanova promptly storms out, Delenn puts her hand on Sheridan (''to console him''), then leaves, leaving Sheridan to angrily shut off the transmission, thus ending the episode.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"== Summary == === Teaser === [[Commander]] [[Chakotay]] suggests using a [[trinary star system]] as a focal [[map]] point for the sector the {{USS|Voyager}} is passing through. [[Ensign]] [[Harry Kim]] asks if ''Voyager'' had been to this system before, only to have [[Tuvok]] suggest that he was experiencing a ""''paradoxical state dependent associative phenomenon''"", or as [[Captain]] [[Kathryn Janeway|Janeway]] puts it, ""''[[déjà vu]]''"".  When ''Voyager'' encounters an alien ship they have never seen before (the [[Nasari]] ship ''[[Nerada]]''), Kim instinctively transfers tactical control to [[operations station|his station]]. Though the Nasari show no apparent hostile intent, Kim raises ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[shields]] and fires [[phaser]]s without orders, claiming that the alien vessel is charging weapons.   === Act One === ''Voyager'' takes heavy damage in defending itself from the Nasari vessel, forcing them to withdraw. Janeway demands Kim explain his actions, and Harry tells her that he just knew the Nasari were going to attack. Tuvok says he detected nothing but a [[tetryon]] surge coming from their ship, and points out that there could be any number of explanations for that. Kim is suspended from duty, and shadowed by a security guard, pending investigation of his overly-hostile actions. {{Lieutenant}} [[B'Elanna Torres]] was severely injured during the attack in [[engineering]] and is brought to [[sickbay]].   Kim then goes to sickbay on Captain Janeway's orders to look at a cut on his forehead and to watch [[The Doctor]] and [[Kes]] treating Torres' injuries. He feels extremely guilty over his actions and Kes comforts him, telling him that what's done is done and that he cannot change that fact.  During the night, Kim has a strange dream while asleep in his [[quarters]] and when he awakens, he goes to his [[bathroom]] to find he has a strange [[rash]] all over his face.  === Act Two === In sickbay, The Doctor scans Kim with his [[medical tricorder]] and cannot find an initial cause. However, when Kim remembers dreaming about [[Mendakan pox]] he had as a child and suggests a possible connection, The Doctor half-sarcastically tells the ensign he will note it. Fortunately, Torres then wakes up and is all right, proving as such by teasing Kim about his condition.  Kim reports to the [[captain's ready room]] and admits fault about starting the last engagement. Janeway reveals that he was right about the Nasari ship charging weapons, and they would have caught ''Voyager'' with her shields down had he not acted. The question now is how did Harry know they were going to attack. Kim can only say this part of space has become increasingly familiar.  Tuvok suddenly alerts Janeway that there are three Nasari ships approaching them. Kim immediately has a star chart pulled up on one of ''Voyager''{{'}}s computers at the ship's [[conn]] and convinces Janeway to set a course to a nearby system. Upon arriving, Kim sees a planet and knows its name is [[Taresia]]. Prior to being attacked by the Nasari, ''Voyager'' is defended by an unknown ship which forces the Nasari vessels to retreat. ''Voyager'' answers a hail from the unknown ship which is from Taresia. [[Lyris|The woman]] communicating with ''Voyager'' from the [[Taresian]] ship recognizes Harry as a Taresian and welcomes him home.  === Act Three === :""''Captain's log, stardate 50732.4. The Taresians have escorted us back to their home world so we can continue to investigate their claim that Ensign Kim is a member of their race.''""  Kim, Janeway, Tuvok, and [[Tom Paris|Paris]] [[beam]] down to Taresia. The Taresians tell a shocking story of how Kim was implanted with their [[DNA]] at birth. When he was an [[embryo]], he was put in [[stasis]] and taken to [[Earth]], where he was implanted in the [[womb]] of a [[Human]] woman, [[Mary Kim|his mother]]. After the implantation process, Kim began to incorporate DNA from his ""surrogate"" parent, so he developed as a Human. Tuvok asks if ''all'' of their children are born to alien parents. Lyris tells him yes, and that each child that returns to their homeworld brings an infusion of genetic material as well as firsthand information of alien species. After this revelation, Kim decides to stay with the Taresians, at least temporarily, to learn more about his newfound species and himself. ''Voyager'' leaves orbit to attempt negotations with the Nasari. They learn from the Nasari, [[Alben]], that the Taresian males who return to Taresia never leave, but, oddly, provides no more information and promises to fire if they do manage to get Kim back.   ''Voyager'' returns to Taresia where they find a protective [[polaron grid]] encircling the planet which also blocks communications. ""''I guess we're not welcome anymore''"", Chakotay tells Janeway.  === Act Four === Kim participates in the joining ([[marriage]]) ceremony of another male Taresian, [[Taymon]], where he is joined (married) to three women. Eliann tells Kim that he will remember how to perform the ceremony with everyone else as soon as it begins. After the ceremony is over, Kim tries to contact ''Voyager'' through his [[combadge]] but is unsuccessful. Lyris tells him the ship may still be conducting negotiations with the Nasari and therefore delayed. She encourages him to join the wedding celebration while he waits.  Back on ''Voyager'', Janeway and Chakotay walk down a [[corridor]] towards sickbay. Chakotay announces to the captain that the crew has been able to poke some holes in the tachyon grid, but ''Voyager'' is too big to go through. Janeway asks if a shuttle could, but Chakotay doubts it. Even if it could, a powerful Taresian vessel patrols the other side. Upon entering sickbay, The Doctor meets with the captain and [[first officer]] in his office to inform them that he discovered something about Kim's Taresian DNA: it was implanted, possibly by a [[retrovirus]]. The Doctor confirms that Kim ''is'' fully Human but warns them that the alien DNA from is beginning to alter his genetic structure; in a few days he will be indistinguishable from a Taresian. The Doctor reviewed the transporter [[biofilter]] [[log]]s and found that the alien DNA made its first appearance on [[stardate]] 50698. Chakotay remembers that was the date of [[Darkling (episode)|the away mission]] on the planet where [[Vorillium]] was found. The Taresian's whole story was a lie but Janeway wonders why the Taresians would go to so much trouble to lure Kim to their planet.  Meanwhile, on Taresia, Kim is led to his quarters by Eliann. She tells him to lie on his bed and relax. ""''Lekaria san''"", she tells him. She asks if he understands the Taresian word. ""''Pleasant dreams''"", he replies. She asks him to close his eyes while she applies ""''the essence of [[rikka flower]]s''"" to Kim, something very soothing. Kim [[kiss]]es Eliann and promptly falls asleep. However, Kim begins experiencing some more strange dreams, of Taresian women welcoming him home, of Janeway and Chakotay on ''Voyager''{{'}}s bridge, telling him how lucky they've been to have him and how special he has been all his life. His mother appears and tells him he ''knows'' where his real home is. Suddenly, Eliann appears and asks him to stay with her as they begin to kiss passionately. Doubt begins to creep up on Kim after waking up to two ''very'' ""interested"" Taresian females, Eliann and [[Rinna]]. They try to reassure him but their attempts to do so instead make him outright suspicious. Kim ties up Eliann and knocks out Rinna so he can escape. Kim makes it to Taymon's quarters to try to free him as well. When he enters, he finds Taymon's corpse in bed.  === Act Five === One of Taymon's wives, [[Malia]], enters the quarters and Kim overpowers her. He learns what The Doctor discovered and that the Taresian [[sexual reproduction|reproductive process]] is deadly to the male, meaning that more males have to be repeatedly harvested from space due to the high female population. Taymon's other two wives enter the quarters. Kim throws Malia at them to continue his escape and they all fall onto Taymon's [[bed]].  ''Voyager'' finally finds a way to get inside the polaron grid and [[beam]]s Kim up as he is surrounded by more Taresian women who try to forcibly have him joined, armed with their staffs. When ''Voyager'' leaves the system, a Taresian ship fires at ''Voyager'' when three Nasari ships appear and also fire at ''Voyager'' and the Taresian ship. The Nasari later concentrate their fire on the Taresian ship allowing ''Voyager'' to leave.  Kim meets with [[Neelix]] and Lieutenant Paris at the [[mess hall]] where he tells the [[Talaxian]] the story of [[Odysseus]] and the call of the [[siren]]s, a tale strikingly similar to the situation he just found himself in. The captain of ancient ships ordered the crew to block their ears in order not to be seduced by the singing of the sirens. The sirens would cause the ships to crash, marooning the crew. Neelix says he's glad Kim is back aboard but admits he misses the spots Kim had. Kim tells Paris that he wished he was more like Paris with women. Paris states he has tried to be like Kim since he joined the crew of ''Voyager.'' Paris puts his hand on Kim's shoulder as he tells the young man he is ""''reliable, hard working, extremely punctual. Did I mention polite?''"" ""''Thanks a lot''"", Kim replies.  "
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0," == Summary == === Teaser === [[Ezri Dax]], [[Julian Bashir]] and [[Odo]] are sitting in [[Quark's Bar, Grill, Gaming House and Holosuite Arcade|Quark's]] ordering drinks. Quark comments that Odo doesn't drink and wonders why he ordered [[Bajoran springwine]]. Odo explains that he ordered it for [[Kira Nerys|Kira]] who will be joining them as soon as she finishes attending services at the [[Bajoran temple|temple]]. When Kira arrives, the group briefly discusses [[religion]] and the concepts of faith and forgiveness when Odo makes a comment that he wishes he did believe in the [[Prophet]]s and [[Bajoran religion]] so that they could go to services together.  Later, Kira is visited in her [[quarters]] by [[Vedek]] [[Fala]], one of Kira's teachers from during the [[Cardassian]] [[Occupation of Bajor]], and she greets him warmly. The two catch up on old times and Fala presents Kira with a gift. She opens it to find what appears to be an unusual jewel. Suddenly it glows, and Fala watches calmly as Kira is beamed away.   A shocked Kira rematerializes to be greeted by a group of Bajorans and welcomed to the previously abandoned [[outpost]] of [[Empok Nor]], the jewel actually being a [[homing transponder]] which allowed her to be transported over such a long distance. She sees the Bajorans around her are wearing red armbands, marking them as members of the [[Cult of the Pah-wraiths]], and demands to know why she's been brought there. She is told that their leader wishes to talk to her, and their leader turns out to be none other than [[Dukat]].  === Act One === Dukat, also wearing an [[armband]] as well as a red [[Bajoran earring]], dismisses the group and proceeds to attempt to convince Kira to believe in the [[Pah-wraith]]s, with the argument that the Prophets stood by and did nothing during the Occupation. This doesn't faze Kira, as the Prophets' path is not easy to fathom. Dukat explains that the Pah-wraiths only wanted to take a more active role in the Bajorans' lives, and for that they were cast out and imprisoned. Only wanting to love the people more, they should be considered the true gods. Dukat calls himself the Emissary of the Pah-wraiths and says they speak to him, and ""opened his heart."" He has pierced his [[ear]] as a symbolic gesture of the covenant between himself and the people there.    He admits that [[Tears of the Prophets (episode)|when he first allowed himself to be possessed]], he only wanted to seek revenge on [[Benjamin Sisko]], but now he's a changed man and regrets the death of [[Jadzia Dax]], stating that the [[Bajoran wormhole|Celestial Temple]] was at stake and she was simply in the way. He maintains his front that he wasn't responsible for the Occupation, but now, he justifies it by saying he was simply walking the path of the Prophets. Now, he's going to follow the plan for the Pah-wraiths to reclaim the Celestial Temple.  Furthermore, he wants Kira to see their community and convince her because he wants her at his side. She blatantly refuses to believe him, responding that the people don't love him; he has some kind of hold over them. Dukat states plainly that Kira and his destinies are entwined &ndash; she belongs at his side.  === Act Two === On [[Deep Space 9]], the crew has become aware of Kira's disappearance. With a [[Starfleet tricorder|tricorder]], [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]] has been able to establish how she was abducted but tells [[Captain]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] there is no way to find out where she went. Odo is also unable to establish who Kira met with in her quarters before she disappeared, as her visitor left the station immediately after on a [[Bajoran transport 010|regular transport]] to Bajor, meaning the crew are left at a dead end.  Kira, being kept in quarters, is met by Fala. She is very disappointed in him while he admits that he joined the [[cult]] years earlier because he had lost faith in the Prophets. Kira is shaken by her friend's admission and can't believe he abandoned all the people he helped. Fala defends the ""cult,"" taking issue with each of Kira's characterizations of their group. He also explains that [[Bajoran assassin 001|the individual]] [[Image in the Sand (episode)|who tried to kill Sisko]] acted alone from his misguided beliefs. He believes Dukat has been ""washed clean"" by the Pah-wraiths and has forgiven his past. He then shows her the community they have built to show her she has nothing to fear. During a walk with Fala on Empok Nor's [[Promenade]], Kira meets a young [[pregnant]] woman named [[Mika]]. She congratulates her, but then oddly finds out she needed permission to have a baby with her husband, [[Benyan]]. Fala explains that it is part of their covenant with Dukat to take vows of abstinence, reflective of ancient Bajoran traditions. Kira is skeptical. She meets Benyan while he [[painting|paints]] a mural of Dukat along with his Bajoran followers. Benyan doesn't respond to Kira's subtle disagreement.  Later, she's taken to a prayer meeting. As everyone else closes their eyes and chants, Kira takes the opportunity to grab a [[Bajoran phaser]] from another member of the cult and threatens Dukat. However, several cult members shield Dukat from danger, showing their belief. She tries to back out, but someone knocks her unconscious.  ===Act Three === Kira awakes to find Dukat taking care of her. She is outraged at his faux concern, since looking at the bruise on her back gave him an opportunity to undress her. After another argument wherein she accuses Dukat of using his follower's religious devotion to build another empire complete with subjects who are devoted to him on the station, she is determined to expose his fraud. Dukat has had a meal prepared for Kira and Kira briefly considers trying to kill him with the cutlery on the meal tray. But Dukat points out that even if Kira could kill him; there is no way she can escape, and Kira would only make a martyr out of him. She cannot believe his followers are willing and that he is as changed as he sounds. He also points out that [[Kira Meru|Kira's mother]] really loved him, but she responds she convinced herself of that since he had control over her real family.   Mika soon goes into labor, so Dukat brings Kira to the [[infirmary]]. However, when her child is born, it is half-Cardassian, shocking the two parents. Dukat also feigns shock, but, without a beat, excitedly declares that the Pah-wraiths have sent them a sign of their covenant. Mika's face shows she clearly doesn't believe this ""miracle."" Kira doesn't believe either, of course, but the rest of the congregation, including Fala, accept Dukat's explanation. He starts to lead them in prayer, and Kira is utterly shocked.  ===Act Four=== Kira immediately confronts Fala with this turn of events, appealing to his intelligence. Fala defends Dukat's words, arguing that a miracle is a possibility that cannot be ruled out. Indeed, if the Prophets [[Sacrifice of Angels (episode)|can disappear an entire fleet]] of [[Dominion]] ships, they are capable of anything. Kira, on the other hand, knows Fala too well to believe that he would accept this without question. When Kira pushes him hard enough, he admits to suspecting her version of the truth, but he asserts that he has faith in his beliefs and that he wants to follow where his faith leads him. Her further conversations with Benyan make it obvious that Benyan has serious doubts about Dukat's version of events.  Meanwhile, Dukat and Mika meet in secret to discuss the situation and Dukat asks her why she didn't tell him her child was his. Dukat apologizes to Mika, and it is revealed that he [[rape]]d her during a prayer session and Dukat at least pretends to feel guilty for raping Mika. After he gets her forgiveness, learns of her husband's disbelief and her unwillingness to lie to him if he asks, he traps her in the airlock they were speaking in and flushes the air out, refusing to make eye contact with her as she goes unconscious. Kira and Fala who are looking for Mika to ask her about the ""miracle,"" save her just in time. Mika is taken to sickbay and treated for her injuries. Dukat claims it was an accident, Kira loudly objects stating the obvious truth. Dukat sends her to her quarters and leads the onlookers in prayer. Benyan looks on skeptically.  Later, Dukat prays alone in his quarters and asks for guidance. He states that the truth will come out and the covenant will dissolve. Later, at a sudden prayer meeting, Dukat then makes a great announcement: the Pah-wraiths have asked everyone to shed their corporeal existences to help reclaim the Celestial Temple. To accomplish this, he says that everyone, including him, will commit [[suicide]]. Kira listens in her quarters surprised.  ===Act Five=== Dukat visits Kira and informs her that he has contacted Deep Space 9; they will send a ship to pick her up within a day. Kira does not believe he will die with them. He reassures her that all of their deaths will be painless, thanks to [[Promazine]], a pill used by the [[Obsidian Order]] operatives to commit suicide in the event of capture and the bodies become dust in hours and so he does not fear it. He will be with the Pah-wraiths, and that is his salvation. Kira is finally convinced he believes what he's saying. ""''Goodbye, Nerys&hellip;''"", Dukat says to Kira before walking out.  As the ceremony begins, Kira manages to escape from her cell by overloading the door's locking mechanism. She rushes into the hall from the second level, and knocks down Dukat as he holds his tablet, as well as a pedestal containing dozens more. He starts searching in vain for his particular tablet as she is restrained. When Fala hands Dukat another tablet, he cannot accept it. Kira realizes Dukat's original pill was a fake and he never intended to kill himself. When she calls him on his duplicity, and the crowd becomes restless, Dukat protests that he alone must live to show others the light of the Pah-wraiths. None believe him, and the order falls apart; Benyan finally realizes the truth of his child's birth and turns on Dukat. As he loses control, Dukat shouts to them that the covenant is broken, and transports out.  Fala, despite all this, sits down and ingests his tablet. Kira holds her friend as he dies and wants to know why he did it, his only answer is ""Faith.""  The {{USS|Defiant|2370}} arrives and picks up Kira and the other cult members. Kira tells Odo about Fala's last words, not knowing he had lost his faith or still believed in the Pah-wraiths. Also, she admits that while she originally believed that Dukat was only pretending to believe in the Pah-wraiths to get the Bajorans to follow him, she is now convinced he does truly believe in them, despite his continued despotic patterns and that everything he did was in their service. Odo also notes the possibility that Dukat really did receive the suicide order from the Pah-wraiths. Either way, he is far more dangerous now than ever…"

==Plot==
Arthur and Norma Lewis are slowly descending into abject poverty. One day, they receive a mysterious locked box with a button on it and a note that says Mr. Steward will come visit. Then, just as the note says, a smartly dressed stranger who introduces himself as Steward comes to their door when Arthur is out. He gives Norma the key to the box and explains that, if they press the button, two things will happen: they will receive $200,000, and someone ""whom [they] don't know"" will die.

After the stranger leaves, the Lewis's wonder whether Steward's proposal is genuine, and they agonize over whether to press the button. Norma rationalizes that they could make good use of the money and that the one who dies might be some Chinese peasant or cancer sufferer who is living a miserable life. Arthur takes the side that, since they do not know who will die, pressing the button may cause the death of an innocent baby. They open the box and discover no mechanism inside it—it is simply an empty box with a button on it. Arthur angrily throws the box in the trash. However, in the middle of the night while Arthur is asleep, Norma goes to the apartment building's dumpster and retrieves the device. The next day, Arthur leaves for work and sees Norma sitting at the kitchen table, her gaze transfixed on the button. At the end of the day, he returns from work and it appears that nothing has changed; Norma is still sitting and concentrating only on the button. The days go by. Norma and Arthur keep talking about the box, when suddenly Norma decides that she will push the button.

The next day Mr. Steward returns, takes back the box, and gives them a briefcase with the $200,000. The Lewises are in shock and ask what will happen next. Steward ominously replies that the button will be ""reprogrammed"" and''<u> offered to someone else with the same terms and conditions, adding as he focuses on Norma: ""I can assure you it will be offered to someone whom you don't know.</u>''"" A horrified, knowing expression crosses Norma's face.

== Overview ==
The Dwarfers take ''[[Starbug]]'' down into the watery depths of an [[ocean moon]] to investigate the wreck of ''[[SSS Esperanto]]''. They find that the ship's crew have committed suicide, then escape to try and avoid attack from a sea monster,  ""[[GELF#Despair Squid|Despair Squid]]"". The crew suddenly wake up to find they are not who they think they are, ''[[Red Dwarf (ship)|Red Dwarf]]'' and ''Starbug'' did not exist, and they have in fact been playing [[Red Dwarf (TIV Game)|a virtual reality computer game]] for four years.

== Summary ==
The [[Boys from the Dwarf]] don [[space suit]]s and take ''[[Starbug]]'' down to investigate the wreckage of ''[[SSS Esperanto]]'', a ship conducting marine seeding experiments at the bottom of an [[ocean moon|ocean-covered moon]] designed to speed up evolution. This [[terraforming]] mission was going so well that they had topped even their best projections. Despite this and the [[Black Box|black box]]'s final entry appearing routine, it appears that all life on board ''Esperanto'' committed suicide, either by gunshot, hanging or [[wikipedia:Seppuku|seppuku]], right down to a haddock fish which closed its gills and suffocated itself.

The Dwarfers discover the deaths are due to severe depression caused by a hallucinogenic nerve toxin which was secreted by a giant [[Despair Squid]] to which [[Dave Lister|Lister]], [[Kryten]] and [[Cat]] are exposed to a reduced dosage, which simply causes them to all burst into tears. [[Diving Bell|Re-boarding]] ''Starbug'', the crew use a mood-stabilising gas to counteract the ink from the despair squid, and discover the creature has returned and is approaching ''Starbug''. Concluding the likely options are that the creature intends to either kill, eat or hump them, the crew try and make a run for it. However they are exposed to a massive dose of the ink, and while Lister is distracted causes ''Starbug'' to collide with some rocks, causing the ship to crash and explode.

Instead of finding themselves in little pieces, they wake to discover that for four years they have been playing the [[Total Immersion Video Game]] version of ''[[Red Dwarf (TIV Game)|Red Dwarf the Game]]''. Everyone now looks different; Lister has a ponytail, Rimmer has large white hair, Kryten is half-human, and Cat has a bowl haircut and a massive overbite. Before their real memories have returned, [[Andy (Back to Reality)|Andy the Techie]] informs them that they only scored four percent in four years of playing, completely failing to notice the most basic of clues, and then moves them on to the recuperation lounge, whilst a [[Alternate Dwarfers (Back to Reality)|new, hunky group of Dwarfers]] begin playing the ''Red Dwarf'' game, much more successfully than the last, with the new action-hero Lister saving [[Kochanski]] and winning her back early on.

In the recuperation lounge, The old gang learn their real identities: [[Kryten]] is half-human Cybernautics Division Detective traffic officer [[Jake Bullet]], [[Cat]] is dorky [[Duane Dibbley]], [[Dave Lister|Lister]] is [[Sebastian Doyle]], whose case is filled with expensive items, including the keys to a limo, and [[Arnold Rimmer|Rimmer]] is [[William Doyle]], Lister's half brother and a tramp. While anything substantial about Lister's true identity remains a mystery, Kryten is more than pleased with his new persona.

The gang begin exploring and quickly learn that the [[Earth]] they're on is ruled over by [[Fascist Earth|a fascist regime]]. They head to the long-term car park, where Lister's limo is waiting for them, however they then run into a fascist cop chasing a child who has stolen an apple. They learn from him that Sebastian Doyle is the head of the police ruling over the people, and is personally responsible for murdering anyone who steps out of line. The cop then tries to shoot the fleeing child, and Kryten is forced to kill him... and at this point it is revealed that the crew are still on ''Starbug'', hallucinating as [[Holly]] is trying without success to snap them out of their shared delusion of a high-speed car chase with the police.

Escaping down an alley, Kryten is ready to kill himself over his actions and the others, unable to accept the new world they're living in or their new identities, decide to commit suicide too by sharing the only bullet Kryten has left. Holly then manages to get through to Kryten and instructs him to open up the mood-stabilising gas. After he's done so, he returns to the others but before he can pull the trigger, Holly finally manages to bring them all round, welcoming them back to reality. She explains they were caught in a group hallucination brought on by the toxic ink of the despair squid designed to attack their self-esteem and, reduce them to suicidal levels of anguish (which is what happened to the crew of ''Esperanto''); Kryten killed a human being, the vain Cat's life had no meaning in a world where he was a dork, Rimmer could no longer blame his failures on others because he shared an upbringing with the wealthy Lister, and Lister, normally a good man of moral courage, is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of innocent people.

The illusion broken, and the Despair Squid taken care of with [[Explosives|limpet mines]], the crew start the long voyage home back to ''Red Dwarf''. Lister notes that the people responsible screwed up by creating a creature that was so deadly it wiped out all other forms on life on the planet. Kryten jokes that the same could be said of humans, but the comment is not appreciated and the weary crew head home.

Garak laughs it off, as he always does. When a young [[Cardassian]] boy, wearing a [[Bajoran earring]] and escorted by a [[Bajoran]] man, sits down near them, Garak cannot resist commenting on it. He goes over to the man and says what a nice boy he has. The boy bites Garak's hand, and shies away.  === Act One === After making sure Garak's hand is not severely damaged, the doctor reports to [[operations center|ops]], and tells the [[senior staff]] about the incident. [[Odo]] leaves immediately to investigate. Everyone is baffled; then [[Gul]] [[Dukat]] calls on [[subspace]] to ask about the issue. When [[Commander]] [[Benjamin Sisko]] skeptically asks Dukat how the news reached him so quickly, Dukat quickly changes the subject. He says the boy is one of the many war orphans left behind when the Cardassians left [[Bajor]] at the end of the [[Occupation of Bajor|occupation]]. He asks Sisko to investigate this incident, since he is trying to get the orphans returned to Cardassia. Sisko agrees.  First, Sisko talks to the father, [[Proka Migdal]]. He is initially agitated, thinking that Garak filed a complaint and they want to arrest him. When Sisko explains they just want to talk, he relaxes slightly. He wishes that the Cardassians would have paid as much attention to his boy then as they want to now. He insists that he adopted [[Rugal]] so that Rugal wouldn't have to suffer for the mistakes of others, and that Garak should have minded his own business. The doctor points out that the boy was terrified of Garak, and that he was probably raised to hate Cardassians. The father agrees that Rugal hates Cardassians, because the facts alone would &ndash; and should &ndash; make him hate Cardassians. He loves his son, just as if he were his own flesh and blood, and considers him a Bajoran.  Continuing the investigation, Doctor Bashir goes to [[Quark's]] and talks to [[Zolan]], a trader who knows the family well. He is evasive, but when the doctor presses him, he explains that he had visited the family a few times when the father was looking for a new job. He tells Bashir that Rugal is being raised in a terrible way &ndash; being told every day that he is horrible for being a Cardassian &ndash; and that the parents are taking out their revenge against all Cardassians on the boy. When Sisko and Bashir confront Proka, he is outraged, saying he has done nothing. Sisko accepts his word, but has Rugal stay with the station's school [[teacher]] [[Keiko O'Brien]] for the time being.  Rugal says he didn't do anything wrong when his father brings him out. He is nervous, but finally goes with Sisko and Bashir when the father says they won't hurt him, because they're [[Human]], not Cardassian. Before leaving, Sisko offers Proka a slight nod of his head.  === Act Two === Back in the [[infirmary]], Doctor Bashir heals Garak's hand, and mentions Gul Dukat's attempt to resolve the war orphan predicament. Garak laughs and begins a line of questioning of his own. He plants in Bashir's mind that Dukat's story should not be believed: Dukat was in charge of the withdrawal from Bajor, therefore it is his fault that the children were left behind, so why is he trying to get them returned home?  Back in ops, Sisko is explaining to Dukat that it may not be very simple to send Rugal back to Cardassia. When the doctor arrives, Sisko asks Dukat to look up the boy's [[DNA]] to search for any surviving relatives, in case he does decide to send him home. Dukat agrees, then Doctor Bashir interrupts. He asks Dukat why he chose to leave the children behind. Dukat is not pleased, and explains that he was ordered to do it by the civilian leadership of Cardassia and had no choice. Bashir corrects him, and states that the civilian leaders do not have such detailed control of the military. When Dukat asks where he got this information, he admits it was from Garak. Dukat tells Bashir to tell Garak he had no choice, and cuts off the viewscreen.  Sisko asks why the doctor presumptuously interrupted his conversation with Dukat. Bashir explains that Garak thinks Dukat is lying &ndash; which he had to deduce, since Garak doesn't actually tell him anything. Sisko is not pleased, but lets him off with a rebuke.  Meanwhile, in the O'Briens' [[crew quarters|quarters]], Chief [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]] is initially uneasy around Rugal given his own previous experiences with Cardassians, and is aghast to learn that Keiko allowed [[Molly O'Brien|Molly]] to play with him. Keiko warns him that she doesn't appreciate his prejudiced attitude. Later that night, Rugal is unable to sleep and O'Brien takes the chance to talk to the boy (who denies being abused) about his situation. O'Brien asks if it's hard on him being Cardassian. Rugal becomes defensive, saying he was born that way and it isn't his fault. The chief rephrases his question: ""''Isn't it hard to live with people who hate you?''"" Rugal answers that his parents hate other Cardassians, not him, and they have done nothing wrong to him. When he asks what Miles thinks of Cardassians, the chief explains that he can't generalize an opinion about an entire race &ndash; he has met Cardassians he didn't like, and Cardassians he did like. Rugal doesn't understand how the chief could feel that way, since the Cardassians killed ten million Bajorans, and wishes he were Bajoran.  === Act Three === In the middle of the night, Garak sneaks into Bashir's quarters and says that they need to go to Bajor now. The doctor wakes Sisko up and tries to explain, not very coherently, that he and Garak need a [[runabout]] right away to go to Bajor for something important, which Garak won't tell him. At the same time, Ops informs Sisko through the com that there is a communication for him from Gul Dukat. He informs Sisko that the boy's DNA has identified him as the son of a prominent politician, [[Kotan Pa'Dar]], who is still alive &ndash; so the boy is actually not an orphan. Pa'Dar is heading to the station to reclaim him. Sisko repeats that it's not that simple; the boy wants to go back to Bajor, and he won't send him to Cardassia against his will. Pa'Dar will have to wait for the investigation to finish. Bashir points out that Garak's urgency, the trader who made the accusation of abuse vanishing, and the news about Pa'Dar can't be a coincidence, and Garak must know something. This convinces Sisko to give them the runabout.   Garak and Bashir head down to the [[Tozhat Resettlement Center]], an orphanage for Cardassian children and ask about Rugal. {{dis|Deela|Bajoran}}, the person in charge, says that since Rugal's adoption occurred eight years ago, when the Cardassians were still in charge, she probably doesn't have the information. Garak responds with a correction that Cardassians always keep meticulous records, and if they would let him use their computer, he might be able to find the file. When she says that the government hasn't had the resources yet to repair her computer system, he offers to fix it himself.  After repairing the computer, Garak downloads all the provincial records into a data clip. This again makes Bashir skeptical that Garak isn't a spy. The wind is taken out of Garak's sails, however, when he spots a couple of Cardassians watching him, with a young girl asking if he's there to take them back to Cardassia. Garak has to regretfully inform them that, no, he has not come to take them home. Garak informs Deela that the computer system is now fully functional before leaving.  === Act Four === When they are in orbit, Dr. Bashir gets tired of being strung along. He has the computer shut down the runabout's engines and demands that Garak give him some information or they will sit in space until they rot, he says. Garak explains that Dukat had to leave behind the children, as orphans have no status in Cardassian society. This isn't enough for Bashir, who demands some answers or they will sit there until they rot. With that ultimatum, Garak plays another round of twenty questions. He helps Bashir put it all together: Pa'Dar was one of the most notable civilian leaders at the time, and was involved in the decision to end the occupation and evacuate Bajor; Gul Dukat lost his job as prefect when that happened, so he hates Pa'Dar; and now, mysteriously, this boy turns up, and Dukat coincidentally finds out it is Pa'Dar's long lost son.  Pa'Dar shows up on the station, and Chief O'Brien talks to him before he sees Rugal. He explains that the boy hates everything he is, and probably won't react well to see him. Pa'Dar insists that he is the boy's father, so all of that will change. He explains that on his son's fourth birthday, a bomb blew up their house, and the father was convinced he was dead. Family is very important to Cardassians, he says, and he has come here despite the disgrace it will bring him (because there is no excuse for ""losing"" a member of his family) for that reason. When Rugal walks in, he is scared and stunned. He doesn't remember his father's face, and wants nothing to do with him, despite his father's pain and explanation of what happened. He says his father deserved his pain, and that his son is dead; he will never go back to Cardassia.  The next fight is between Pa'Dar and Proka. Pa'Dar demands that no Bajoran court rule on the custody hearing. After some loud words, Sisko suggests an [[arbitrator]], and both suggest him. Pa'Dar accepts, and then Odo informs him that Gul Dukat has just arrived on the station.  === Act Five === :""''Station's log, stardate 47177.2. The arrival of Gul Dukat only powers my suspicion that we are being manipulated in some unseen manner. Dr. Bashir and Garak continue to search for anything of relevance in the adoption files. So far, they have found nothing, and the decision on custody for Rugal cannot wait much longer.''""  Dukat explains he has come to observe the hearing, because there is great interest in the case at high levels of the Cardassian government. He wants to see Rugal reunited with his father. He says the disagreements between him and Pa'Dar are not relevant; it is the children who are important. Since Sisko is trying to stall for time to give Bashir and Garak more time to search the files, he asks Pa'Dar to again revisit the events from eight years ago.  The doctor and Garak, however, aren't having any luck. Garak soon realizes it is because Dukat probably purged the file on Rugal, since there was something in it he didn't want anyone to see. So, he looks for &ndash; and finds within seconds &ndash; the person who created the file, [[Jomat Luson]].  While Sisko asks Rugal what he remembers about his adoption and gets nothing, the doctor and Garak talk to Jomat. She remembers Rugal well, because his case was very unusual. Bajorans usually brought in the Cardassian children from the streets, but Rugal was turned in by a female [[Cardassian military]] officer who was attached to Terok Nor and, also unusually, knew his name. Garak helps the doctor put together the last pieces, and they go to the hearing.  With Sisko's permission, Bashir asks several questions. He gets O'Brien to reiterate the humiliation Pa'Dar is feeling, and when asked, Pa'Dar says it will be the end of his career when it is revealed to the people. Not only that, but the timing is very bad, considering there is an inquiry about to begin concerning the Cardassians' involvement in [[The Siege (episode)|the recent]] attempted military ''coup'' on Bajor. It just so happens that Dukat is one of the key witnesses in that inquiry.  Dukat objects, and says it is irrelevant. Bashir quickly changes his line of questioning, and asks Dukat if he has ever been to the orphanage center where Rugal was adopted. He says no. That center, he explains, is located where Pa'Dar was living eight years ago. Rugal was brought in by a female Cardassian military officer, who seemed to know the child... perhaps she also knew that he wasn't an orphan. When Dukat says he knows nothing about that, Bashir points out that the officer was attached to Terok Nor, which was [[Deep Space 9]]'s original designation under the Cardassians. The question for Dukat was: who was the commanding officer of Terok Nor eight years ago? Dukat walks out; he ''was'' that commanding officer.  :""''Station log, stardate 47178.3. After long and difficult deliberations, I have decided to allow Pa'Dar to take his son back to Cardassia. Although I am convinced his Bajoran [[foster parent]]s treated him with love, Rugal has been the clear victim in this conspiracy. I believe it's time for his healing to begin.''""  Pa'Dar thanks Sisko for salvaging his political career; Dukat will not make these events public, so this is a stalemate instead of a great loss. With a few words of encouragement from Miles O'Brien, Rugal goes with his father, hesitant, but willing. When the doctor asks Garak why he helped to defeat Dukat, he is evasive, as usual. If you can find all the details, he says, you can put it together yourself.   "
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0," ==Summary== ===Teaser=== [[Tom Paris]], playing the inventor, barrels through [[Fair Haven]] on an old [[automobile]], wreaking havoc until a pile of barrels stops him. [[Seamus]], nearby, goes to see if he's all right and remarks on his having [[money]] to afford the automobile. Paris explains that he fell into some money with an [[inheritance]], which prompts Seamus to ask discreetly for a few [[shilling]]s. As Seamus leaves, Paris tells the computer to repair the holographic tire. Strangely, the sudden repair of the tire which Seamus witnesses and comes to a very simple conclusion: it is [[magic|black magic]].  ===Act One=== Drawing everyone at Sullivan's pub to him, Seamus tells everyone what he saw. Some of the townsfolk agree that Tom goes through town ""as if he built the place"", and his friends are shifty. Some of the townspeople are skeptical, including [[Doctor]] {{dis|Fitzgerald|hologram}} and barkeep [[Michael Sullivan]], since Seamus does typically ""add color"" to his stories, but it does unsettle them. He recites a legend about a similar town where spirit folk sneaked in, took advantage of their hospitality, and took all the people to the ""Otherworld."" The entire town vanished. When [[Kathryn Janeway|Katie O'Clare]] comes in, everyone stops talking and Sullivan hurriedly greets her, bringing her to the bar and dismissing the earlier conversation.   Meanwhile, elsewhere on the ship, [[Harry Kim]] replicates flowers for his date with Fair Haven holographic character [[Maggie O'Halloran]]. [[B'Elanna Torres]] complains about her technical difficulties with the program, as the open door policy in place means it is now running constantly, while Paris decides to make Kim's date a little more interesting. On the holodeck he follows Kim and [[Maggie O'Halloran]] from a distance. Unbeknownst to him, however, Seamus and {{dis|Milo|hologram}} are following Paris, determined to prove he is a [[demon]]. As Kim goes to kiss the girl, Paris takes out a [[PADD]] and reprograms Maggie into a cow, shocking Kim, Seamus and Milo. As Kim argues with Paris, they are ordered to the [[bridge]] soon after. Seamus and Milo also hear the the order, and, scared, are convinced there's magic involved.  ===Act Two=== That night, {{dis|Father|title}} [[Mulligan]] ([[The Doctor]]) gives a sermon about harmony, and the evils of retribution. When he begins to get to his climax, Seamus and Milo barge in with the cow which used to be Maggie. Mulligan disbelieves them when they explain the situation. They point out that it was the trickery of Paris and Kim. The Doctor reassures them that it was just a prank, and he saw Maggie this morning. He ends [[mass]] and kicks them out, keeping the cow with him.  Seamus and Milo do find Maggie outside, who appears just before they get there. She doesn't seem herself, as she had a dream without remembering going to sleep. She doesn't remember anything about last night, but remembers walking around town with a bell around her neck, showing up at church, and everyone staring at her. She was tending her flowers just as they walked up.  They return to the bar, and more people start telling stories, of how Kim and Paris can change the weather, a daughter who fell in a well reappearing in the meadows, and Father Mulligan disappearing after service one night. Sullivan puts a stop to it, saying that there is nothing they can do; they can't just shoot everyone they suspect, since they are their neighbors. He wants them to go about the situation like civilized people.  Later, when Sullivan is alone with Katie O'Clare, he hands her a copy of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', suggesting that the townsfolk are wondering about strange things happening. He even did some checking, and there is no one who knows her (supposed) point of origin. He wants to know where she goes when she leaves and more about her to put his thoughts at ease. She admits she hasn't been honest, but not about anything important. She tries to explain that there are things he just cannot understand, but he wants to know. She doesn't know what to say, so she ends the program.  ===Act Three=== Janeway demands to know what Paris did with the program. He says nothing he did should result in that. Torres shuts the program down so she can make system repairs, and Paris and Kim begin to examine the character parameters. When they call up Michael Sullivan's character, instead of his image, the entire character comes to life, now in the hololab and sees them wearing their uniforms. He demands to know where he is, but they calm him down. They identify the subroutines which make him oblivious to things outside the program, and those subroutines are offline. They attempt to restore them, and as he realizes something is off-kilter, he pretends to appear to think nothing is out of the ordinary instantly (as the subroutines still don't go into effect). But when they find a way to restore all of the other characters at once, it is clear from his facial expression &ndash; which they miss &ndash; he was pretending to be complacent. Paris and Kim decide, rather than fix the characters one at a time in the lab, to head to the holodeck and use the holographic control panel in the pub to reset everyone at once. They then transfer Michael back to the pub, who immediately calls Fitzgerald into the church.  Only later do Paris and Kim figure out they failed, and plan to reset him along with everyone else. Janeway argues with [[Chakotay]] about what to do if they can't fix Michael. He suggests she get creative.  Sullivan, meanwhile, tells Fitzgerald an incredible story: he was taken to another world, and they were saying things about changing people and talking like he wasn't even there. Knowing that Paris and Kim will be heading to the pub to do something to all of them, they decide to hide there and be prepared to stop them. While Kim and Paris sneak into the pub to do it, the town gathers to discuss strategy. Some want to use rifles, some want to use books, some want to use rowan berries and red thread. Sullivan doesn't like it, but he is drowned out by Seamus. They head right over to the pub, and catch them in a red thread net, and when they see the control panel, they shoot it repeatedly to dispel the voice from the other world. This damages the holographic controls as well as disabling the the [[safety protocol]]s. When Paris orders the computer to freeze the program, only half the characters freeze due to the damage, and the other half chase them. When Paris and Kim can't pause the program or call up an exit, they capture them and hold them in the church.  ===Act Four=== In the ready room, the rest of the senior staff discuss what to do. [[Transporter]]s can't get a lock, they don't want to shut down the program or they'll lose it, and armed conflict would risk the lives of their security personnel. Instead, Janeway decides to send in The Doctor who can attach pattern enhancers to Paris and Kim to retrieve them.  Meanwhile, the exorcisms of Paris and Kim, tied up with red twine and having incantations shouted, isn't going very well. When they are discussing lynching, The Doctor bursts in and condemns them all as 'sinners'. They ignore him, pointing out he vanished after his sermon, and tie him up with the others. They take away the transport enhancers, and The Doctor's [[mobile emitter]], tying him into the same grid. On the bridge, the crew detect that The Doctor is now in the program, and can't isolate him.  Seamus continues to use incantations to get more information. He also tries [[hypnosis]], which, oddly, works on The Doctor. They learn from him that there is a ship called ''Voyager''. They ignore it as nonsense, but Sullivan believes Katie is there and he asks The Doctor how to get there, having come back once before. The Doctor suggests the mobile emitter, and when [[Tuvok]] beams it to the bridge without looking, Janeway is astonished to see Sullivan materialize. He is more astonished than she is.   ===Act Five=== Janeway is forced to explain everything as she feels she has no choice. She explains that ''Voyager'' has technology allowing them to travel back in time, like [[H.G. Wells]] (although she doesn't mention that Fair Haven and all its inhabitants are just holograms), and that many members of the crew he recognizes just visit Fair Haven because they are explorers.  As Sullivan begins to understand, and slowly come to terms with the [[starship]], Tuvok announces through the comm that the townspeople have started piling kindling. She returns to the holodeck program with Sullivan, and she explains to the townspeople that they use technology, not magic, and they do not wish to destroy their town. In fact, Sullivan points out that they helped the town by creating clear days and saving children (turning Maggie into a cow excepted, which Paris promises not to do again). Sullivan convinces them not to turn their backs on these people, and everyone cools down.  Torres once again complains about the limits of holographic technology, saying they will have to limit the time the program runs. Janeway regretfully accepts this fact, but with her last short time in the program, finds that everything is back to normal, with holographic and flesh and blood characters, more or less.  "

==Summary==
===Introduction===
Cmdr. [[Susan Ivanova]] is in [[C&C]] overseeing the departure of the last of the shuttles containing known [[Nightwatch]] personnel. Capt. [[John Sheridan]] enters and Ivanova relays that fact, although Security Chief [[Michael Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] is still seeking out hidden agents. Also on the shuttles are other civilians not wishing to stay on the station. Garibaldi walks in, his arm in a sling, claiming it was additional injuries he received during the previous battle. Garibaldi reports that the station is eerily quiet. Everyone is still stunned at the present turn of events: [[Morgan Clark|Clark]]'s forces attacking the station, [[Babylon 5]] declaring independence, etc. The primary complaint, however, is the continuing lockdown of comm channels. Sheridan has kept them down to prevent [[Earth Central]] from trying to hack into the station's computers. 

Garibaldi then reveals that he has kept copies of the master access codes, meaning they can reset the system themselves. Garibaldi then notes that Sheridan is out of uniform; Sheridan says he won't wear the [[Earthforce]] uniform because it represents the very thing they are fighting right now: the Clark regime. However, he does concede he will be in full dress uniform later, but for the last time. Sheridan decides to make rounds. Garibaldi is against it since any Clark-loyalist in hiding would see Sheridan as a high-value target, but Sheridan counters that the presence of the station's CO is needed to help reassure the people on the station.

Meanwhile, Ambassador [[Delenn]] is meeting with certain members of the [[Sharlin-class warcruiser]]s that had accompanied her to Babylon 5 to defend the station. She expresses her thanks and tells them that their actions would be remembered with reverence. As they leave, [[Lennier]] relays a request. Fleet Captain [[Lennan]] wishes to tour the station personally. She agrees to perform the tour herself. Then she asks Lennier how he personally feels about the dramatic action she has taken in the preceding days. Lennier continues to defer to prophecy, but Delenn counters that, ""''prophecy is a poor guide to the future''"" since one doesn't know the real meaning of it until it has already happened and since not all prophecies are good ones. The road ahead will be treacherous with no guarantee they'll survive it.

As Sheridan walks through the [[Zócalo]], someone else observes him with keen interest...through a telescopic sight.

===Act I===
Before the marksman can take the shot, however, he is stopped by another man. The marksman protests he has a clear shot, but the other retorts that the timing is wrong. Killing Sheridan now would only martyr him and give rise to another. They need to do this the right way.

[[Marcus Cole]] returns to the station, greeting Delenn and Lennier. When she points out that Earth will be reluctant to attack Babylon 5 now that it has Minbari protection, Marcus says that he's not loyal to Earth, who he saw as nothing more than a parasite. Still, this breaking away from Earth has given Delenn an idea. She wants to call for the [[Nafak'cha]]: the Rebirth Ceremony. Marcus notes that now wouldn't be a good time, as the people on the station had their own affairs to attend.

One of those affairs is the military funeral service for the soldiers lost in the battle for the station. Sheridan (as he agreed, in full dress uniform) along with the rest of the command staff, solemnly salute their names and their sacrifices as, escorted by [[Starfury|Starfuries]], spaceborne coffins carrying each of the fallen depart the station to be committed to [[Epsilon Eridani]].

Lord [[Antono Refa]] finds Ambassador [[Londo Mollari]] waiting for him in the Zócalo. Londo offers a drink as Refa sits down and testily asks the reason for being summoned. Londo starts by noting the many different front ''lines'' (emphasis on the plural) the Centauri currently seem to be engaged. While Refa points out the Centauri are bristling to expand, Londo counters that two fronts is bad enough &ndash; ''twelve ''is sheer insanity. Refa coyly counters they can handle it, but Londo sees through the bravado. He knows Refa thinks that with Mr. [[Morden]] and the [[Shadows]] backing him, they can't lose. And to prove he knows about Refa's association, he plays back part of a conversation Morden had with him. Londo expresses his deep concern for Morden's allies. He fears they'll turn on [[Centauri Prime]] one day, especially with Centauri forces as disorganized as they are now. 

Mollari insists that Refa break off from Morden immediately. When Refa demands to know why he should remove himself from such powerful allies, Londo gives three reasons: propriety, patriotism, and ''poison''. Refa's drink was laced with the first part of a bipartite poison. Now in his system, it can lay dormant for years, meaning at any time, Londo can deliver the other part of the poison and kill him. Londo promises to do that unless Refa breaks off from Morden, coyly pointing out that his little treachery was a nod back to the ""good old days"" of the Republic as well as a way to steal a march on Refa, who he felt would've done the same to him given the chance.

At his station, Garibaldi inputs the master access codes and waits for Sheridan and Ivanova, Commanding and First Officers, to give their passwords. Garibaldi, as Chief Security Officer, adds his password and then requests a fresh set of security passwords and a full system restart. Just then, Delenn walks in and asks for Sheridan. Since the essentials were already complete, he leaves with her. As he leaves, Ivanova pokes fun at Garibaldi for using ""''peekaboo''"" as a password, but he counters, ""''Would you have guessed it?''""

In the hall, Delenn explains the Rebirth Ceremony. She feels a ceremony or renewal would be just the thing to encourage the people on board. She intends to invite the command staff and many of the ambassadors on board, including Londo and G'Kar (who she points out need the ceremony more than anyone else, in hopes of burying past grudges).

In an unknown part of the station, the remaining members of Nightwatch convene to listen to orders from Earth concerning how to proceed. The plan is to use Delenn to force the Minbari escorts to withdraw, opening the way for Clark loyalists to retake the station. Though one of them (the marksman from earlier) points out that killing her would not be advised (since a similar death triggered the tragic [[Earth-Minbari War]], which Earth barely survived), but the idea is to pin the blame on Sheridan. The marksman starts recounting how he tortured Minbari to death. It is clear he still holds a grudge against them and sees the plan as a measure of revenge.

===Act II===
Delenn seeks out Marcus in a [[Downbelow]] bar. She wants to invite Marcus to the Rebirth Ceremony, but he claims to be too busy and excuses himself before she can press further.

Back in Security, Garibaldi resets the main computer. There is a tense pause as the system reboots, but what happens next puzzles him and Ivanova. The computer doesn't respond in it usual clinical efficiency. Instead, a personality appears to inhabit the computer: a sassy and snappy one that doesn't always obey. Garibaldi then recalls that the computer had an AI installed prior to going online, but it had been turned off because, like now, it talked back. The reboot had unintentionally restarted the AI.

Delenn seems to be having more trouble getting people to attend the Rebirth Ceremony. While Londo asks for more detail from Delenn, he realizes the ceremony is not like how Centauri like to celebrate religion (which usually involves drinking and debauchery). He also feels offended about others looking into his personal affairs: affairs he would much rather attend himself. As for [[G'Kar]], he appears to be too busy organizing the Narns who are now part of station security. Marcus notes that his sentiment about the ceremony is not isolated, but Delenn stands firm. Then Lennier reminds her about Lennan. She insists on having Marcus accompany her rather than Lennier

The reason is shown as they proceed to the docking bay. She keeps pressing Marcus about why he doesn't like the Rebirth Ceremony. Marcus notes that the ceremony involves giving something up, and he has very little left to give. His home is gone, and all his worldly possessions are on his person. He also blames himself for the loss of everything he had since he didin't heed his brother's warnings about the Shadows. Indeed, it was in memory of his brother that he joined the [[Rangers]]. Then Delenn points out he ''does'' have something to give up: the memories he has for the loss of the [[Arisia Mining Colony]]. If he doesn't let go, they can prove dangerous, even tragic. But Marcus doesn't see it as a chain, and he walks away. The Minbari shuttle arrives. Delenn proceeds to greet Lennan, and it is at this point that Nightwatch strikes, taking both Delenn and Lennan hostage.

===Act III===
Back in Security, Garibaldi continues to try to remove the talkative and condescending AI. Just then, Ivanova reports in on the kidnapping of Delenn and Lennan. He immediately realizes it's Nightwatch.

In addition to Delenn and Lennan, one of Lennan's officers is in the secret Nightwatch base, injured. The marksman is completely unconcerned about his health, but even as he trains his [[PPG]] on her, Delenn claims she is unafraid as well. Soon, the leader returns to report the word of Delenn's capture is public. He also checks to see if a comm line is being scrambled on schedule. Because he announces it's time to go public.

In Sheridan's office, Marcus blames himself for leaving Delenn in her moment of vulnerability. Just then, Lt. [[David Corwin]] reports in with someone on another channel. Patching it through, the leader of the Nightwatch cell is revealed. Garibaldi recognizes the man as [[Boggs]]. Boggs keeps it straightforward. Return Babylon 5 to human control in six hours or the Minbaris die. And since they can monitor Security and the comm channels, they can't coordinate any attacks without them knowing. And just to show how serious they are, they kill the third Minbari. Marcus storms off, and Sheridan lets him go, knowing that he is heading Downbelow where he can seek the lines of contact they can't reach. Meanwhile, Sheridan wants the call itself analyzed for clues that scrambling can't hide.

Downbelow, Marcus jumps in on the syndicate's card game and gets right to the point. He wants to know anything about Delenn's whereabouts. He points out that if he doesn't get what he wants in five minutes, he'll be the only one at the table still standing. Five minutes after that, he'll be the only one at the ''bar'' still standing. Everyone just laughs then stands.

Delenn and Lennan try to communicate between themselves; unfortunately, the gunman can understand their speaking in Minbari and counters their actions. He points out that both are dying regardless of the outcome. Delenn then expresses pity over a man whose morality has been ground out of him. The gunman reacts angrily and attempts to shoot Delenn, but Lennan jumps in and knocks him down, diverting the shot. He tries to fight back, but the gunman shoots him, then is about to shoot Delenn before being stopped by Boggs, who reminds him they need to be alive until the deal is finished.

About ten minutes later, Marcus makes good on his threat but now has a problem: no one's conscious enough to tell him anything. Just then, someone approaches him from behind. Marcus motions to strike but stops when he realizes it's Lennier. Lennier comments on the violence but Marcus notes that it helped him vent some long-repressed aggression. Strangely, though, Lennier has come as part of the Rebirth Ceremony. Part of the ceremony requires that one confess a hidden secret to another. In this case, Lennier is confessing his love for Delenn.

===Act IV===
For once, Marcus is intrigued. Lennier continues his confession, explaining that his is a love that is hard to place into words since it is not the kind of love humans normally associate. And it is a love that recognizes that Delenn's destiny falls with another. Just then, someone wakes up, and Marcus quickly grills him, and he finally gets the needed information.

Back in Sheridan's office, Ivanova reports that an analysis of the audio signal picked up a recurring noise in the background. Garibaldi recognizes the noise as coming from the reactor coolant systems, meaning the room is in [[Grey Sector]]. Just then, Marcus appears revealing that his contacts had supplied parts to individuals trying to get it to a Level 14-and that one of the Security force is secretly a member of [[Nightwatch]]. Ivanova puts them together and calls up a map of Grey 14. They discover that part of the level is secured: supposedly by Garibaldi. They realize that's the room, but they have a problem. With only one way in or out, they can't barge in. They need another way. Garibaldi decides to assemble a small team of trustworthy Security personnel, and Marcus gives info on the Security guard interested in Grey 14. Sheridan formulates a plan... ''to surrender''.

In the room, Boggs wonder if Sheridan will accede to the demand as time runs out, but then his Nightwatch contact calls in to relay an image: the Minbari cruisers leaving. Boggs is thrilled: he gives the order to send a coded signal to Earth, who are waiting to storm the station. Just then, there is the sound of an explosion and the lights dim for a moment. There is a commotion outside. When Boggs investigates, he learns that the reactor coolant system is leaking. The level is no longer safe, so they're forced to leave: taking Delenn and Lennan with them.

As they enter a corridor, they are suddenly assailed with PPG fire from various angles as Security ambushes them. Several members of Security are shot down, but a shot from Ivanova takes out Boggs. Garibaldi shoots down another gunman, and Sheridan wounds Boggs' triggerman. Well-aimed shots take out the Nightwatch holding Delenn and Lennan. As Sheridan checks on the downed Nightwatch, the triggerman draws a knife and tries to attack Sheridan. Delenn rushes to him and takes the thrown knife in the back. Enraged, Sheridan pursues him down a hallway and finally catches up to him, tackling him and then punching him mercilessly: his rage at Nightwatch boiling over until one final punch knocks the triggerman unconscious.

===Act V===
Later, Lennier reports that the knife was stopped by Delenn's ribs and thus it missed any vital organs. She will recover, but not in time for the Rebirth Ceremony.

Meanwhile, Garibaldi is getting fed up with the AI. Removal won't be complete until midnight, so he continues to endure its condescending voice. Finally, in a fit of frustration, he shoots out a speaker with his PPG.

In [[Medlab]], Delenn requests Lennier to rest, but he won't until the time is right. Just then, Sheridan appears, carrying his uniform. He's come to the decision that if the Rebirth Ceremony must take place at a certain time, why not here and now. Learning from Lennier about the need to sacrifice something precious and confess a deep secret as part of the ceremony, Sheridan offers his Earthforce uniform (and everything it symbolizes) and, for the first time, openly confesses his love for her. One by one, others of the command staff enter, each one offering their Earthforce uniform and a secret. Garibaldi admits his fear of losing control of his emotions. Ivanova admits, despite her distrust of [[Psi Corps]], she had developed romantic feelings for the (assumed now-deceased) telepath [[Talia Winters]]. Franklin confessed his [[stims]] addiction.

As they leave, Lennier reveals that their actions had been somewhat anticipated and that they would find something waiting for them in their quarters.

Later, the people in C&C look up in surprise as the command staff enter with the gifts Delenn had provided: brand new uniforms to signify their independence. Sheridan notes that now they and the station are reborn and back in business.

These telepathic [[historian]]s conduct their research by retrieving long-forgotten memories.''""  Three Ullians, [[Inad]], [[Tarmin]], and Tarmin's son [[Jev]], have come on board the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-D|-D}}. Interviewing [[Keiko O'Brien]] in [[Ten Forward]], Tarmin probes her memory of a cup, which she knows is important but whose context she cannot recollect. With his help, Keiko remembers bit by bit that it was used by her ''[[obachan]]'' to wash brushes used in [[Japanese]] [[calligraphy]]. She thanks the Ullians for the retrieval of the pleasant memory. Tarmin attempts to persuade [[Dr.]] [[Beverly Crusher|Crusher]] to undergo the probe but is reminded by Jev that they are not to probe people without permission.  ===Act One=== [[Data]] and [[Geordi La Forge]] discuss the nature of memory while walking together in a [[corridor]]. Data is puzzled over the importance of the Ullians' ability to retrieve memory, as he believes that if an event is important, it should not be forgotten. La Forge tells him that it is not that simple for Humans, as they cannot recall certain memories in an instant. As an example, he tells Data that he cannot even remember what he did on his last [[birthday]]. Data notes that perhaps Humans choose to only remember their good memories and disregard the bad ones. La Forge responds that it does not work that way, as bad memories usually are the most intense of all. Upon exiting the [[turbolift]] they are in, Data remarks that there seems to be no predictable pattern to Human memory.  Later, at a dinner for the Ullians with the [[senior staff]], Tarmin describes the Ullians' project to build an archive of memories from many worlds, calling his group ""[[archaeologist]]s of the mind."" However, he is stymied by the staff's refusal to undergo the procedure. He embarrasses his son with an anecdote of quickly retrieving a memory that Jev could not. Piqued, Jev leaves the dinner. [[Counselor]] [[Deanna Troi|Troi]] follows him, and sympathizes with him about having an [[Lwaxana Troi|overbearing parent]]. She then returns to her quarters. But while getting ready for bed, she has flashes of memory about a romantic encounter she had with [[Commander]] [[William T. Riker|Riker]]. She gets a [[hot chocolate]] from her [[replicator]] to try to calm down. The memory turns unpleasant however, when he begins to force himself on her &ndash; and then turns into Jev, who also appears elsewhere in the room. She then falls into a [[coma]].  ===Act Two===  :""''Captain's log, Stardate 45430.9. Counselor Troi has fallen into a deep coma. After a thorough examination, Dr. Crusher has been unable to find signs of illness or infection.''""  In [[sickbay]], Dr. Crusher and Dr. {{dis|Martin|Doctor}} are examining Troi and bringing Riker and [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] up to date on her condition. They cannot identify the cause of the coma, standard revival techniques have failed, and Dr. Crusher does not want to attempt anything else without identifying the cause. Picard asks who the last person was to speak to Troi before she fell into her coma. Riker tells him she left the dinner with one of the Ullians and he will go and talk to him. Before he leaves, Picard also asks Riker if he would request that the Ullians consent to an examination.  Riker goes to speak with Jev in Ten Forward, who reacts with a certain hostility to the questions Riker poses regarding his whereabouts and the speculations about an Ullian cause for the coma. But he agrees to an examination.   Riker goes to sickbay to see Troi and speaks with her, hoping she can hear him despite the coma. He remembers that she [[Shades of Gray (episode)|did the same for him when he was in bad shape]]. He is exhausted and emotional; Dr. Crusher tells him it's late and to get some sleep. Back in his quarters, he, like Deanna, experiences flashes of memory. He is in [[main engineering]] during a [[Warp core breach|containment breach]]; he must order the closure of the [[isolation door|emergency door]], trapping [[Ensign]] [[Keller]] inside. A colleague of hers angrily accuses him of killing her; this officer turns into Jev. When Picard tries to contact Riker, he does not respond; [[Worf]] goes to investigate, he enters Riker's quarters and finds him unconscious, lying face down on his table.  ===Act Three=== :""''Medical log, Stardate 45431.7. Commander Riker is the second officer who has fallen into an unexplained coma. I have examined the Ullians and ruled out the possibility that they are carrying a harmful organism.''""  Crusher has found an [[electropathic residue]] in the [[thalamus]] &ndash; the memory center &ndash; of both Troi and Riker. This suggests [[Iresine syndrome]], but that condition is ruled out because the two patients are not showing decreased [[histamine]] levels. Worf suggests quarantining the Ullians, but Picard says no.   When spoken to by Picard, Tarmin reacts with shock to the notion that the Ullians could cause the comas. Inad, however, agrees to such monitoring for the next morning. In the meantime, Dr. Crusher and Dr. Martin scan Keiko, who does not show any unusual signs, not even the electropathic residue that the others present; and La Forge searches for agents that can cause electropathic residue, finding nothing aboard the ''Enterprise''.   Crusher continues to research Iresine syndrome in her office; but as she works, she experiences the same memory flashes. In her case, she sees a younger Picard accompanying her in a [[morgue]] at [[Starbase 32]] to see the body of her husband [[Jack R. Crusher|Jack]]. Picard turns into Jev, as does Jack &ndash; horrifyingly opening his eyes. In fear, she turns to Picard, who is also Jev; and lets out a frantic scream.  ===Act Four=== When La Forge and Data come to deliver La Forge's report to Crusher, they find her in a coma. La Forge rushes to check on her while Data signals a medical emergency to her office.  As La Forge and Data report the incident to Captain Picard in his [[captain's ready room|ready room]], he orders Data to investigate the other planets that the Ullians have visited for unexplained comas. He also decides to restrict the Ullians to their quarters, though La Forge questions the effectiveness of this measure on telepaths. They are interrupted by the news that Troi has awakened. In sickbay, she reports that she cannot remember the circumstances of falling into the coma.  The Ullians react with irritation to being asked to stay in their quarters; even Inad reacts, asking for permission to help clear their name by conducting a memory search on Troi. Picard, despite his concern for exposing Troi to telepathy so soon after her ordeal, agrees but will discuss the request with Troi first.  Data and La Forge have not found any unexplained comas in their search; the [[Epsilon Nel system]] has yet to report. However, La Forge suggests seeking cases of Iresine syndrome, thinking that it might have been [[diagnosis|misdiagnosed]]. Indeed, two cases of Iresine syndrome turn up on [[Hurada III]] while the Ullians were present.  Troi agrees to the memory search, which Jev conducts. She revisits the memory that provoked her coma &ndash; but this time, Jev is replaced in her memory by Tarmin.  ===Act Five=== :""''Captain's log, Stardate 45433.2. We have set a course for [[Starbase 440]] where the Ullians will disembark and return home.''""  Jev apologizes to Picard for Tarmin's behavior and offers the full support of the Ullian legal system. Although Picard says the Federation has no law against [[telepathic memory invasion]], the Ullians do and the penalty is severe, even though the practice has been unheard of for centuries. Picard notes that Tarmin is strenuously maintaining his innocence.   Meanwhile, Data and La Forge receive a transmission from the Nel system, reporting unexplained comas. Tarmin is cleared when they discover that he was on the Ullian homeworld at the time, between Stardates 45321 and 45323.    Jev goes to visit Troi in her quarters to apologize. As he does so, however, he begins to make alarming remarks about her beauty. Abruptly, she starts to have the flashes of her previous memory. She realizes it was actually him in the memory, not Tarmin, and fights back physically. He throws her across the room, but Worf, Data, [[Kellogg]] and another security officer burst in and overpower him. Data tells Troi they have discovered that Jev, not Tarmin, was the only Ullian present at all the incidents of coma. :""''Captain's log, Stardate 45435.8. Dr. Crusher and Commander Riker have regained consciousness while we were en route to the Ullian homeworld. A slow process of their recovery has begun.''""  The situation resolved, Tarmin promises the assistance of Ullian physicians, but warns that no incidences of this form of [[rape]] have occurred in over three hundred years, and these physicians might be somewhat out of practice. Tarmin himself is badly shaken by the thought that any Ullian, much less his own son, could have committed acts that have not been known since a dark time in Ullian history was resolved. Picard notes that, although [[Earth]] experienced such times and is now peaceful, it is important for both Humans and Ullians to recognize that the seed of violence remains within all of them. To forget that is to risk allowing such a seed to grow and consume them, as it did Jev.  "

== Summary ==
A [[Howard Prince|con man]] (Treat Williams) finds [[Effie Gluckman|a new wealthy widow]] (Frances Sternhagen) excited to have his company, but it seems that someone is on to him as he soon gets a series of notes warning him to stop on what he's doing or else risk facing the dire consequences.

Boxing legend Sugar Ray Leonard makes a cameo appearance as the gravedigger.

== Plot ==
[[Howard Prince]] is a con man who works with his partner, [[Morty]]. However, the two are on the brink of being arrested by the IRS for they are due in court for tax evasion, so the plan is for Howard to marry wealthy old women and kill them for their money. With the aid of [[Baxter]], a video dating service owner who is unaware of Howard's plans, he was able to find the most wealthy elderly women in the city. Howard wooed the widows [[Clair McCarthy|Clair]], [[Elizabeth Swathmore|Elizabeth]], and [[Matilda Mason|Matilda]] in succession and married them -- then, one night, he gives the butler the night off and sets up a romantic dinner for two. The women have a glass of red wine, which Howard poisons as he didn't have a drink himself, the woman dies from a poison-induced heart attack, and Howard calls 911 at the last minute and pretends to be hysterical about his wife having a heart attack. He even justifies himself to Morty, saying that he is doing them a favor by killing them instead of just taking the money and leaving, for that would be cruel and unusual.

Howard's latest victim is a widow named [[Effie Gluckman]]. As he is trying to woo Effie, he repeatedly receives messages telling him to end his crime spree or face the consequences. The first message he gets, he feels like he is being set up by Morty, so Howard went into Morty's office as he was shredding incriminating papers, grabs Morty by the necktie and gets it caught in the paper shredder, snapping Morty's neck as the tie is being pulled by the paper shredder. The next day, after marrying Effie at City Hall, Howard gets a second message telling him to stop, so he thought Baxter caught on to his crime. He kills Baxter by grabbing him by the tie and throwing him head first into the television set, electrocuting him. That night, as he is preparing the fateful dinner for him and Effie, [[Stanhope]], Effie's butler, threatens Howard with a gun, saying that he knew about him being the widower of Clair, Elizabeth, and Matilda. Stanhope gives Howard a chance to leave and never come back, but Howard declines, attacks Stanhope before he could fire and snaps Stanhope's neck, military style.

Everything is going according to plan, but as Howard tries to call an ambulance to cover his tracks, he has to change his heart attack story when Effie wouldn't succumb to the poison, so he throws her down the staircase and tells the 911 operators that she fell down the stairs. Days after Effie's funeral, as he getting a plane ticket out of the country, he gets one more message on his door. There was still someone out there telling him to stop. Howard was told to meet the messenger at Effie's crypt, who turns out to be the grave digger himself. He tells Howard that he sent the messages warning him to stop, but before he could tell Howard who hired him, Howard grabbed the grave digger's shovel, saying there is a penalty for wasting his time, and he killed the grave digger with the shovel.

As Howard is about to put the gravedigger in Effie's coffin, he sees that it's empty. He then hears a voice and turns, seeing Effie, who had come back as a zombie. However, she isn't the only one who came back -- Matilda, Elizabeth, and Clair have risen from the dead as well, each woman's appearance worse than the last. Howard tries to escape, but he is surrounded. They say that they can't live or die without Howard, so in order to rest in peace, they all eat Howard alive.

== Summary ==
===Introduction===
As [[Sinclair]] and [[Garibaldi]] are eating breakfast, [[Ivanova]] joins them, complaining that [[C'n'C]] woke her up early because of some strange readings coming from [[Sector 14]], a location approximately three hours from the station. After they play a prank on her, she goes to C'n'C where [[Alpha 7]] has arrived at Sector 14.

At Sector 14, the pilot relays back to [[Babylon 5]] as he witnesses something that surprises him. Soon, he yells as he is then suddenly surrounded by light and the communication cuts out.

=== Act I ===
Ivanova tries to reach the pilot of Alpha 7, but to no avail, however, the Starfury is on a trajectory back to the station. Sinclair speculates that the pilot's communication system has failed, probably as a result of the continued tachyon emissions coming from Sector 14.

[[Delenn]], alone on a [[Minbari flyer]], leaves the station and enters the [[jumpgate]].

Alpha 7 finally arrives back at Babylon 5, however, it's confirmed no life signs detected. The ship is brought aboard and examined. Later, in Sinclair's office, Garibaldi explains that the pilot of Alpha 7 died of a natural cause: old age, despite only being thirty. He apparently programmed the fighter to return on autopilot just before he died. Garibaldi has already ordered his team to begin investigating. A short time later, Garibaldi shows Sinclair and Ivanova the pilot's safety buckle: ""B4"" is scratched onto the surface. Sinclair mentions that the tachyon emissions from Sector 14 are coming from the exact place [[Babylon 4]] disappeared four years earlier.

Meanwhile, Delenn exits a jumpgate and starts a journey.

Just then, C'n'C contacts Sinclair to tell him that they are receiving a distress call &ndash; from [[Babylon 4]]. They rush to C'n'C, where after confirming the station's ID code, they receive the call from the Commander of B4, Major [[Krantz]]. He tells them that the station is damaged and they need assistance in evacuating the skeleton crew. Then the signal disappears. Ivanova tells Sinclair that the message was time-stamped four years ago &ndash; the time that B4 disappeared. Sinclair orders teams prepared immediately to begin a rescue mission, which should take about 10 hours.

=== Act II ===
Sinclair warns the pilots that this is a very dangerous and unpredictable mission, and that it is strictly a volunteer assignment. No one asks to leave. Sinclair and Garibaldi also take a ship to Sector 14 to lead the rescue effort. He orders Ivanova not to send any other ships.

On the Minbari flyer, Delenn flies into a Minbari [[Sharlin class warcruiser]]. Delenn joins the other members of the [[Grey Council]] with a customary greeting. She is welcomed, and informed that she has been chosen to lead the Minbari, taking [[Dukhat]]'s place. She is surprised and does not want to leave Babylon 5, mentioning the expected prophecy. They tell her that ""prophecy will attend to itself,"" and that she will be staying with the Council.

As the Earthforce ships approach Sector 14, Sinclair and Garibaldi see for themselves &ndash; Babylon 4 appears in front of them.

===Act III===
The first shuttles fly toward Babylon 4, passing through a distortion field, and safely land.

Sinclair and Garibaldi enter Babylon 4, telling the other pilots to stay back, until it is shown to be safe. They are fired upon by a raving crewman. He is subdued by Garibaldi, and Major Krantz, assigned to supervise construction of Babylon 4, greets them. Sinclair tells him about Babylon 5, and when Garibaldi tells him that the year is [[2258]], he is shocked, but not surprised. He warns they must leave immediately. Suddenly there is a flash of light, and Sinclair finds himself in the middle of a firefight on the station, not sure what is going on. He is next to Garibaldi, who IS aware of the situation. This Garibaldi is dressed in riot gear and wielding a machine gun. He tells Sinclair that he has rigged the fusion reactors to explode and yells for Sinclair to leave without him. After another flash, Sinclair is back on Babylon 4. Krantz explains that it is a flash through time: people experience something from either their past or future, and it is different for everyone. He again tells them that they need to leave.

Delenn talks to another member of the Council, saying she cannot go back into the Great Hall, because once she enters, she will never leave again. She feels she needs to return to Babylon 5. She demands to reconvene the Council, and he agrees.

As the evacuation on B4 continues, Krantz tells Sinclair that the problems started 24 hours after going online. They noticed problems with time track system, then ""all hell broke loose."" He also shows them [[Zathras]], an alien that they found on the ship, that is being held in Security. Zathras immediately brightens when he sees Sinclair, seemingly recognizing him, but then seems to think better of it and refuses to talk. Krantz tells them that Zathras just showed up in the conference room during a flash. Sinclair asks what he is doing there. When Garibaldi threatens to hurt him, Zathras begins to talk. He explains that he and those with him have come to steal the station, moving it through time to a place where it can serve as a base of operations in a great and terrible war. He mentions that he is following a figure called ""the One,"" a person he would willingly die for. Zathras says the One is hurt and that he must help him.

The interrogation is interrupted when a security guard alerts Krantz to a situation. Everyone leaves, including Zathras, who rushes out of the room before the guards can restrain him. In a nearby corridor, a figure in a spacesuit materializes out of thin air. When Zathras sees her, he declares her ""the One.""

=== Act IV ===
The figure in the spacesuit is clearly in pain. Zathras explains that ""the One"" was willing to endure the pain &ndash; it is a consequence of her stopping the station where and when they did (i.e. 2258) to allow the crew to evacuate. Sinclair approaches the figure, and when he touches her, he is thrown across the room. Zathras rushes over to the figure, quickly handing her an object he claims he has fixed. The mysterious figure vanishes.

Zathras attempts to run away, but is quickly recaptured. He tells them that they must leave immediately, or else they will be trapped forever. Despite this, Zathras is taken back to the interrogation room.

Delenn, now reunited with the Grey Council, tells them that she must return to Babylon 5, because she has not finished her work with the humans. She is confident that the prophesy was indeed about the humans, and talks about their need to community, fight, and independence. They warn her that if she leaves, she may never return, may even become an outcast. She insists on staying on Babylon 5, and by a 5-4 vote, they withdraw their decision and allow her to return.

As Garibaldi struggles to get the panicked mob onto shuttles in an orderly fashion, Sinclair asks Zathras what he gave the figure. He tells Sinclair it is a time stabilizer, and that it was his (Zathras'), and that without it, Zathras will die. Sinclair realizes that the time distortions are what killed his pilot.

Garibaldi calls Sinclair to tell him that almost everyone is off, and that they need to leave. Suddenly a time flash happens, and Michael is in a room with [[Lise Hampton]]. He is at the moment in time where he was ready to leave her to go to Babylon 5, and experiences her anger at him all over again. The moment passes and Garibaldi is even more resolved to leave immediately.

Krantz insists that they take Zathras with them, despite what the alien says. As they are leaving, however, a tremor rocks the station and a column lands on Zathras, pinning him underneath it. Sinclair does not want to leave him, but Zathras insists, telling him that he ""has a destiny."" Sinclair leaves, and Zathras is soon joined by the space suited figure. Zathras is delighted, telling him that he knew he would not leave him, and that he trusts The One. Sinclair, Garibaldi, and the last of their ships manage to clear the station, just as it disappears.

As Babylon 4 moves through time, a figure who looks the same as the figure takes off his helmet, revealing that he is Sinclair, only much older. Talking to someone off screen he says that he ""tried to warn them, but it all happened, just the way I remembered."" A woman (off screen) speaks to him saying, ""I know. It's time. We have to go. They're waiting for us."" The woman sounds like Delenn.

As they are leaving the area, Garibaldi asks Sinclair if he believes the story Zathras told him. He tells Michael that it is, that he hopes Babylon 4 helps them with their cause.

=== Act V ===
Delenn is ready to leave the ship, when her Minbari friend comes to tell her goodbye. She tells him that she realizes she will never see the Inner Chamber of the Grey Council. He hands her a [[triluminary]], a triangular-shaped object. She objects, but he insists, acknowledging that if she is correct about the prophecies than she will have need of it soon. He admits he feels large changes coming himself, but can't know much about it for sure. She bids him a friendly good-bye.

Back on Babylon 5, Ivanova tells Sinclair she is upset that she missed the excitement. Sinclair reminds her that they do not know when the ship will return. She tells him that if it does return, that ""I'm going, and Garibaldi is staying here.""

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"== Summary == === Teaser === A lone female pilot in an [[Kobali shuttle|alien shuttle]] is pursued by a [[Kobali starship|larger vessel]] of the same origin. She manages to disable the pursuing ship, and, in an [[Kobali language|alien language]], asks the shuttle's computer to locate the {{USS|Voyager}}. In [[English language|English]], she hails the [[Federation]] [[starship]].  === Act One === [[Mezoti]], one of the four [[Borg]] children recently rescued by ''Voyager'', has wandered into the [[astrometrics]] lab and intercepts the alien woman's transmission. Mezoti identifies herself by name, age, and [[Borg designations|species designation]], and asks the woman her species. The alien responds that it is a complicated answer and asks to speak to [[Captain]] [[Kathryn Janeway]]. Mezoti attempts to connect her, but is too short to reach the necessary controls and inadvertently ends the transmission when she leans on the lower panel.  [[Tuvok]] discovers Mezoti and reminds her that she's in a restricted area. He says he won't inform the captain but warns Mezoti not to enter the area again. [[Seven of Nine]] enters with the other three Borg children &ndash; [[Icheb]], [[Azan]], and [[Rebi]] &ndash; and berates Mezoti for not following her instructions to wait in the [[cargo bay]]. Tuvok asks Seven why she left the children unattended, and she responds that [[Chief Engineer]] [[B'Elanna Torres]] needed her assistance; she was gone for less than ten minutes. Seven admits to Tuvok that she is having difficulty controlling the unpredictable Borg children. Tuvok starts to offer advice, but is interrupted when Seven notices Mezoti at the communications station, trying to talk to ""the woman transmitting from spatial [[Grid 2369]].""  Tuvok hails the vessel. The alien recognizes his voice and says she's glad to hear him again. She reiterates her request to speak with Captain Janeway.  On the viewscreen of ''Voyager''{{'}}s bridge, the alien tells the captain she's a sight for sore eyes and warmly greets [[Harry Kim]]. Perplexed, the captain asks who she is, and is not amused when the alien identifies herself as [[Ensign]] [[Lyndsay Ballard]], a ''Voyager'' engineering officer who died almost three years earlier on an [[away mission]]. The alien understands the crew's skepticism and offers limited proof of her identity by naming the exact [[stardate]] of Ballard's death. She asks permission to beam aboard so that she can explain herself more fully.  Janeway agrees to beam the alien to [[sickbay]], behind a level 10 [[force field]]. Kim asks to accompany the captain to sickbay. He says he and Ballard were close and if somehow, this alien ''is'' Ballard, he will know.  In sickbay, [[The Doctor]] examines the alien as she recounts the circumstances of Ensign Ballard's death. Three years earlier, Ballard and Kim had traveled to a [[class M]] planet in the [[Vyntadi Expanse]] to mine [[dilithium]] [[ore]]. This planet, however, was a trap set by a [[Hirogen]] hunting party, who had reconfigured a [[power cell]] to emit false dilithium readings. Ten feet from [[Voyager shuttle unnamed 007|their shuttle]], Ballard was hit by a [[neural disruptor]] and died. Kim confirms the alien's account, and says that he buried Ballard in space.  The alien reveals that she next remembers waking up in a [[stasis chamber]], surrounded by aliens, the [[Kobali]], who had reanimated her. She didn't believe she had died until the Kobali showed Ballard visual scans of her corpse in the torpedo casing in which she was buried. The Kobali, who procreate by salvaging dead bodies, spent months altering Ballard's [[DNA]]. She wanted to contact ''Voyager'', but the Kobali refused her requests, saying that her former relationships were part of her ''[[Kobali language|kyn'steya]]'', or past life. They tried to make her forget ''Voyager'' and sent her to live with a Kobali family. She spent two years deceiving them into believing she had accepted her new life before eventually stealing the shuttle and spending the next six months searching for ''Voyager.''  The Doctor confirms that the alien's remaining Human DNA matches that of Ensign Ballard. With no valid reason to disbelieve her story, the captain drops the force field and welcomes Ballard home. As Janeway and The Doctor excuse themselves, Kim has an emotional reunion with his former crewmate, who says that she missed him, too.  === Act Two === In the conference room, ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[senior crew]] welcomes Ballard back to the ship. The captain calls her a fine officer, [[Neelix]] and [[Tom Paris]] have retrieved her personal items from storage, and Torres tells her that her old shift in engineering awaits when she's ready. A short discussion ensues on preparing the ship in the event that the Kobali attack ''Voyager'' in an effort to retrieve Ballard. As the briefing ends, Ballard lags behind to thank the captain privately for the compliments she gave. Ballard admits she previously didn't think the captain had noticed her.  Ballard and Kim reminisce, and she tells him that while she was away she made a list of things she would do if she ever made it back to ''Voyager'', including No. 26: hear him play music again.  In the [[mess hall]], Neelix has set up a [[kadis-kot]] board, and he and [[Naomi Wildman]] await the arrival of the Borg children. They enter with Seven, who hovers near the table to supervise. Naomi compliments Mezoti on the braid in her hair, but when Mezoti offers to teach Naomi braiding, Seven stops her from engaging in irrelevant conversation since she has allotted only one hour for recreational activities. As the game begins, Naomi notices that Azan and Rebi are cheating, and Mezoti reveals they are using their [[neural interface]] to share information. Seven enacts [[Punishment Protocol 9-Alpha]] and makes the twins stand in a corner. Icheb stands up to Seven, saying he won't participate if the twins aren't allowed to rejoin the game. He knocks the kadis-kot pieces off the table, prompting Seven to tell him to exercise the Punishment Protocol as well. Icheb refuses and angrily leaves.  In Ballard's quarters, she and Kim unpack her belongings. Tuvok had instructed Kim to recycle the items, but he found he couldn't. Ballard sloppily throws her things around the room, and she and Kim discuss the time they spent living across the hall from one another at [[Starfleet Academy]]. In the course of the conversation, Kim reveals that he delivered the eulogy at her funeral. At first, he won't tell her what he said, but eventually he relents and says that he told the mourners to live by Ballard's own philosophy, ""Own the day,"" her favorite saying. Breaking the awkward silence that follows, Ballard jokes that with her bald Kobali head, she'll no longer need one of the items Kim had packed away: her hairbrush.  The Doctor summons Ballard and Kim to sickbay, where he has completed his analysis. He tells her a [[genetic pathogen]] has altered her Human DNA into a Kobali [[protein]] structure and that there isn't enough Human genetic material to make her Human again. He can, however, alter her appearance so that she looks Human, even though her physiology remains Kobali. Ballard opts for the treatments, the first of which restores her skin color and face.  === Act Three === In the mess hall, Neelix serves Ballard a [[Jiballian berry salad]], which she has been looking forward to as Kobali cuisine consists of only a gray paste. The salad, however, doesn't live up to her expectations, tasting metallic due to her Kobali taste buds.  Ballard reports to her shift in engineering, a minute early to Torres' surprise. Torres assigns her to work on an alignment error in the dilithium matrix caused by an unknown reason. Ballard easily corrects the error, but is taken aback when Torres tells her that she spoke in Kobali while describing what she was doing. Ballard notices other engineering crew staring at her.  Chakotay visits Seven in [[astrometrics]]. She shows him the rigid schedule she has developed for the Borg children, including specific allotted times for ""fun."" Chakotay says she's treating the children as if they were still drones on a [[Borg cube|cube]], making them do the same things at the same times and not allowing them to express their individuality. She asks to be relieved of duty as the children's guardian, but Chakotay denies her request.  Kim is on his way to ask Ballard to join him [[ice skating]] on the [[holodeck]] when Paris catches up with him and ribs him about his track record with women, now including the ""dearly departed."" Kim insists that while he might have thought about pursuing Ballard at one time, he closed that door when they were both assigned to ''Voyager.'' Paris tells him that door may be creaking open.  In sickbay, The Doctor has fully restored Ballard's Human appearance, including a full head of red hair, a departure from her original color. Kim invites her to go skating, but Ballard says she already has a date: she's been asked to the captain's quarters for dinner.  To Janeway's chagrin, a charred [[pot roast]] materializes in her [[replicator]]. Ballard arrives, in formal dress uniform, which the captain tells her wasn't necessary. She also explains that she has liquefied the pot roast and will be serving [[peanut butter and jelly sandwich]]es instead. As the two sit down, Janeway comments that Tuvok has presented her with 37 ways of repelling a potential Kobali attack. Ballard asks if the list includes Janeway's pot roast, and then immediately apologizes for her remark. Janeway, however, isn't offended, finding the comment funny and tells Ballard they're not on the bridge and she may speak freely. Ballard then questions the captain about why she chose her to go on the away mission that led to her death. Janeway asserts that she felt Ballard was best suited for the job, but Ballard points out that Tuvok had far more experience conducting away missions and Torres more expertise in mining dilithium. She asks if the captain sent her instead because she was closer to the other two officers. Janeway wonders if Ballard blames her for her death, but Ballard assures her she doesn't, saying, ""''Never harbor anger to those who brought you death, for they gave you the chance to live again.''"" Suddenly embarrassed that she's quoting Kobali philosophy, Ballard abruptly leaves the room, saying she ""shouldn't have come.""  Later, Ballard dreams of attending her own funeral, where various crew members tell her she doesn't belong there. She is awakened when she sees the image of a Kobali man reaching to her and addressing her as ""[[Jhet'leya]].""  Ballard goes to Kim's quarters, where she talks with him about the crew members staring at her in engineering and how she began babbling in front of the captain. Kim promises to help her through her difficulties and she wonders why he is always so nice to her. Surprised that she doesn't know why, Kim admits that he rearranged his Academy schedule so they would have the same classes and allowed her to teach him to ice skate even though he hates the cold. He says he's been crazy about her since they met. They then kiss.  === Act Four === The Borg children are sculpting when Seven arrives to inspect their work. The twins have created cubes 1/1000th the size of Borg cubes. Seven is impressed by Icheb's creation &ndash; a 26-sided [[polyhedron]] comprised of hexagons, octagons, and squares &ndash; but confused by Mezoti's, a crude sculpture of Seven. Seven reminds Mezoti that they were instructed to create a geometric shape, but pronounces the work demonstrative of ingenuity and individuality. Icheb is shocked when Seven elects not to punish Mezoti and tells the children to ""resume [their] disorder.""  Kim awakens in his quarters to find Ballard sitting in the dark. ""''They're coming,''"" she says.  A Kobali ship hails ''Voyager''. [[Q'ret]], the man from Ballard's dream, appears, saying he is there to retrieve Jhet'leya, his daughter. Janeway informs him that Ballard has made her intentions of not returning to the Kobali known, but Q'ret begs to be allowed to speak with her.  Kim tells Ballard that she doesn't have to meet with Q'ret, but she says it's time to stop running and that she wants to face him. Q'ret is shocked by Ballard's Human appearance and her insistence that her name is Lyndsay, not Jhet'leya. Q'ret and Kim bicker about each culture's customs and funeral rites. Q'ret says that in most Kobali, a complete loss of memory accompanies the reanimation, but there are some who retain their memories. He tries to convince Ballard that Lyndsay died three years ago, and Jhet'leya is a different person. He tells Ballard that her Kobali sister misses her and asks what to tell her. Ballard says ""''Tell her that her sister's dead''"" and leaves the meeting.  Q'ret tells Janeway that he won't give his daughter up, and promises to return with reinforcements.  In the mess hall, Kim finds Ballard eating the gray paste she mentioned earlier. To cheer her up, he offers to help her with No. 32 on her list, ""Make Tuvok laugh."" He tells her they can tweak one of the Vulcan's holodeck programs so that the {{dis|monk|occupation}}s at the [[Temple of T'Panit]] begin chanting [[Ferengi]] [[limerick]]s. A distracted Ballard can think only of Q'ret. Kim can't believe Q'ret had the audacity to call himself Ballard's father and wonders what her Human father, a university professor, would have to say about that. Ballard realizes she has no memory at all of her Human parent. She decides to join Kim in the holodeck, but as they start to leave, she doubles over in pain and her face begins to revert to its Kobali appearance.  === Act Five === The Doctor discovers that the Kobali pathogen has adapted and Ballard will now require treatments twice daily to maintain a Human appearance. Angered, she questions how she can do her job, or anything else for that matter, if she's always in sickbay. She shouts at The Doctor and Kim in Kobali. Horrified by her own behavior, she bolts from the room.  Kim finds Ballard on her shuttle, where he asks her to stop the treatments. He says he doesn't care if she looks Kobali, Human, or even [[Bolian]] as long as she's happy. But she is convinced she no longer fits in. She says other alien members of the crew grew up in their own cultures and know who they are, but ever since she returned, she hasn't felt right. At first, she thought ''Voyager'' had changed, but now she realizes it is she who has changed. The girl Kim fell in love with died three years ago.  The Kobali attack, and Kim and Ballard rush to the bridge. Ballard tells Janeway to surrender her to the attacking ships, saying she doesn't belong on ''Voyager'' anymore. Kim tries to get the captain not to listen, but Ballard assures Janeway that she knows what she is saying. Kim tells her he doesn't want to lose her, but she knows he already did. This time, however, they've had the chance to say goodbye.  *""''[[Captain's log]], Stardate 53679.4. The Doctor has stopped Ensign Ballard's treatments, and her Kobali physiology is already beginning to reassert itself. All but one of us have said our goodbyes.''""  In the transporter room, Kim says goodbye to Ballard in her alien language, having taught himself some Kobali phrases. She tells him his gesture is sweet, but that he's just told her ""''The comets are tiresome.''"" He expresses regret that she didn't finish all the items on her list, but she says she took care of what really mattered. Ballard kisses him goodbye and returns to the Kobali people.  Later, in the mess hall, Kim sits alone holding Ballard's hairbrush. When Mezoti approaches and admires the object, he gives it to her as a gift, telling her that Ballard would be pleased it went to someone with such pretty hair. Mezoti says that Seven is allowing the Borg children to go to the holodeck by themselves and run any program they like. She invites him to join them. Kim asks if she's ever heard of the Temple of T'Panit, a Vulcan program. Mezoti thinks it sounds boring, but Kim assures her they'll make a few tweaks.  "
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"   ==Summary== ===Teaser===  In [[Quark's]], [[Jadzia Dax]] unsuccessfully tries to convince [[Worf]] to let her throw a party with the crew of the {{USS|Saratoga|2374}} in their [[quarters]]. She almost has him convinced, when he bolts at the last moment. [[Quark]] saves them from an awkward silence by informing Worf that the [[holosuite]] is ready; once the [[Klingon]] is gone, he asks about the party. Dismayed at Dax's answer, Quark goes about his business and delivers a bouquet of [[Bajoran lilac]]s to a nearby [[Kira Nerys|Kira]]. This immediately catches Dax's interest, so she follows Kira out of the bar and onto the [[Promenade]].  Kira has ordered the flowers for herself, despite the fact that she doesn't like flowers, to commemorate her late [[Kira Meru|mother]]'s [[2314|60th]] [[birthday]]. While she never knew her mother, as she was only three years old when she died at the refugee camp, Kira knows Bajoran lilacs were her mother's favorites. She tells Dax how proud she has always been of her mother for what she did and who, according to her father, was the bravest woman he ever met.   Later that night, Kira receives an encoded [[hail|transmission]] from [[Dukat]] in her [[quarters]]. In a bout of wanting to come clean with his emotions and himself, he smugly claims to have known Kira's mother and that they were lovers until the day she died. Rather than what Kira believes &ndash; namely that her mother died at the [[Singha]] refugee camp on [[Bajor]] &ndash; Dukat claims that her father told her a lie because he couldn't bear to tell his children that their mother had left him for Dukat. Kira cannot believe her ears and is disgusted at what Dukat tells her, but at the same time she is shaken at the amount of detail Dukat appears to know about her mother and becomes uneasy.   ===Act One=== While Kira doesn't want to believe Dukat, too many things he claimed to know about her mother were true, and there is now significant doubt in her mind after she does some research of her own. She has a hard time confronting the issue, however, and takes her frustration with the situation out on the people around her, such as [[Doctor]] [[Julian Bashir|Bashir]] and [[Chief]] [[Miles O'Brien|O'Brien]] who are discussing their next [[holodeck|holo]] adventure involving the [[Alamo]] while on duty.   She eventually decides to do something about her situation after talking with [[Odo]] so she asks [[Captain]] [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] for permission to use the [[Orb of Time]] down on [[Bajor]] at the [[Temple of Iponu]] to find out for herself, because she knows the [[Vedek Assembly]] will allow her access to the [[Orb]] if the {{Emissary}} approves it. He is ambivalent about Kira's idea due to [[Starfleet]]'s [[temporal displacement policy]], but Kira insists that this matter has nothing to do with the [[Federation]], firmly believing that the [[Prophet]]s will protect and guide her to do the right thing (that is, not disturb the timeline). Sisko eventually agrees to let her try.  In the temple, Kira opens the Orb casing. In a flash she is sent back in time and finds herself at a refugee camp during the [[Occupation of Bajor|occupation]], surrounded by starving Bajorans. After a few seconds she finds herself face to face with her own family; her father, [[Kira Taban|Taban]], and her mother [[Kira Meru|Meru]], along with herself and her brothers, [[Kira Reon|Reon]] and [[Kira Pohl|Pohl]].  ===Act Two===  A couple of Bajoran men try to force Taban to give them food, but Nerys intervenes by forcefully telling the men to go stand in line like everyone else and get their own food. They refuse so Nerys is forced to fight them to get them to leave. Grateful for Kira's efforts, Meru introduces herself, her husband, her sons Reon and Pohl, and her daughter Nerys. The little Nerys wants to know the name of the woman who helped her family, so, pressed for a name, the older Nerys claims her name is [[Luma Rahl]].   Shortly thereafter, [[Basso]], a Bajoran [[collaborator]], and two [[Cardassian]] soldiers come and collect various women, including Meru and Nerys, as ""[[comfort woman|comfort women]]"" for the Cardassian soldiers. Having received the orders from their [[Prefect]] Gul Dukat, they hand pick the women and drag them away from their families. Meru screams out to her husband who is shaking and is in tears, telling him that she loves him, asking him to tell her children to not forget her.    Nerys, Meru and the others are taken to the nearly completed station [[Terok Nor]], where they are given quarters, plenty of food, fine dresses and told to clean up and linger in the station's [[sonic shower]]s so they can look their best the next day. While Nerys tries to console Meru, telling her that everything will be fine and that they would get out of there soon, Meru is distracted by all the wonderful foods she finds on the table in their quarters, such as fresh [[moba]], [[katterpod bean]]s, [[hasperat]] and more. Meru eagerly begins to eat, not having seen many of these dishes in ages, but Nerys is not as enthused and in fact wants no part of it.    She wants to try to contact the [[Bajoran Resistance]], which likely has a cell somewhere on the station when Meru, amid her indulgence, begins to cry, as she misses her family and wonders about her children. Sobbing, she says that she wants to believe that the Cardassians were telling the truth when they said that they would take care of her family, but Nerys tells her to not count on it. She insists they find a way to get out of the station and then join a resistance cell somewhere. She comforts Meru and as she embraces her face, she notices the scar on her cheek from where she failed to show a Cardassian officer proper respect. Nerys continues to embrace her face lovingly, telling her that the scar does not look so bad after all. Meru wonders why Nerys keeps helping her; Nerys replies that she doesn't have many friends and Meru tells her she definitely has one now. The next day Basso commends them on their hard work of transforming themselves into beautiful new women. He tells them that their former lives have ended, that their pasts have been erased, and that they have one purpose &ndash; and one purpose only: to provide comfort and care to the Cardassian officers stationed on Terok Nor. He warns them that failure to comply would result in their families being sent to [[labor camp]]s for the rest of their lives. While he carries on with his threats and the long list of consequences that will follow disobedience, Dukat interrupts him. He welcomes the women and seems quite compassionate. He assures them that the picture they have of Cardassians as a cruel and heartless peoples is wrong, and he hopes to be able to show these women the extent to which Cardassians are capable of great kindness.   When Meru dares to ask what will happen to their families, rather than have her removed, he approaches her and kindly tells her that they will be taken care of. Before turning away from her, however, he discovers the scar on her face. He immediately orders Basso to retrieve a [[dermal regenerator]] and fixes the scar, calling it an unfortunate reminder of the gulf that exists between their peoples. Much to Nerys' dismay, Meru seems a bit too taken away by Dukat's act of kindness.  ===Act Three=== The women are taken to what will later become the [[wardroom]] on [[Deep Space 9]], where various Cardassian officers are seen forcing themselves on the Bajoran women. Meru and Nerys stand in a corner with Meru smiling; still somewhat disturbed at Meru's earlier attitude toward Dukat, Nerys asks her what she is smiling about. Meru says that she is laughing at the [[Prophet]]s' apparent sense of humor as she always dreamed about having enough food to eat and pretty clothes to wear but now that she has them, she feels horrible. Before she knows, she is dragged away by a sleazy, drunken Cardassian. Meanwhile, a middle-aged Cardassian man has Nerys sit on his lap and seems [[drunken]]ly amused by her visible hatred toward his kind. When Dukat enters, he finds the younger officer forcing himself on Meru and intervenes, apologizing profusely and having Meru sent back to her quarters. Despite the apparent compassion, the officer with Nerys has seen this act before and is able to predict precisely the line Dukat feeds Meru, who &ndash; he says &ndash; is now ""off limits"" to the other Cardassians. Meru is gone when Nerys returns to their quarters, but Basso and two guards are there retrieving her belongings. Nerys demands to see Meru and gets into a fistfight, which she inevitably loses when a Cardassian officer violently strikes her down with the butt of his rifle. They take her to the fenced-off area of Terok Nor's Promenade, which is reserved for Bajoran slave laborers.  ===Act Four===  A few weeks later, Nerys is getting her [[soup]] from the server, a man named [[Halb Daier]], who has heard word of Meru's whereabouts. He follows her to a table and claims Meru has been on vacation with Dukat from which she just returned. To the man, Meru is nothing but a [[collaborator]] and Nerys has no reason to care for her, but Nerys insists otherwise. He tries to get her to join the Resistance, but as she could affect the course of history, she does her best to stay out of such things. Their conversation is interrupted when Basso and a pair of guards arrive to take Nerys away.  They take her hrough a security scanner and to Dukat's and Meru's quarters, where Meru is waiting for her. She is seen relaxed and fully rested, wearing a beautiful dress and smiling as Dukat walks into the room with a vase full of the Bajoran lilacs she loves so much. Nerys is beside herself with both astonishment and disgust when she sees Meru's and Dukat's interaction with one another as lovers.  It turns out that Meru is the one who sent for Nerys, as she is her only friend and she is lonely. Dukat senses that Nerys doesn't like him and assures her that he has been treating Meru with the utmost respect and consideration. He then kisses Meru goodbye and leaves.   Meru turns to Nerys and tells her that he is in fact very different from what she expected. She insists that Dukat is not a monster, making up excuses and repeating the ones he has given her about the [[Occupation of Bajor|occupation]]. As disgusted as Nerys is when Meru talks about Dukat's kindness, Meru insists that things are not so simple and that Nerys does not know what she has been through. Nerys tries to open Meru's eyes, telling her that while she is sitting in the room sipping tea and playing parlor games, Dukat is carrying out the [[genocide|extermination]] of their people. When Meru keeps defending Dukat and continues regurgitating his lies, Nerys becomes furious, telling her that he has taken her away from her children and husband, wondering how she can forget him so quickly. Meru once again insists that Dukat is helping them out with food and medication, but Nerys cannot believe what she is hearing as, in her eyes, nothing excuses what Meru is doing. Nerys says that she is using the ""I am doing it for my children"" line as an excuse and that in fact she is there for herself only, as she is a collaborator not because she is sharing Dukat's bed but because she allowed herself to start enjoying it. She storms off the quarters, telling Meru that she is going back where she belongs.   Back in the ghetto area, Nerys talks with the Resistance member again and gets a [[Bajoran earring]] with an explosive built into it. It has a three minute fuse and cannot be disarmed once it has been activated. Halb tells her to not tell Dukat's Bajoran mistress about what she is doing, even if it is to save her life, and Nerys replies that he need not worry, because as a coward and collaborator, she ultimately deserves what she gets.  ===Act Five=== Kira goes to the guards and tells them that she has decided which side of the fence she wants to be on. She asks to be taken to Meru so she can apologize to her. When Basso returns her, Nerys, as expected, finds Meru with Dukat, sitting at the table, laughing and having a good time. She tells Meru that she has changed her mind and wants to be friends again. Meru accepts her apology and asks Dukat to get her some quarters close-by.   Before leaving, Dukat hands a transmission encoded in a [[optolythic data rod|data rod]] to Meru. As he goes to an adjacent study room and Meru prepares to watch the message, Nerys casually activates and then slips the bomb into a [[flower]] vase. While she waits for the right moment to leave the room, she suddenly hears the message which turns out to be from her father, who talks about how well they have been treated since Meru was taken from them, how much the children are thriving now that they are back home again and how much he misses her. He praises her for having saved all of their lives and he cries for the sacrifice she is making. As he talks, Meru begins to cry, touching the screen from which her husband speaks. That is when Nerys realizes that maybe her mother is not the heartless traitor and collaborator she thought she was. Nerys yells for Dukat and takes him and Meru out into the corridor, where they narrowly escape the detonation of the bomb (though two of Dukat's guards are killed). As they are escaping, Dukat calls out for Meru and tries to shield her from the blast, showing that he does have some true affection for her. Suddenly, the [[orb experience]] ends and Nerys finds herself back in her own time again.   She discusses her experiences with Sisko, telling him that until this day, the line between a collaborator and a devoted Bajoran was very clear to her; she always believed her mother to be a hero who died for the cause while she despised collaborators as the traitors they were. Sisko tells her that Meru did what she had to do to save her family, but Nerys insists that it does not make it right. Sisko agrees but notes that it was her mother's decision to make. She tells Sisko that her mother died [[2353|seven years later]] in a Cardassian [[hospital]], wondering if he knows just how many Bajorans died while her mother was comfortably sipping [[Kanar]] with a genocidal murderer. She is heartbroken and disappointed. When Sisko asks her why she saved her mother's life despite her newfound hatred for her, she replies that while there is a part of her that wishes she hadn't, in the end &ndash; no matter what Meru did &ndash; she was still her mother."

== Plot ==
Painter Jack Craig gains himself a wealthy patron when he sells a morbid painting. He soon finds that in order to please his patron, he must continue to paint pictures of death - and this leads him down a murderous path.

== Summary ==
[[Jack Craig|Jack]] (Tim Roth) is an artist who is down on his luck. He joins a therapy group to help him with his violent intrusive thoughts, One of the other members of the group, Sharon (Roya Megnot), takes a liking to him.

One evening, Jack's downstairs neighbor has the music on too loud and Jack asks him to turn down the music. The neighbor only turns it up louder. In his frustration, Jack shouts at him and accidentally drops a pot on the neighbor's head. The neighbor falls off his balcony and to his death. Instead of calling for help, Jack immediately snaps photos of the dead man, to use as a reference for his next painting.

Jack's painting of his dead neighbor is purchased by a wealthy, morbid art collector Malcolm Mayflower (William Atherton) who becomes his patron. The collector pays Jack an advance commission for another painting. After a heated argument with his superintendent, Jack shoves her down the stairs onto an open pair of shears, snaps a photo, and collects her blood to use in the painting. Mayflower happily purchases this painting, too. Meanwhile his newfound success is keeping Jack from attending his therapy sessions. Sharon visits him and is initially excited by Jack's successes. However, Jack uncovers a morbid painting he has been working on, and says to her: ""you don't really know me"". Not understanding the connection between the piece and the superintendent's death, and seeing Jack as a typical artist with a tortured soul, Sharon gets turned on by this and advances towards him saying: ""Yes I do"" and kisses him. They start to passionately make love in Jack's apartment. During their lovemaking, Sharon tells Jack not to ""hold back"" in his passion. This triggers a mental episode in which Jack envisions Sharon as Mayflower and tries to choke her and bash her head in. He immediately returns to his senses, but their lovemaking immediately stops. Realizing that Jack loves Sharon and wanting to cut ties with the wealthy patron, Jack dresses and tells Sharon not to go anywhere. Sharon is left naked under the sheets at Jack's apartment.

Mayflower wants one more painting from Jack, but he declines to make more, despite the large sum he intends to pay. Satisfied, he goes back to his apartment for Sharon. By now, Sharon found the super's blood paint, and Jack's photos, connecting the dots that Jack murdered the two people. When Jack arrives, she runs away from him out into the road, getting hit by a taxi. At the hospital, Jack is told Sharon needs a specialized surgeon to save her life, and that the surgery is far too expensive for the uninsured Sharon to afford. For his final painting, Jack kills a random stranger in the hospital parking lot, drags him to an alley, and uses his blood and gore to finger-paint onto a piece of discarded cardboard. He sells the bloody cardboard to Mayflower, who gives Jack the money to pay for the surgery. He then runs back to the hospital, only to find out that the random stranger he killed was the very surgeon who was going to operate on her. Sharon dies.

As Jack watches the nurses take away Sharon's corpse, a police officer interrogates him, saying that he found Jack's paintbrush at the scene of the crime.

Farnsworth|Cubert]] over-clocks Bender so he can process faster. As a result, they beat their opponents, sending them crying to [[Mom]]. Suspicious, Mom hacks into Cubert's game box feed and learns about the overclocking. Mom becomes worried that if people learn how to overclock her [[Robot]]s, then they will have no incentive to buy new robots. Mom has [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] and Cubert arrested for voiding Bender's license agreement. Turns out, Hubert forgot that he signed the license agreement due to being too lazy to read it over in order to get Bender to bend a straw for him. At trial, Cubert and the Professor are ordered to locate Bender, and are forced to pay $10,000 every day until he is found, threatening to bankrupt [[Planet Express]].  Meanwhile, Bender continues to gather processing power, eventually gaining deity-like intelligence and powers, enabling him to anticipate future events, such as Mom sending robots to capture him to restore him to factory settings. Bender sets an elaborate trap involving a microwaved turkey, a volleyball net and [[John A. Zoidberg|Dr. Zoidberg]] to beat these robots and steal their processing chips, increasing his capacities even further. The side-effect of this is that Bender requires an extreme amount of coolant to prevent himself from overheating, causing him to leave Planet Express to find another, larger source of coolant.  Meanwhile, [[Turanga Leela|Leela]] feels like her relationship with [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] is in a rut and leaves Planet Express to become a space real estate agent. Depressed, Fry talks with [[Randy Munchnik]] about Bender's disappearance. Despite Randy's suggestion that Bender would probably go to a place with a lot of coolant and power, Fry decides to commit suicide by falling off Niagara Falls in a barrel. But amazingly, he finds himself in a cave underneath the falls, where Bender has developed into an omnipotent being, using the waterfalls as his new cooling system. Fry tries to convince Bender to help Professor Farnsworth and Cubert, but Bender is unconcerned with their troubles, stating that they are guilty and will be convicted. Fry asks Bender if he has a future with Leela, but Bender does not answer and tells him to leave.  After Fry returns to the trial, Bender has a change of heart and appears in court, but he is ignored. However, he assures his friends that the jury probably didn't have to unfairly accuse Cubert, a minor. Fearing that Cubert will gain the jury's sympathy, Mom decides to drop the charges against Cubert while still attempting to prosecute the Professor. However, Bender seeks a mistrial on the grounds of double jeopardy, declaring that by dropping charges against Cubert who is the Professor's clone, Mom is unable to press charges against the Professor for the same crime because they are legally the same person. Enraged that she cannot prosecute the Professor, Mom forcibly captures Bender and resets him to factory settings. As he is carried away, Fry asks Bender about his future with Leela. Bender says there's no time, but proves he has enough to trick Zoidberg into getting hit by a ceiling fan.  As Bender has been restored to factory dumb-setting, Leela returns to Fry, who still wonders what the future holds for both of them. Bender reveals that he had written down his prediction of their future, which Fry and Leela silently read together. The contents of the prediction are not shown, but Fry and Leela's reactions indicate that their relationship will have its ups and downs but will ultimately have a happy ending.   "

== Overview ==
""Beyond a Joke"" is a [[Kryten]]-centric episode, as the [[DivaDroid International]] [[Series 4000]] [[Mechanoid]] literally blows his top due a previously unknown, pent-up [[Nega-Drive|negativity chip]]. The rest of [[Boys from the Dwarf|the crew]] of ''[[Starbug]]'', exasperated when Kryten also explodes all his [[Spare Head]]s, pretend to be [[Kinitawowi]] to trade with a [[Simulant]] and obtain more heads for the Series 4000. They are double-crossed, leaving Kryten stranded aboard the [[Simulant Trader]]'s [[SS Centauri|superior craft]].

== Summary ==
''Starbug'' passes a derelict spaceship, ''[[SS Centauri]]'', which [[Kryten]] scavenges for supplies. He finds some live lobsters in [[stasis]] and brings them aboard to cook a fine supper. This is convenient, since it is the anniversary of his rescue from the wreck of the ''[[Nova 5]]'' and he is eager to celebrate. When he first tells [[Dave Lister|Lister]] about the meal he worries that it's [[Space Weevil]]. However [[Kristine Kochanski|Kochanski]] intends to educate Lister and [[Cat]] on the finer points of etiquette by introducing them to a [[Total Immersion Video Game|virtual reality environment]] called ""[[Pride and Prejudice Land]]"" in ""Jane Austen World"", an Artificial Reality program also found on ''Centauri''. Kryten's plans for a lobster supper, which he had been preparing for two days, are postponed so the others can do to the AR Suite, much to Kryten's anger.

Entering the program Lister, Cat and Kochanski meet up with the Bennett sisters as well as their mother and start to enjoy their company. Kochanski enjoying the mentally stimulating conversation, while Cat just enjoys being around five hot sisters. Kryten decides to force the issue of supper and enters the program too, proceeding to take care of the sisters using stealth tactics. As the remaining Bennetts proceed to a gazebo, Kryten has decided to wipe out the family once and for all using a [[T-72 Tank]] from a World War II simulation. Using its weapons, he destroys the gazebo in a massive explosion before announcing supper is ready.

Back on ''Starbug'' the crew begin nervously eating the lobster supper under the watchful eye of a nearly livid Kryten. They try their best not to push the almost deranged mechanoid over the edge, but then Lister requests brown ketchup to go with the lobster. This is too much for Kryten and he goes berserk, literally blowing his top — his head explodes. Lister and Kochanski try to attach spare heads to Kryten, but they instantly explode as soon as Kryten is switched on. After exhausting all of the spare heads they have, Lister suggests that they board ''SS Centauri'' again and look for some spare mechanoid heads there. However, they discover a [[Simulant Trader|rogue simulant captain]] who has since commandeered ''Centauri'' and who is also assisted by a [[Kinitawowi]] tribesman. This gives Kochanski the idea to disguise themselves as [[GELF]]s and they successfully negotiate with the Simulant to buy his stock of mechanoid heads. When the crew go back aboard Starbug, they find that the Simulant's own GELF has ransacked the ship and stolen Kryten's body. The Simulant and the GELF then escape with Kryten aboard ''Centauri''. ''Starbug'' cannot catch up as ''Centauri'' is much faster, traveling at warp speed.

On board ''Centauri'', the defect which caused Kryten to blow up his head is fixed. There Kryten meets another [[mechanoid]] named [[Able]] who is a servant to the Simulant and who, it turns out, is from the same batch as Kryten (a [[Series 4000|4000 series]]) and carries the same serial number. This means that Kryten and Able are, in effect, brothers. However, Able is a ""zoney"" — he is addicted to a narcotic known as ""[[Outrozone]]"" that is specially designed for mechanoids. Abuse of this had corrupted Able's circuit boards.

The ''Starbug'' crew deceive the simulant into thinking that they've planted a bomb on ''Centauri'' and the simulant teleports aboard ''Starbug ''along with the GELF, Kryten and Able. Lister tries to bargain with the Simulant, who tells Kryten how to access a secret file in his memory. Kryten does so and suddenly becomes extremely depressed. Able remembers that this is how the simulant broke his spirit and turned him into an outrozone addict and suddenly decides to switch sides. In the confusion that results, the GELF is killed and the Simulant is knocked out and sent back to ''Centauri''.

As ''Starbug'' flees, a morose Kryten reveals to Lister what the secret file told him; the entire 4000 series of mechanoids was a spiteful joke by their creator, [[Professor Mamet]]. They were designed to be a parody of [[John Warburton]], a fiance who jilted her, and as such were made pompous, ridiculous looking, and overbearing. Further, all their negative emotions were stored on a ""[[Nega-Drive|nega-drive]]"" and when it becomes full they literally blow up, referencing Warburton's own tendency to explode with anger. Lister comforts him by assuring his friend that he has evolved beyond his original personality.

''Starbug'' hides in an [[asteroid belt]], hoping to escape from the simulant via silent running. However, Able carelessly gives away their position and ''Centauri'' begins attacking ''Starbug''. When it becomes obvious that ''Starbug'' has no chance of surviving this battle, Able takes an [[escape pod]] and attacks ''Centauri'' with the pent up emotions stored in Kryten's nega-drive, causing the Simulant to first suffer a fit of depression, then go berserk and start firing his [[bazookoid]] at the ship's controls, eventually causing ''Centauri'' to explode. The escape pod is blasted away and crashes on a nearby moon, smashing Able beyond any hope of repair. Kryten retrieves Able's body, acknowledging him finally as his brother.

In the end the ''Starbug'' crew visits the Kryten's new ""[[Pride_and_Prejudice_Land#Curryworld|Curryworld]]"" AR program, a variation on Jane Austen World set in a contemporary Indian restaurant, accompanied the Bennett sisters from Pride and Prejudice Land. Although the sisters enjoy their curries, unfortunately the [[curry]] is too hot for even Lister due to a ""bug in the program"", with literal fire belching from the mouths of the Dwarfers.
